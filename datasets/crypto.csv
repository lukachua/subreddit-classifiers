0,CryptoCurrency,Markmanus,Is Binance afraid of Crypto.com?,"So I have to assume as the title says above. In the last couple of weeks, especially since CDC ([Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)) started their aggressive marketing around summer they had a large % growth in volume and overall global presence. I have noticed that CDC has different statistics on different crypto analysis websites.  


First I thought it was just a normal difference as it is not easy to collect statistical data especially with high accuracy, but then I have noticed the difference is happening on Coinmarketcap, while other sites show same data...then I remembered that Binance purchased coinmarketcap, and I decided to dive into this investigation.

&amp;#x200B;

# Coinmarketcap statistics.

Binance first in ranking While CDC only able to grab the 21st based on coinmarketcap ""Custom"" ranking system.

Binance reported a 26.826 Billion in Volume

While they only reported a 561 Million for Crypto.Com

# Livecoinwatch statistics

Surprisingly a more independent website reports are greatly different from the one above.

Binance volume is barely 25 Billion

[Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) volume is 2.73 Billion (5 times more than on coinmarketcap)

There is still a good 10X difference in volume, but just 4 months ago this number was a 100.  


I know both exchanges are centralized, but for me [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) earned way more respect as they refused to ban validators on their chain who regularly changed commission and with that kinda scamming staking people, because they want to be decentralised as possible, instead they created a warning and marked validators in the ranking so people know they tend to change commission regularly.",1635177574,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfjw21/is_binance_afraid_of_cryptocom/
9,CryptoCurrency,frostybitz,What's been your worst move in Crypto? (So far),"We've all made silly mistakes since our inception in the cryptoverse. Whether that be selling too early, buying too late, FOMOing in cos you couldn't wait, believing in shitcoins destined to fail, selling your doge before all the hype, buying shiba inu (only kidding, congrats to all of those that made money), selling a kidney for BTC. You know, that sort of thing.

Well I thought it might be fun to share our own embarrassing stories. I've seen plenty of posts mentioning best/worst performers, solid projects and shit projects, etc. But never some juicy fuck-up stories that might give people a good laugh. 

**Note:** you can go into as much or as little detail as you like. This isn't the IRS trying to catch you out...
*Or is it?* 
**Please do consider your privacy and security.**

**Note 2:** reposted as I didn't meet the karma requirement the 1st time.


Well *I guess* I'll go first. When I first heard of Bitcoin, I bought 0.25 for around $600 and sold it for $550 a whole fifteen minutes later because I thought it was crashing. Funny to look back on. But I do still wonder how I could have been *that* narrow minded.",1635177350,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfjt5m/whats_been_your_worst_move_in_crypto_so_far/
10,CryptoCurrency,Mediocre-Sale8473,IRS wants to monitor your bank account flow. This should have people worried regardless of whether or not your accounts are legit. (Link inside),"Ok so I'll start with the article link from NPR:

https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1048485043/irs-banks-taxes-fight-explainer



Obvious issues here:

*Violations of privacy. Like...holy shit GTFO and stop looking at my bank account Karen.

*Individuals *are not* the problem - corporations exploiting tax loopholes and tax havens are the real issue here. Unchecked power, etc.

*Forces people to use shady methods of concealing transactions. Obviously not an up and up thing, but also...Monero exists.

*This is absolutely an attack on crypto, but with a different approach than ""regulate"".


To that 4th point: There was a threshold amount of $600 that the treasury proposed:

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-administration-wants-irs-to-monitor-peoples-bank-accounts-more-closely-will-it-catch-tax-cheats-or-invade-privacy-11633560204

There was massive backlash, so it was scaled up to $10,000.


But here is the reality we are all in:

If we cash out any crypto to a form of Fiat that has to go through a US bank account to clear that now gets slammed by the IRS. Now again, it's a near-0% chance you are audited (especially unelder $400k/yr income).


But say you made out amazingly well on something.

Say you dropped $10k into SHIB, and now you are up to $20k (it was up 99% for the year as of the other day IIRC). Maybe you YOLO'D into it with $50k or $100k, and now you cashed out and made $100k or $200k.

This gets painful as the numbers go up. And while I understand the average person here has sub $1k invested don't be fooled that this isn't a dig at lower income stuff.

Maybe you get WIC or food stamps or some type of supplemental income. Well suddenly the IRS sees your extra few grand distribution and now you get a letter telling you that you no longer qualify for that benefit. Puts a real damper on any future investing. Probably kills it for you outright or at least for a couple of years until you stabilize again.


This is another form of suppression plain and simple.


But what do I know? I'm over here trying to figure out what the next canine shitcoin will be anyway.

15,CryptoCurrency,Many_Arm7466,Financial Lifehacks To Get Extra Money for Buying Dips,"Hello there do you wish you could put some more money into Crypto dip, but you already allocated your DCA funds and went broke 3 dips ago. Well I got some nice little lifehacks to cut costs and save money to have a little extra for crypto dips. 

1. Cut toothpaste tube in half when it’s near empty. To get all the extra toothpaste stuck near the bottom and can now put toothpaste money towards tip. 

2. Do you know your paper towels can be dried and reused. Now you can save the fortune you would spend on paper towels and put it towards buying the Dip.

My personal fav:

3. Bidet; these can be bought fairly cheaply on Amazon, and over the years you would save a fortune since you no longer need to buy toilet paper. More money for dips and a cleaner bum sounds like a win.

28,CryptoCurrency,Illustrious_Ad1887,Anyone else feeling like AnchorUSD is a complete scam?,"
I haven’t been able to send any of my coins to a different wallet for months now. I’ve successfully sent some coins to my Gemini wallet maybe 3-4 months ago but then out of nowhere I could only send a small amount (less than $100) and then a couple days later I couldn’t send anything. Now I when I try to send my coin to a different wallet I get a message on the bottom in red letters that says “Withdrawal amount too high. You currently may withdraw at most $77.83 (or equivalent), due to pending deposits. First of all, I have no pending deposits. Second, the amount they say I can withdraw up to changes every time I try to withdraw and is a random number like the one above (ex. $66.72, $200.87, $100.82, etc.). Not even every day, every single attempt I make it changes to a random number. Sometimes when the system gives me a higher amount like $100-$200 I try to send it to my Gemini wallet (because for specific coins you can only send it to a different wallet if you’re sending over a certain number—for example you can only send MATIC if you have 100+ coins) and then I get a pop up message that says “Transaction cannot be completed. Biometric verification failed.” 

I have seen many people on Twitter and Reddit going through similar issues with no response from AnchorUSD’s support team. They also have multiple complaints on BBB that are unresolved, and I saw someone’s email that they received from BBB after writing one:

“BBB has made several attempts to contact the business regarding the above referenced complaint. We regret to inform you that we have not received a response from the company. If you wish to purse this matter further you may want to contact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.”

From what I’ve read AnchorUSD has only two employees which are the two CEOs of the company. It’s impossible to find any of their social medias or any useful information on them really. If you check their Twitter (which is the only social media platform they use) you can see they haven’t been active for months while people are begging for help. Some have been tweeting at them for MONTHS. At this point I’m convinced anyone who says they like AnchorUSD and haven’t experienced any problems with them are being paid to say so or something and the app is just a scam. I don’t know if those of us with money being held hostage by AnchorUSD need to get together and file a lawsuit or what but I’m not seeing enough people on here talking about this app screwing people over. I have over $4000 in my AnchorUSD account right now that they won’t let me move and it’s stressing me out immensely. That is a huge part of my life savings and it’s completely messed up that AnchorUSD is staying radio silent while holding people’s hard earned money.

I am going to contact the SEC and FBI about AnchorUSD like some others have, though I doubt they’ll do anything honestly. If anyone is going through similar issues with this company let’s try to come up with a solution to this!",1635176900,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfjndq/anyone_else_feeling_like_anchorusd_is_a_complete/

For example: I have telcoin (ETH token) on kucoin and I want to keep it long term but to transfer it to my hardware wallet.... the fees are insane. It is a 1000 telcoin. Might as well keep it on kucoin then. How do people go about it, I really don't know what to do because I do believe in the project and want to hold it long term. Is kucoin safe for long term?

42,CryptoCurrency,DeliciousAd3885,"Chainlink ($LINK) continue to deploy Oracle Systems, with most recent partnership being TradeStrike","TradeStrike is excited to announce that we have integrated Chainlink Price Feeds into our upcoming DEX platform; TradeStrike Lite — on BSC. Chainlink will feed decentralized data feeds into our DEX dashboard, giving users real-time, and industry-leading benchmarks on various crypto-assets in order to make informed trading decisions. Our initial integration involves price feeds for BNB, BTC, USDT, BUSD, and LINK — with the ability to easily scale up to more assets in the future.

The integration marks the beginning of an ongoing commitment to exclusively use Chainlink Price Feeds across ALL of our upcoming products. As a next step, we plan to integrate Chainlink Price Feeds directly in our TradeStrike Wallet.

We selected Chainlink because it’s the most time-tested price feed solution in the industry, already helping secure tens of billions of dollars in value for leading decentralized and centralized financial products. Chainlink Price Feeds offer premium data quality with wide market coverage, as well as robust oracle infrastructure that maintains high uptime and tamper-resistance. By incorporating decentralized infrastructure like Chainlink, TradeStrike is able to offer increased transparency and reliability into the data relied on by traders while still maintaining strong precision and low update latency.

While our DEX will facilitate price discovery through spot markets, it’s important for users to have reliable benchmarks on assets as aggregated from across all exchanges. This will allow users to make even more precise decisions when trading as they can compare TradeStrike’s native DEX prices against the broader market.
After reviewing various centralized and decentralized data solutions, we found 
Chainlink Price Feeds to offer a superior solution, which uniquely combined accuracy, transparency, and robustness. Some of the key features of Chainlink Price Feeds:

High-Quality Data — Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that’s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned from outliers and suspicious volumes. Chainlink’s data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are resistant to API downtime, flash crash outliers, and data manipulation attacks.

High Update Frequency — Chainlink Price Feeds on high-performance blockchains can perform frequent price updates at minimal costs, resulting in precise price data that consistently reflects current market conditions.
Robust Infrastructure — Chainlink Price Feeds utilize decentralized networks of professional node operators run by leading blockchain DevOps teams and traditional enterprises with a strong track record of uptime during market volatility.

Transparent Monitoring — Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical and real-time performance of price feeds.

I hope this post is not against certain guidelines and rules, I’m relatively new to the crypto market and just wanted to get an input from some of the more experienced people. 

I’ve recently got into a coin, which had at first glance, ample buy demand (thick buy wall) and relatively small sell wall. 

Got to admit got a bit of a FOMO at first and put in an order to a relatively high price. Bought it and was waiting for it to go up, which giving the relatively healthy buy order all, it did. 

Half a day later I began to notice that although ample volume of trading was being done, the price stayed barely above the price I bought it at and I would notice this glitch like in-and-out numbers in the order lists. I did some digging and learned about the whole spoofing phenomenon. Liceu and learn, right?

So my question to the more veteran traders here is - what is the best course of action when you see that the currency price is being spoofed for 2 days straight and the spoofing is done on both sides of the order book (on buy and sell)? Do you get out with the little gains or wait for the big play?

# What is it?

Theta represents a complex and extensive project associated with several purposes. The primary one, on which its business model is based, is about the structuring of a platform (precisely called Theta), able to offer video streaming services, exploiting the potential of the blockchain.  The streaming sector itself, as everyone knows, has been among the most developed markets over the last 5 years. The development of online platforms, centralized and headed by private organizations, has had the ability to revolutionize the world of visual entertainment.  In all this, Theta, through its technology, is trying to propose an alternative system, which we could define 4.0, completely decentralized, that is, based on the very presence of the network and on anyone willing to use the same services. Following are the main current issues that Theta is trying to solve:

* **Slow buffering**: centralized platforms, given the numerous overloads and considerable amounts of data, very often fail to offer clear and smooth resolutions and exposures. Theta aims to solve this through a process of sharing broadband power by interested users.
* **Lower costs**: centralized platforms, given the numerous costs to be incurred for infrastructures and so on, very often provide lower returns to content creators (the so-called streamers). The centralized nature of Theta aims to guarantee improvements also in this respect.
* **Rewards for everyone**: through the new generation Peer to Peer system, Theta aims to be able to offer to participants (i.e. those who make their power available to keep the system active) rewards in the form of tokens.

# How does it work?

The video streaming sector, having as its main object providing content with a significant ""weight"", is associated with an enormous exchange of data. This aspect represented one of the first problems to be solved by the foundation at the head of the project. A second relevant aspect, present in this case due to the process of distribution of bonuses to those who participate in the provision of resources to keep the system active, concerns the amount (millions) of micropayments. How has Theta solved these aspects, allowing to structure a system of sharing, obtaining bandwidth and distribution of rewards? Through its internal structures based on:  Internal Theta network with node links and Theta blockchain.

* **Theta network**: the fundamental pillar concerns the internal network. It is a singular network, similar to a mesh network, which allows fast communication  between the nodes inside.  In turn, the internal communications of the nodes allow on the one hand to allow the collective system for making the band available (by users who decide to accept the process) and on the other to guarantee the maintenance of shares and visuals.  In other words, a single user, wishing to benefit from the service, can make part of his power available, in order to collaborate in the creation of the network of nodes, receiving in exchange tokens. A simple system in its complexity, to allow cost reductions (linked to traditional systems) and high quality video, linked to the nodes
* **Theta blockchain**: the Theta blockchain has been specially structured to meet the needs set out above, one of which is the immense amount of data to be managed. One of the first solutions, in this case in association with the problem of creating and structuring micropayments, concerns the Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool system.  Through it, it is possible to take advantage of the formation of very small off-chain payments, in turn associated with a network of withdrawals. The same technology has now opened the doors to new projects, all focused on the world of digitized payments.  Beyond micropayments, moving to data processing, the Theta organization had to look for a system to greatly increase the scope and capacity of the ecosystem (in other words, to continuously generate and ensure high throughput). To do this, it uses a Multi Level BTF (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) mechanism and a multi-layer system.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for THETA are Theta Wallet, Trust Wallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Innovative project
2. Great devs team
3. Great and fast blockchain (Smart Contracts included)

7,CryptoCurrency,at--at--,[serious] What takes down ETH short term?,"And I don’t mean what coin … I mean what can happen to create its demise?

In my opinion, trying to predict any further out than this is more nebulous, but as I try to maintain a level head I would like to know peoples opinions on what can happen.

So much hopium everywhere that I want to know what you think the worst case scenario is for ETH. What can possibly happen to make it go to zero (or plummet) in the next 18-24 months?

I have considered economic problems, but the market doesn’t react that negatively during a market crash. It will just lose value and then come back.

I have considered governmental problems, but the decentralized nature of a theory means that it doesn’t matter what the government says necessarily. Again may cause a short term dip but would not mean the end of Ethereum.

I guess there could be a technical flaw in general Blockchain technology? At this point bitcoin has been around for long enough that it should have been hacked by now if it was going to be. The public ledger seems pretty damned unbeatable.

And without revealing my full position I will say that I am obviously invested in Ethereum. I am also extremely bullish on where I think Ethereum will go in the next 10 years. I want to test all of that and make sure I’m not being shortsighted about something important.

11,CryptoCurrency,MadEinsy,Reports saying that Indian government planning on making money from cryptocurrency trading by introducing tax regulations.

Crypto trading is likely to see a formal taxation structure as the Ministry of Finance has reportedly formed a committee to find out if income made by crypto-trading could be taxed.

Also, Classification of earnings from the crypto assets as business income or capital gains completely depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, said Singhania. If an individual is trading frequently in such assets or his livelihood is dependent on the income from trading in cryptocurrencies, then such earnings are classified as business income.

Keep in mind that Solana has recently crossed the 1000 node milestone, which is among the top in the world (obviously doesn’t compare to something like ETH but to be fair ETH is a blue chip and has like a 4 year head start).

22,CryptoCurrency,operator139,I have to live a secret life now. I want to share how important this is if you go down the path of being successful with Crypto.,"I bought the dip back several months ago, I put a lot of money in. I will not say how much but let's just say it was enough, and people who tell you you can get rich off of putting $100 in Shib, that's great and all, but you probably are going to have to start with more.

Anyway, I put a decent amount into Alts, lots into Ethereum, and Bitcoin. I then put my assets into some lending platforms and accrued interest.

Here we are months later, and I am doing so so well it's awesome. Yet, I cannot tell anyone. I am currently living in a house rented out by my family. I was already told my rent would be increased because I got excited and sent out a text the other day that Bitcoin hit an ATH.

 ""I heard you were talking about investing in Bitcoin, if you are doing so well, you should be paying the standard rent in your state then.""

I get it guys, I messed up here. I told them I actually hadn't since this was my one conversation about it and shut up quick.

On social media, because I posted a few things on Cryptocurrency videos, I get around 20 spam messages a day trying to scam me and had to create new accounts because I am so paranoid about my passwords.

In dating, I feel paranoid because I do not want any girl I date to know my bank account. I simply just keep it a secret and do not dare share my interest in Cryptocurrency. I think this is the best route for obvious reasons. 

I can't tell anyone about my luck. You can't go buy some nice sports car. Where did you get the money from? You have to keep it a complete secret otherwise people are going to be envious and want to take from you. I'm sorry but I can tell nobody wants to know my ""secret way"" I made  a 500% increase in a few months. You are much better off taking your profits out, putting them in stable coins and enjoying more steady profit once the bear market comes in secret. This isn't financial advice but I cannot see anyway I can use my profits in which won't cause some havoc in my life, people do not like if you succeed in a way they cannot or will not understand.

35,CryptoCurrency,sergelevrai5,Land stablecoin,"Hi everyone, so a thought occurred to me. We have $ backed stablecoin, gold and silver stablecoins on the way, but has anyone thought of creating a coin backed by actual real life land property?

The main advantage I see here is that land is actually of finite scarcity, on the contrary of $ (and gold on a smaller scale).

This is how I'm picturing it:
A fund buys a huge land property somewhere, for example 1M acres, and sells 1M token (1/acre) at double or triple the cost.
They have to sell it at a higher price, because the land needs investments in order to be managed in a sustainable and profitable way.

Then if you buy a token, part of this token represents the land and another part represents the capital linked to that land.

If the exploitation of the land earns money, it is added to the value
If the land value varies, it should also be reflected on the token price.

I feel this would be a safe haven in bear markets, plus it could be great for the planet's ecosystem if it's made properly, with a good governance system and sustainability as a core value.

If you want to trade i suggest only sell when you know your asset has pumped or take profits on the way up and when it drops significantly you buy back in.

Also remember when you do trade you need to keep track of your transactions for tax purposes it’s always safe to do bookkeeping.

Other than that if you take a look at previous bull runs and this one you can see just by holding even the low caps they slowly pull up as bitcoin goes sideways at times. These few months i think most things will move up regardless, it will take little % down but most will hold and move up as well. 

Try to put your money in solid projects and to be safe you can always take profits on the way up (that’s one of the hardest things to do).

60,CryptoCurrency,kirtash93,Cryptotrivial contest 2021: Round 33! When the majority of peers on the network are malicious and monopolize the network in order to prevent specific nodes from receiving information from honest nodes. | 25/10/2021,"Welcome to **Round 33 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 33: When the majority of peers on the network are malicious and monopolize the network in order to prevent specific nodes from receiving information from honest nodes. 

The correct answer of **Round 32** is...

# Bollinger Bands!

**What are Bollinger Bands:**

The Bollinger Bands, or BB, were developed in the 1980s by financial analyst and trader John Bollinger. Since then, many traders and chartists have been using the BB as a technical analysis (TA) indicator.In essence, the Bollinger Bands function as a measurement tool of market oscillations. As such, the BB indicator can be used to identify the moments that a particular market presents high or low volatility. Also, they can be useful for spotting potential overbought or oversold market conditions.

The BB indicator consists of two sidelong bands and a middle line. These three elements indicate how prices more around an average value, which is represented by the middle band. The upper and lower bands expand when market volatility is high, and contract when market volatility is low. They either move away from the middle band (high volatility) or towards it (low volatility).

The Bollinger Bands are among the most used TA indicators, especially in traditional financial markets. However, they are also used by cryptocurrency traders. Still, BB should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather in conjunction with other TA tools and indicators, to decrease the overall risks.

There are a few basic ways of reading and interpreting the information provided by the BB indicator. 

For instance, imagine that the price of an asset moves from below the middle line all the way up to the upper band, surpassing it. This would indicate a potential overbought condition. The same reading logic applies to the opposite side. If an asset’s price exceeds the lower band, it may be indicative of oversold conditions. The upper and lower bands may also suggest potential support and resistance levels, in which the price is likely to bounce.

Other than that, the movement of the upper and lower bands in relation to the middle line is a very important factor of the BB indicator. The expansion and contraction of the bands may come handy when traders and chartists are trying to predict the next periods of market volatility (or lack thereof). 

For example, if the volatility starts increasing, the bands will expand and move away from the middle line. In contrast, if the market volatility decreases, the bands will contract and move towards the middle.

First original post, so be nice!

I am new to the Crypto game.  I started out with the DOGE craze earlier this year and I have been fully sucked in. During this time I have noticed different communities nay saying and hating on each other.  Why is this? 

Do I hate that I missed out on some of the top gainers?  Yep, but I can't bring myself to hate the people that DID get in on it.  Good for them!  

Honestly, the closest other thing that I can think of to compare it to is Craps.  Everyone loves everyone when they are winning... But nobody hates the people around when they crap out, they are all in it together.  Hopefully for the better.

66,CryptoCurrency,ridnovir,Here is how SEC will determine which crypto will be subject to its regulation," I have been lurking on this board for a while and decided to contribute. I am taking SEC Reg class in law school now and want to share one very illuminating document. As most of you know SEC is the primary regulator of securities in the US and it will decide whether or not particular crypto is a security. Most of you may have heard of the so-called Howey test that SEC will employ to make this determination. However, the analysis that SEC will employ will go much deeper than that and will incorporate numerous important factors.

A body with SEC - the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub) coordinates the agency’s oversight and response regarding emerging technologies in financial, regulatory, and supervisory systems ie deals with crypto. FinHub serves as a public resource for information about the SEC’s views and actions related to FinTech innovation. Here is a link to the paper by FinHub that lays out the analytical framework of how SEC will evaluate if a cryptocurrency project is a security:

 [Here is the Document](https://www.sec.gov/files/dlt-framework.pdf)

I strongly recommend giving it a read and evaluating if your favorite projects could be deemed a security, based on that framework, BEFORE you invest.",1635173307,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfid59/here_is_how_sec_will_determine_which_crypto_will/

Multiple users tagged Guy, and he replied a few hours ago but I thought posting it would bring more awareness to his reasoning given that is answer was buried in the replies.

Here it is. [Link to Guy's response.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf3eqg/coin_bureau_is_a_brand_owned_and_operated_by_a/hhywt8f/)

&gt; Thanks for the tag. I don't know why this is a controversy, given that I answered most of it in a previous AMA here:

&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p2ytn0/guy_from_coin_bureau_here_ama/

&gt; I thought it was obvious that we were a team. You merely need to take a look through my instagram to see all the other people behind the scenes. We work hard every day and night to provide the most honest and trustworthy crypto education we can.

&gt; With regards to the founding of the Coin Bureau and its history, I answered it here:

&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p2ytn0/comment/h8nw6zj/

&gt; Yes, my friends started the Bureau and I decided to join them on the journey to grow the YouTube channel.

&gt; When it comes to the accusations of trying to ""manipulate your opinion"" or ""shill to the highest bidder"", I won't really dignify that with a response. Perhaps OP didn't see my Tweet from last week:

&gt; https://twitter.com/coinbureau/status/1451576240679395343?s=20

&gt; It's literally *pinned to my profile*.

&gt; As to how we make money, I also covered that in the AMA:

&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p2ytn0/comment/h8o25wm/

&gt; I have never *run a single ad* on YouTube. Here is a snapshot of our *lifetime* adsense account:

&gt; https://prnt.sc/1xa8atn

&gt; We don't do sponsored reviews and have a company policy against promoting any sort of leveraged trading. Every single product or service we talk about has to benefit our users first. And if my viewers don't want it, I'm totally cool with that.

&gt; Maybe they want to help out by buying a merch item, maybe they don’t. It’s entirely up to them and as long as they get something from the content we put out, I’m happy.

&gt; At the end of the day, we are here trying to give people the highest quality crypto content they can get. All that is free and I don’t place anything behind a paywall. There are other great YouTubers who do the same of course, who I have covered here:

&gt; But I can't focus too much on what others are doing because my efforts are better spent keeping the channel going and doing what I love.

&gt; I think that the success and growth of it is testament to the quality of that content, and the impartial way in which we approach it.

&gt; Now, with respect to OP. I gather that he/she is an Algo fan. About 2 weeks ago, I made a video on Algorand vs. Solana. There were two inaccuracies in the video. That was mainly as a result of timing on the release of Algorand's announcement of the ending of accelerated vesting. It happened the day when the video was scheduled and we didn't pick it up.

&gt; However, after realising the error, I immediately started work on a new video that looked at the Algorand ecosystem and explained in the beginning that I was mistaken. I am happy to admit to mistakes when I make them - I’m only human, after all.",1635173204,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfibty/guy_from_coinbureau_answers_yesterdays_post/

  Been keeping an eye on BTC lately, have done some analyses on it in the past weeks and now I have identified a different movement happening. This region is losing volume too fast and the players are not changing their position lately, this is dangerous because if a strong enough player acts it can drop the price suddenly! Check the graph:

[BTC has lost 60&amp;#37; of its volume since 21 of October and is back at 63K region, strong pressure region.](https://preview.redd.it/l6uwccdcwlv71.png?width=2557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=136dc35515f4043d06068e06282852c5cd016021)

  As we can see this is a strong pressure region, acting more as a resistance, and the players are fighting around it. The MACD is stable showing that the buyers are not droping their position and the sellers have not yet attacked heavy the position, except for the 21 of Oct that sent the price back to 60K.

  
  T**he volume is dropping hard last days**, and that is the reason for this analysis, this region is a Pressure Region where big players tend to act heavy and the movements can swing fast, the coin has **lost 60% of its volume** since 21 of Oct and now is prone to Flash Crashes. Any whale can move the price easily now, any news can trigger a heavy movement.

  I have identified the region of 59K as a probably region to be hit by strong swing movements in price, those who are trading can put orders there in hopes to get a lucky movement, specially now that the price has hit 63K again. Its not a conventional trading strategy, more like a lucky shot to get 7% quickly if it happens. We are seeing many news of people getting great prices out off the price reach and is because of this low volume and players holding their region, any strong aggression can drive the price up or down fast. I wound't short this coin but don't FOMO if it hits 67K again, it can be one of these movements, be aware!

  What do you guys think about this region? is BTC getting enough momentum to break 63K for good?

The pseudonymous analyst known as Inmortal tells his 92,000 Twitter followers that despite Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent correction from its all-time high of $67,276.79, he’s still not eager to buy dips in the king crypto.

According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s correction could take several weeks, all while other coins make new price spikes.

“BTC/USD

Price is below [the] old demand zone and currently testing weekly open as resistance.

If we go lower, the next interest area is $58,000 (untaken lows and KEY lvl), maybe a good spot to long, depends on the reaction.

Why I’m not buying dips aggressively? because I think BTC may consolidate below all-time high for a bit, then altcoin run, and weeks later another leg up for BTC. These are just my personal thoughts.

In any case, if BTC finds acceptance above $62,000 (weekly open and old demand) I think we could see a move up to $67,000.”

Inmortal has previously predicted that Ethereum will break out of an ascending channel en route to $6,300 by mid-November. 

According to Inmortal, the Ethereum rally will trigger other altcoins to follow suit.

It doesn't apply to you and it most likely never will. It probably doesn't apply to anyone frequenting this sub. And if it does apply to you (now, or ever) then congratulations, you've made it.

Facts:  
1. This is a proposal. And it probably will not pass the House AND the Senate anyways.  
2. Like I said above, wealth taxes won't and probably will never apply to you. And if you're in a situation where it does apply to you: congratulations, you're rich as fuck.  
3. You should HOPE that congress gets their shit together enough to actually tax the wealthy in a meaningful way. The reason you and I have to pay the amount of taxes that we do, is because the super-rich don't.   
4. Up until the mid-1980s, the highest tax bracket was 50%, 70%, even 91% at its peak. We are currently at 37% whether you make $1M or $100M. Back then we actually had money for infrastructure, SSI, safety nets, etc. The rich are no longer paying their fair share, and you should welcome any attempt to make them do so.

Historically HODL does seem like a very good strategy, but sometimes life events take over and it isn't always possible for humans to act in rational ways. For example at one point I was $130K up - but then there was a crash and I bailed at $84K. But I would like to know if I had had a bot with some sensible rules trading for me, would I have come out of the deal better than by just relying on my own judgement? In other words, what is the evidence if there is any, that bots can be more successful than humans in trading cryptocurrencies? Also what given the available evidence, if any could be considered the most successful bot trading strategy - and is there any evidence that it can outperform HODL?",1635172397,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfi1oo/what_is_really_the_best_cryptocurrency_trading/

17,CryptoCurrency,michaeljpec,A look into two small cap coins to better prepare you for altcoin season: ACH and NKN,"The first one we’ll look at is **ACH: Alchemy Pay**.

* Current price seems to have found a home around $0.06 
* Current mc is $187M with a fully diluted mc of about $590M
* Coinbase listing
* They're a Singapore based crypto-fiat payment system similar to AMP (not a direct 1:1 comparison, as AMP is primarily collateral-fiat)
* Two big Q4 catalysts coming. One being a Binance listing (Binance is already currently a partner to Alchemy), the other being the launch of cytoplink cards with partnerships by VISA and Mastercard
* Building a payment bridge between crypto and fiat through binance Pay wallet, giving ACH holders access to Binance's huge base to send and receive global payments with over 40 different tokens, similar to Strike

The second one we’ll look at is **NKN**

* Currently sitting around $0.40
* About a $308M mc, fully diluted mc is under $500M
* No big vc firms behind it yet, giving higher potential gains to early investors
* If you watched Silicon Valley on HBO, NKN is basically a real-life Pied Piper
* If they can accomplish what they're after, it can be HUGE for NKN and the world, essentially allowing users to be their own telecom network
* Similar idea to a Helium network (but again, not a 1:1 comparison)
* Founder is Yanbo Li  who wrote core backbone for many projects (Zilliqa, Neo) and has a strong developer reputation, teamed up with Whitfield Diffie who is a cryptographer and pioneer of public-keys (winner of Turing award in 2015)

27,CryptoCurrency,alexb_090,Bitcoin halving cycles and why they mean less and less.,"As every crypto vet knows, the long term price action of crypto, and BTC in particular, has historically been controlled by the BTC halving cycle. For anyone who doesn't know, Bitcoin has a set reward paid out the successful miner of each block. 1 BTC block is mined approximately every 10 minutes. Originally, this reward was 50 BTC. However, every 120k blocks, or about every 4 years, the reward is halved. There have been 3 halvings so far, as can be seen in [this chart](https://masterthecrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoin-halving-price-usd-exchange-rate-values.jpg). Currently, the block reward is 6.25 BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to note about the chart is that shortly before a halving and then for a long time after, there has consistently been a huge bull market, followed by a bear market, and then a consolidation and accumulation period before the next halving and bull market. Again, every vet should recognize this, but many newbies won't. Although no one is completely sure, these halvings are believed to impact the price of BTC in this way due to the laws of supply and demand. During a halving event, the inflation rate dramatically shrinks and the miners (who presumably own a large percentage of the supply) have a shift in their economic incentives due to the anticipation of smaller supply.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as you can also see in the chart linked above, each consecutive bull market has been longer and caused a smaller rise in price. This is because each halving has less of an effect on the price. [Here](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/VIQLRRLMWZCNXLSAI6AOWE4N4A.png) is a chart showing the total supply and block rewards over time. In the first halving in 2012, with a supply of around 10.5 million BTC, the block reward dropped from 50 to 25 resulting in a daily supply growth change from 7200 BTC to 3600 BTC or a yearly inflation rate drop from 25% to 12.5% overnight. This inflation change is clearly hugely significant. However, the next inflation drop was less significant, from  8.2% to 4.1%, with the most recent one being less significant than that, from 3.5% to 1.75%.

&amp;#x200B;

The lessening impact of these inflation adjustments during halvings combined with the trend of crypto whales being more institutional investors and less miners has been and will continue to lead to the end of BTC cycles. The one we are currently experiencing has already bounced some previous trends with this double peak, and although I am still expecting a dip soon, it will probably be the last clear cycle with an obviously parabolic bull market and a long, cold winter after.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of what you should take away from this, you should realize that we aren't early anymore. The market is on its way to stabilizing, and although the ordinary American still isn't invested, all the institutions are at least exposed in some way. However, this is still bullish. Stability is attractive and leads to mass adoption, and big gains can still come from new altcoins because although the market is no longer new, much of the tech is. It also means that if/when the next crypto dip comes, it may be your last chance to load up on the big boys at a ""low"" price. I know this has been kind of a wall of text, but I hope it helps someone.",1635172123,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfhy9z/bitcoin_halving_cycles_and_why_they_mean_less_and/

I spoke with my girlfriend and got her interested in the crypto currency world... but she prefers to enter slowly in the market, still on the idea that slow but steady gains are better than ""bets"" on what is rampaing the market in the present moment. She saw the credit card offered by staking coins on [crypto com](https://crypto.com), and the 2% cashback one (the ruby card) seems to be perfect, both for the bonus and the initial price of 350 Euro.  


Problem is I can't find any information about the staking APY on these CRO coins anywhere on the site (and also on the mobile app).   
Saw yesterday someone in a different forum outiside Reddit saying there's a 14% APY of interest, but maybe it's a bit irrealistic... I don't believe it much, and it was a guy alone telling this without other confirmations.

I did not understand impermanent loss before i put it most of my spot balances into Liquid Swap to earn interest, as apposed to hodeling thru the recent price crash. 

I can now see that the my coins are getting weighed towards the less profitable ones. Eg, 

  **2021-09-25** \- LTC/BTC - Added Liquidity            - 1.1065 LTC + 0.0040 BTC - **341.1722 USD** 

but today, while reviewing it shows current standing as:

   **2021-10-25** \- LTC/BTC - Current Composition - 1.1939 LTC + 0.0037 BTC  -  **467.6662 USD**

So even thought the total value has gone up from 341USD  to 467USD as price has increased (mainly for BTC), it would have been higher if I had never added to liquidity. 

NOW, I am truly appreciating impermanent loss, which is actually permanent loss as my LTC holding has increased and BTC reduced. It basically seems that added liquidity will always shift towards lesser performing coin and may come back if that other coin starts going up compared to its pair.

**TL;DR;** I added to Liquidity Swap in Binance Liquidity swap without properly understanding impermanent loss. Now I have more of low performing coins and less of high performing coins. I am about to remove all funds from liquidity and looking for any advise.

[Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) is making it easier for banks to offer cryptocurrency rewards on their credit and debit cards as part of the payment network’s recent embrace of digital currencies. 

To pull it off, Mastercard has inked a deal with [Bakkt](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BKKT:US), the cryptocurrencies firm that spun off from Intercontinental Exchange earlier this year, according to a [statement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R1JC60MEQTXF) Monday. As part of the changes, Mastercard will also make it easier for consumers to spend the cryptocurrency rewards they earn at the millions of retailers on the firm’s network. 

“Together with Bakkt and grounded by our principled approach to innovation, we’ll not only empower our partners to offer a dynamic mix of digital assets options, but also deliver differentiated and relevant consumer experiences,” Sherri Haymond, executive vice president of digital partnerships at Mastercard, said in the statement. 

CNBC reported the partnership earlier Monday. Bakkt shares surged 40% to $12.78 at 9:33 a.m. in New York. Mastercard shares climbed 1.2%. 

Mastercard said earlier this year it would begin allowing cardholders to transact in certain cryptocurrencies on its network. In July, the payments giant said it would work with startups focused on crypto and digital assets as part of its push to make it easier for consumers to buy, spend and hold cryptocurrencies.

We've all entered Crypto for different reasons, we have different goals &amp; we obviously all want to make some money out of our investment, but at what cost?

Between launch in August 2020 &amp; the new ATH yesterday, SHIB is up by **4 418 400%. That's how much you would have if you've invested 100$ back then.**

For those who are just there for the money, it simply means you would had done insanely better if this year you'd yoloed only in this token instead of any other coin including BTC &amp; ETH.

More importantly, the fact that Shib (#13) surpasses by a lot in market cap coins like Monero (#38), Litecoin (#17), Alrogand (#20), etc. proves that having unique features or trying to be innovative/competitive is pointless. And once again, **All that matters is hype.** 

The most used sentence I've seen in this sub since SHIB new ATH is **""The market is irrational""**. But doesn't it send the wrong message that you've better time investing in shady hype coins instead of promising coins that don't seem to be going anywhere? *Nano is still outside the Top 100 (#117)*

And in terms of adoption by the mainstream, I wouldn't be surprised to see soon the old turtles in politics or family members to use this coin to make the whole Cryptocurrency concept look like a joke.

Still, Shib like Doge are exceptions to the rule since others hype coins don't survive after launch being dumped as soon as it pumped.

But what's next, is the future gonna be more &amp; more hype coins that will be looking for a wealthy guardian guaranteeing them a safety net while serious projects/coins will only go lower &amp; lower? *Ironically, today a Shib holder shot itself in the foot by asking Elon how many Shib coins he owns.

85,CryptoCurrency,thirdworlddude,Around May 2019 I bought 13 random ALTcoins. Here is how much they are worth today.,"Around May 2019, I spent AUD 1300 to buy 13 random Altcoins. I remember buying **33.74 BNB** first with the money. I bought 13 coins assigning a certain amount to each one of them. I picked the coins randomly. Most of them were pumped here in the last bull run. They still existed so I bought them because I was familiar with their name. I didn't do any further research. I know it was not a good strategy but I took the risk.

Here is my calculations and how much my portfolio is worth today.

&amp;#x200B;

|Coin|Quantity|Total Cost (AUD)|Worth Today (AUD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Siacoin|20000|100|500|
|Icon|171.3|100|482|
|MIOTA|168.9|100|299|
|ARK|113.5|100|303|
|PPT|67.51|100|67|
|SKYCOIN|49.09|100|80|
|NANO|37.59|100|271|
|OMG|33|100|636|
|NEO|0.8|14.22|47|
|ZEC|1|100|231|
|BNB|1.2|50|775|
|WXT|18153|200|144|
|FTM|2736.78|135.78|10948|
|||1300 AUD|14783 AUD|

I remember reading here that buying BTC wouldn't be worth it because someone commented something along the lines of, ""Meh, how much will BTC go up by now, it's already worth so much."" So, I showed less interest in BTC.

If I had spent the entire money (1300 AUD) on Bitcoin, I would have approximately 0.154 BTC which would be worth 12,975 AUD approx today. BTC was around 7K USD and 9K AUD back then.

If I had spent the entire money on ETH I would have 21500 AUD worth of Ethereum.

Had I not exchanged my 33.74 BNB to these Alts, it would be worth **21,854 AUD** today.

I got lucky with the last coin FTM which covered a good portion of my BNB opportunity costs. I bought it by mistake thinking that I was buying Feathercoin about which I heard in a movie.

There were a lot of ups and downs from back then to today. I remember thinking I should have bought a Macbook instead because I had a shitty laptop which I'm using to type this today as well.

Anyways, the lesson I learned was not to invest randomly because you might not always get lucky. Invest in good projects instead. I am not giving any financial advice, I'm just sharing what gets shared here often, like posts about how people invest in the top 10 coins and share their progress after a certain time.

Numbers: Shiba Inu’s price reached $0.000044, which is an increase of 39,000,000% in the past year.

Background: Shiba Inu is known as the Dogecoin killer and is now seen as the dominant meme coin in the market.

Catalyst: The price of Shiba Inu increased Sunday due largely to a tweet that suggested that Robinhood (Nasdaq: HOOD) might list the crypto on its platform soon. There is already a petition with over 300,000 signatures from people asking Robinhood to list the coin.

Bigger Picture: Most other cryptos have also seen their prices increase recently.

Final Thoughts: Shiba Inu is not the safest investment and carries a degree of risk.

4,CryptoCurrency,TheBlueMango01,Unpopular Opinion: The current economic situation will screw cryptocurrencies really hard in the winter.,"TLDR: inflation and energy costs are going to hurt crypto mining and households will probably lack liquidity, so we might look at a potential sell-off in the winter, before we finally finish this cycle next year.

&amp;#x200B;

I am overall seeing a fairly positive outlook for crypto in the next few months, but while I think November should be a great month for crypto, I think there is cause for concern for the upcoming winter. I'm not here to spread FUD, just trying to remain level headed and realistic, and that's why I've added in my sources. Please do comment below your opinion on this.

I think before I give a bit of a road map for where I think bitcoin is headed, let's review the current economic situation.

**Inflation:**

Inflation has already been drastically increasing in the west especially with the current limitations of the supply chains, and the quantitative easing due to corona. More money being thrown in, means higher demand, and therefore prices and add on top what is now being termed: ""the great resignation"", where in September alone more that 4.3 Americans resigned from their jobs, you get inflation, leading to companies working understaffed, you get inflation.

\[increased demand leads to shortages - The Economist\]([https://www-economist-com.esc-web.lib.cbs.dk:8443/leaders/2021/10/09/the-world-economys-shortage-problem](https://www-economist-com.esc-web.lib.cbs.dk:8443/leaders/2021/10/09/the-world-economys-shortage-problem))

**Rising energy prices:**

Energy. Today we are reliant on electricity for everything we do. From mining bitcoin to calling your loved one, to working. However last year's very cold winter, and the COVID pandemic meant that a lot of the energy companies used up their stocks of oil, gas and coal, and most importantly DID NOT REPLENISH THEM THIS PAST YEAR DUE TO LACK OF INVESTMENT UNDER COVID. This means today we are faced with a situation, where with the economy kickstarting back to life, the demand for electricity and energy products in general is soaring but the supply cannot follow. This means higher energy prices, which will not get any better in the winter due to even higher demands. In an other situation, local governments could forcibly cut the electricity at some points during the day or to specific less ""economically valuable"" sectors.

\[Hidden Bitcoin Risk?\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rex-h4vkELs&amp;ab\_channel=CoinBureau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rex-h4vkELs&amp;ab_channel=CoinBureau))

**How does this affect crypto?**

Boy oh boy, in so many ways... First and foremost, let's talk mining. Please bear in mind I am no expert on this matter, and if someone wants to complement what i say in the comments, please do feel free! Anyway, mining today requires of course energy to find that famous 60 digit (?) number needed to mine a block. With energy prices soaring, this could lead to a lot of companies first and foremost stopping mining bitcoin because it isn't profitable anymore, or even forcibly being cut off from electricity due to the lack of ""economic value"" that is perceived to be created from bitcoin. This will drop the hash rate, and make processing transactions slower, probably deterring new investors from coming in. Then with the situation of inflation and the energy crisis, well, it will probably lead to households lacking liquidity in the short term until the government can put in place some contractionary policies, and until the winter is over, and thus the demand for energy products lowers. Needing more liquidity, will mean taking money out of investments, crypto will inevitably be included.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing this, we have to turn to some bitcoin analysis because anyway we know that it will dictate what the asset class does. There are different theories as of now on the direction for bitcoin in the upcoming few months, but the main theory is that the market cycle is not in. Moreover, some analysts have noticed the similarities between the 2013-14 market cycle and the current one. But basically the general consensus seems to be a double peak cycle like the aforementioned one. The key difference in consensus is for example CryptoCrewUniversity  saying the market cycle top could come this upcoming month, and Benjamin Cowen talking about a much longer market cycle that could extend into next year.

\[Bitcoin price prediction - CryptoCrewUniversity\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wECZvQ5twzc&amp;t=3s&amp;ab\_channel=CryptoCrewUniversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wECZvQ5twzc&amp;t=3s&amp;ab_channel=CryptoCrewUniversity))

I would like to therefore propose a theory that would take into consideration all of the aforementioned information and merge it into one.

Bitcoin price over the next few months would look something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[\*\*POTENTIAL\*\* Bitcoin price action in the next 9 months](https://preview.redd.it/lgar0l6lnlv71.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e62c237ae5990f955dc6bc2957b45aafe97d2f88)

I would like to propose the triple cycle top theory. Let me explain it.

First and foremost, we take from CryptoCrewUniversity's theory that the market cycle top is going to come in in November, however, I will argue that we will get rejected before reaching it by the same bitcoin logarithmic growth band as in April this year (which would then be at 100k, a level which anyway could provide resistance since it is a massive milestone). This would be the second peak. Such a rejection would also be fuelled by the inflation and the energy crisis that is inevitable, and could cause a drop until basically 40k in my opinion. This level would correlate with both the logarithmic band that held as support in July and is the level we held support at in September before we went on the current move to 69k (nice.) . Anyway that would probably mean that in early March the situation might slowly start to clear up with lower demand for energy coming out of the winter and the governments finding solutions to the inflation. We could then finally do another repeat of the move in august to now, with the same move to the middle log band, down to the bull market support band, and then finally the final rally to 150k and above, being the third and final peak, which could correlate then with the longer market cycle theory put forward by Benjamin Cowen.

Of course I'm obviously an ape who doesn't know shit about fuck so please don't take this for God's word, I'm just trying to come up with a reasonable prediction for shits and giggles. Of course this is only for educational purposes and not financial advice. Please write down why I may be wrong.

Some of the major outlines of this project will be -
1. Provide donations/charity to local community programs where we can supply food and host pop up kitchens to provide food to the people in need. 
2. Help aspiring cooks, pastry chefs, sommeliers, to get scholarships for ACF certifications and som certifications. 
3. Help burnt out Restaurnt workers by providing them services such as addiction help centers, consulting services, counseling services. 
4. Provide a NFT  platform where stunning dishes are minted into NFT’s and auctioned. 
5. Help sustainable farming and help get local farms the platform they need to succeed. 
6. Give back to local restaurants(non corporate institutions) 
7. Open canna-cuisine restaurants as the world adapts the concept. 
8. Become a versatile defi  payment solution program for the food service industry 
9. Provide blockchain wise logistic solutions for the food service community.

55,CryptoCurrency,WorkerBee-3,The US Constitution is a Decentralized structure. (And political parties are ruining it),"#The written Constitution itself, along with the Amendments, is the distributed ledger. And Congress, along with the President, is suppose to be the way we all come to consensus. 

How does this work? 

Well in America the 3 branches of government; Legislative, Executive, and Judicial are all supposed to be separated in efforts to point the power towards the people. 

How do the people get power under this constructed system? 

Well, it comes down to how we vote. 

Take political parties out of the equation and follow how the system was written. 

#Article 1: Congress. House of Representatives &amp; the Senate. 

In the constitution each and every State gets their equal representation by having 2 Senetors each as well as a population sized amount of House members. 

Based on general living conditions each state should be electing officials who represent the state's environment. Officials who know what it's like to live in dessert, mountains, the plains, off the ocean, surrounded by lakes, or even swamp/marshy land. And they not only would know what it's like to live in these areas but they should know what laws are best needed for these areas and what laws would hurt those who live in these areas. 

So you get 2 Senetors from each environment and a population sized House members from each environment. Chosen by the people who live in those environments. 

Clear distributed representation from across the entire country. 

#Article 2: The Executive Branch. 

The executive branch, referring to the President and his team of operations, is elected by the country as a whole. All environment landscapes and life styles, city/non-city, vote and the best outcome is suppose to be someone who represents what unifying perspectives are needed across each and every single environment to the best of a full countries abilities to vote. 

If any State feels the President doesn't represent them, well power is split between the branches and they still hold members who represent them in the Legislative Branch which is designed to keep the power of the Executive branch in check. By design, Their Representatives can still tell the President when he's not fulfilling the needs of the full country. 

#Article 3: The Judicial Branch 

How is this branch elected? Well this branch has members who are nominated by the Executive branch (as a country, we pick the person who picks these people) and then those nominations are voted on and approved by the Congress (as individual States, we pick the people who approve these nominations) 

Those who get nominated by the country's thinking (because the president is suppose to represent our thinking as a whole) and then approved by the States thinking (because Congress members are suppose to represent each State's way of thinking) are then in charge of making sure we all follow the rules written up by our voted members of Government. Not only are they in charge of that but they are in charge of reading the Constitution and making sure that the voters/citizens don't have any of their inalienable rights infringed upon during the law making consensus. (Our soul rights of; Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness) 

The Judicial branch is designed to keep both the 1st and 2nd branches of government in check so that they don't infringe on the voters rights. They are our final form of protection. 

This is a 200 year old decentralized structure. And this is how consensus was reached before computers.


#This is how the system is designed. 

Political parties are not apart of that original structure and actually compromise the separation between the branches of government. We no longer have 3 separated branches of government because we have both Republicans all across each branch and Democrats all across each branch. 

If you know anything about mining Bitcoin, you would know it is designed in a way that is decentralized. Meaning no one entity controls Bitcoin. It reaches consensus by the globe as a whole. But there is this point of failure called the 51% attack. Because of the price of Bitcoin, the only realistic way for this to happen would be from large mining pools where people join a group to mine and distribute the rewards across the pool when blocks are mined. 

Mining pools = Political Parties (voting pools) 

Political parties are where people join together in big groups to win the seats and then distribute the ""rewards"" (of being able to write laws) across each and every member of that pool. 

The problem with voting pools is they can cause the same 51% attack to the Decentralized Constitution as mining pools can cause to Decentralized Bitcoin. 

Having one pool in all 3 branches of government means there is no longer a separate of power between these branches and that means that the voters no longer have power. The system is compromised. 

The fact that 2 pools are saturated across the 3 branches of Government, and both parties spend a lot of time attacking each other, this country is constantly under a 51% attack.

63,CryptoCurrency,InvMiqx,"Proof of Stake, and some thoughts about the longevity of Cryptocurrencies","When I see people debating between cryptocurrencies and fiat money, I'll hear them mention decentralization, anonymity, low fees, etc. I almost never see discussion about what, in my opinion, truly makes cryptocurrencies special.

Cryptocurrencies are community-driven and open-source. Anyone can innovate upon cryptocurrencies, while comparatively, it is almost impossible for just anyone to innovate upon fiat currencies. 

If you weren't previously aware, Ethereum is moving from proof-of-stake to proof-of-work. This will entail massive changes. 

[\[news link\]](https://theconversation.com/ethereum-the-transformation-that-could-see-it-overtake-bitcoin-170316) [\[news link\]](https://blockonomi.com/ethereum-2-0-moves-closer/)

I have seen endless debate regarding this change. But one thing I think that people are missing is that this is innovation. Yes, billions of dollars in asset value are on the line. Regardless of the financial outcome, the community will learn something from this transition, and we'll make future innovations having learned from its successes or its failures.  

Sometimes, innovation takes risk-taking. Investing in Ethereum is by in part investing in the community's ability to innovation. I'm more than okay with this.

The move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake is an embodiment of community innovation. Needless to say, i'm pretty hype",1635168365,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfgpn6/proof_of_stake_and_some_thoughts_about_the/

74,CryptoCurrency,LeBateleur1,Is crypto good Christmas gift? Hell yeah.,"I read somewhere in this subreddit that a lot of people might cash out for buying Christmas gifts and this could be one of the starters of the next bear market. A little exaggerated, right? And seeing all the attention it has gained lately –and all those ATMs– I think crypto is gonna be a popular gift this Christmas season. It’s like getting money from gramma, but better than money. And if you’re the giver, you’re definitely not gonna look like a gramma.

This year there is an announced supply chain shortage, added to a shipping crisis which might leave a lot of people with their hands empty in the very last minute. So imagine you slept on and forgot to buy some important gifts… It is December 15 and probability is you won’t be able to get them on time. What do you do? Reach for your wallet.

If this happens, not only will people not cash out (just pass on their coins) but there might also be a nice inflow to the crypto market, which might push our expectations of a bear market from December further to January. And yet another reason is that a workers in many countries get an additional paycheck in the end of the year which I would be willing to spend on nothing else but coins sweet coins.

Am I too addicted or is it really a nice gift? I mean, not for kids of course, but for young adults or older people (mom and dad in my case). 

But I wonder what the best wrap is? I mean, if someone doesn’t have a wallet, can you just give them one with the keys? But then you’ll know the keys! Is it worth getting a physical wallet? Is it better to give a folder with instructions on how to receive your gift? Is it elegant to gift 0,005 of something?

*Processing img qxneugzuhlv71...*

***Full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9)***.***

January 1st, 2021, I bought $100 of following and turned it into a homemade crypto index fund: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Binance Coin,** and **Chainlink.** Below is the ninth monthly update on the progress of the 2021 Experiment.

***tl;dr:***

* **What's this all about?** Back in January 2018, I made a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven't sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment 2019, 2020, and 2021 because I'm a glutton for punishment and to show different entry points. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **SEP Winner** \- All-red month. Stablecoin **USDT** remained, um, stable, and **DOT** only fell -2%.
* **Overall since Jan. 2021** \- **ADA** in lead followed closely by **BNB. 100%**  of cryptos in green, **LTC** last place in 2021
* **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 405%.**

## Month Nine – UP 333%

*Processing img 66veem3qilv71...*

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB,** and **LINK**.  

September highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* Following its first all green month since [February 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2), the portfolio finished the month 100% in the red
* **ADA** retains the lead, but second place **BNB** makes up ground in September.

## September Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

Surprisingly, there wasn’t much movement this month with the 2021 Top Ten:

Downs:

* **Bitcoin Cash** – down 4 places (#14–&gt;#18)
* **Chainlink** – down 3 places (#12–&gt;#15)

*Processing img ij8g140tilv71...*

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**  Nine months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, three cryptos have dropped out: **Chainlink, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash.**  They have been replaced by **SOL**, **DOGE,** and **USDC**.

## September Winners and Losers

***September Winners*** –  Besides **Tether**, **DOT** had the least bad month, finishing September down only -2%.

***September Losers*** –  All coins were in the red, but **ADA** had the worst month, losing -26%.

**Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers**

Nine months into the Experiment, here’s where we stand in terms of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio’s monthly winners and losers: 

*Processing img qqv3fd8uilv71...*

**ADA** is in the lead with three monthly victories.  **ADA** is also tied with **UST** for most losses.  Swing trade anyone?

## Overall Update – ADA in front, BNB in second place, all cryptos in green.

Despite a tough September, **Cardano** has managed to maintain its lead over **Binance Coin**, preventing yet another flip for first place.  Both cryptos have had a very strong 2021 up +1,144 and +976% respectively.

The $100 investment into first place **ADA** nine months ago is now worth **$1,243.**

Besides **Tether**, **Litecoin** is the worst performing cryptocurrency of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio, up only **+29%** in 2021. 

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

The total crypto market lost about $108B in September, settling at just over $2.1T.  As a sector, crypto is up **+173%** in the nine month lifespan of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment. 

You may notice that the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is returning a little over double the overall crypto market cap (+333% vs. +173%) so far in 2021.  

This is a bit of an outlier: the rest of the [Top Ten Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) are well behind what the overall market has returned in their respective time frames.  Although the 2021 Top Ten approach has held up quite well compared to the overall market so far, I expect to see it fall behind eventually, like the other experiments.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$775B in January 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.22T** [**last month**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8).

## Bitcoin Dominance:

*Processing img ypp5luqvilv71...*

**BitDom** bounced slightly in September, up to 43.2% compared to 42% in August.  This is still at the low end of the range when looking at the 2021 timeframe as a whole. 

BitDom Low Point in the 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**41.9% in May 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5/).

BitDom High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in  January 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021:

*Processing img 8qiyl9ywilv71...*

The 2021 Portfolio lost nearly $894 in August.  Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +333%, the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2021 worth **$4,330**. 

Here’s the month by month ROI of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

*Processing img 358kb42yilv71...*

The 2021 Top Ten Portfolio has had the best start, by far, of any of the four [Top Ten Crypto Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).  

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

As most readers are aware, this is the fourth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, [at the height of the last crypto bull run](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  Where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +46% (total value $1,460)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33): up +510% (total value $6,098)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21): up +731% (total value $8,309)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9): up +333% (total value $4,330)

Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,197** ($1,460 + $6,098 + $8,309 + $4,330).

**That’s up +405%** when you put all four Top Tens together.

Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

*Processing img gqqp5ll1jlv71...*

***That’s a +405% gain by investing $1k into the cryptos that happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.***

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. For the first time in nearly a year, the S&amp;P 500 did not reach another month end all time high in September:

*Processing img mz2wxer6jlv71...*

The S&amp;P 500 Index is up **16%** in 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto nine months ago would be worth **$1,160** had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+333%** over the same time period – the initial $1k investment in crypto nine months ago is now worth **$4,330**.

That’s a difference of **$3,170** on a $1k investment in nine months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,630 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,740 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,350 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,160 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,880** ($1,630 + $1,740 + $1,350 + $1,160)

That’s up **+47%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+405%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 358% ***in favor of crypto.***

To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined four year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;P up to this point.

*Processing img xwtbhzp9jlv71...*

## Conclusion:

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+333%** since the beginning of the year and the only Top Ten Portfolio to outperform the overall market.  Q3 is historically a down month for crypto – how high can this portfolio reach by the end of the year?

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride!  Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.

86,CryptoCurrency,RefugeeDutch_Syrian,Shiba Inu stock price drops after Elon Musk denies owning SHIB,"The price of 'meme cryptocurrency' shiba inu (SHIB) soared again this weekend. The SHIB price jumped from $0.00002875 on Saturday to a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.00004432 on Sunday. It was an increase of a whopping 54% in 24 hours.

That rise was accompanied by Elon Musk tweeting about dogecoin (DOGE) again. Dogecoin already rose several times this year unprecedentedly hard after Musk's tweets and this time the DOGE and SHIB prices got another boost from Musk. SHIB also rose hard early this month after a tweet from Musk.

However, then the billionaire threw a spanner in the works for SHIB fans. He made it clear last night, around the time the SHIB price peaked, that he is a dogecoin fan and not a shiba inu fan. He denied that he owns SHIB at all:

Then the SHIB price plunged sharply to $0.00003542, down 20%. The huge volume that coincided with SHIB's rise then partially spilled over to dogecoin, which then rose briefly. The Tesla CEO then reported that the only crypto he owns are bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH) and dogecoin:

92,CryptoCurrency,RefugeeDutch_Syrian,"German-American billionaire, Peter Thiel, regrets not buying more bitcoin earlier, he is one of us","Do you feel you have enough bitcoin? Probably not. In this respect, we normal earthlings are no different from the billionaires of this world.

Entrepreneur, investor and billionaire Peter Thiel indicates to Bloomberg that he should have bought more bitcoin. It's a feeling we all know when bitcoin sets new price records after a relatively weak period.

&amp;#x200B;

Thiel [spoke about bitcoin](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/thiel-says-he-was-underinvested-in-bitcoin-price-may-rise), central banks and artificial intelligence during an event organized by Lincoln Network in Miami. In particular, the policies of central banks around the world had to take umbrage. ""You should just buy bitcoin alone,"" he joked to the audience in Miami. In which he winked at bitcoin maximalists who generally have their entire wealth in bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why did Thiel hesitate to buy more bitcoin?**

***The only thing Peter Thiel currently seems to regret is not buying more bitcoin earlier***. ""I feel like I haven't invested enough in bitcoin,"" the billionaire said. The reason he did not invest more is because he had the belief that ""the secret"" was already known to everyone. By which he means that he thought everyone with a little money had long understood bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

The current price explosion proves otherwise and Peter Thiel sees that too. ""I think more buying is still the best strategy. Maybe it's still enough of a secret,"" Thiel continued. The co-founder of PayPal seems almost unable to believe that not everyone has already figured out the value of bitcoin in the current macroeconomic climate.

&amp;#x200B;

Known as a libertarian, Thiel sees the rise of bitcoin as the world's answer to the current financial system that is squeaking and creaking on all sides. ""Is bitcoin going to rise beyond $66,000? It could, but it certainly shows that it we've arrived at the complete bankruptcy of central banks,"" Thiel reveals in no uncertain terms.",1635167578,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfggao/germanamerican_billionaire_peter_thiel_regrets/
93,CryptoCurrency,Expert_Opening543,Selling strategies,"I threw a small amount of money at crypto in 2018 and didn't do anything else until last year. Then I started putting  small chunks of money in whenever I felt like it. In 2021 I started DCA every week so im finally getting excited and watching it climb.

I see people talk about if you put 1000 into bitcoij 10 years ago you would have 15 million ( or whatever it is now). But the point in making , or asking rather , is do you have a specific strategy to sell? I find it hard to believe that the people that started very early didn't sell WAY earlier than they would of liked. Because BTC at 5000 seemed crazy, they probably would of never believed 50,000. 

I obviously don't plan on holding forever because what's the point of investing all of this if you don't get to enjoy it but do you sell a certain percentage when the market goes up or down say 10 percent? 

I started DCA because I found that I wasn't disciplined enough to try to time the market. Too many doubts on if this was the bottom or top.

96,CryptoCurrency,belsaurn,"Taxes, XMR and Boating Accidents","I keep seeing people talk about if this happens or that happens regulation wise, that people would just put their profits into XMR or another privacy coin, or ""lose"" it in a boating accident to avoid taxes or regulations on it.

I would really like to know how you think that would avoid the government knowing about it or trying to tax you on it, and what good it would actually do you?

Lets say for example you moved all your crypto to XMR to avoid taxes on it. How would that hide it? You had to buy it some way, whether that is through an exchange, a dex or P2P, there would be a trail right up to you receiving the XMR. Sure they can't tell what you did with it after, but they would know you have it.

Now the boating accident situation, would losing your crypto make it be forgiven by the tax man? I know if you keep cash and your house burns down, you are still liable for the taxes you owe earning that cash no matter that it burnt. So how would ""losing"" it in a boating accident be any different?

Lastly, lets say you did manage to conceal it in XMR or convince the tax man you shouldn't pay tax on crypto you lost. What could you do with it then? If you want to spend it right now, you would have to be able to convert it to fiat at some point, meaning it would once again be traceable.

9,CryptoCurrency,undevy,Crypto won’t make you happy. It never could. Use your profit to care for yourself. Use crypto profits to get a better life for you and the people around you.,"&gt;**TL;DR**: It’s really fun to make money. But, you know what’s even more fun? Using crypto profits to take care of your mental health and well-being. Doing this will make you a better person for yourself, your family, and everyone you meet.

Since so many all-time highs have been reached lately, and a lot of our portfolios are in green, it is important to recognize that we are in a bull market at this point. **It won't last forever**, and it may not even last till the end of the year, so it is an interesting exercise to think about where all this is going.

Putting this post together is about how to step back from crypto psychologically. There isn't the best moment to do so, but **exiting with profits could be the most important step of your life**. Speaking from my own experience, by no means do I intend to give financial advice.

If you've been in this sub for a long time now, you can feel the greed and euphoria of every single market rise. The topic of taking your profits and DCA out has been discussed a lot recently. However, **we don't tackle enough the subject of what we should do next** when the profits aren't on paper but in our bank accounts.

Because the crypto market can go up and down in an instant, when you're in the green, it is important to appreciate that you reach your goals on time. We all know the HODL mantra, and having a lot of crypto in your portfolio is still a smart move, but you should also take advantage of bull markets to do good in the world.

**Are you really going to look at the charts every day until you die?** Cryptocurrencies should not become a source of dopamine for you. The world is a beautiful place, and you no doubt have a place in it. Remember that crypto is not our ultimate goal, and if we haven't learned by now, crypto won't make us happy. **If you look at your life after you've made a lot of money, it's easy to see that you're still the same person.** If you're happy, you're happy; if you're unhappy, you're unhappy. If you're only in it for the money, likely, you won't find any meaning or fulfillment.

Think about what you want in life, and do not focus on ""getting rich fast"", **focus on your deepest desires**. Use your profit as a tool to improve your life, by traveling, buying a new house, starting a business, paying off debt, or just enjoying life. The list of things that will bring genuine happiness is endless. Having never been happy in my life, I always assumed the reason was lack of money, but I realized that good profits could solve my money problems, but they definitely don't solve all my problems.

To be genuinely happy, I had to take responsibility for my mental health. I used some of my profits to focus on it and started feeling exponentially better. To be genuinely happy used to seem impossible to me, but boy, I have never been so wrong in my life! I am now happier than ever, and it feels incredible.

**Self-improvement is the most effective way to make the world a better place.** You don't have to be a narcissistic asshole, all you need to do is practice self-care and care for the people around you. You should never forget that the profits from selling parts of your crypto portfolio may help you live the life you really want.",1635166941,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfg8sr/crypto_wont_make_you_happy_it_never_could_use/

(I didn't want to post this in the Kusama or Polkadot sub because I would also like to hear other non-biased voices)

&amp;#x200B;

* Did you participate via Kraken or via the Kusama wallet?
* Did you participate in one or in multiple PC's?
* How long were your tokens locked?
* Did the PC meet their deadlines and did they respect their guidelines?
* how much profit ratio was there? Were you happy with the gains? Or is it a bit like staking rewards/supercharger rewards ?
* How big does you bag of DOT/KSM need to be? &lt;50, &gt;50, &gt;100,... 
* Will you participate in the Polkadot PC's?
* Tips? tricks?

12,CryptoCurrency,dealscavenger613,Quick Question SHIBIN coins,"Hey I bought some  SHIBIN yesterday at 11:37 AM and didn't think anything of it everything looked normal to me. Purchased for about $27 of BNB  and did not think anything was wrong. When it had a huge surge this morning I looked and it was still at approximately $30.

So then I looked at my wallet on bscscan and the number 2,843,627,954 SHIBIN  coins  where as in my wallet I only see 268,574,997  SHIBIN coins.

Now I'm not sure what to think, I'm obviously pretty new at all this and have no idea what to think. If I would have had 268,574,997  SHIBIN coins before the surge it should have shown me approximately 3 dollars.

24,CryptoCurrency,HiddenknifeX,So i took abit of profit instead of continuous HODLING..here's a thing..,"BTC went from 66 to high 59 yesterday and decided to take some profit on 3
coins which i had profit on and was relatively happy with how much i made. Thing is that everytime a dip came it cought me off guard reducing my profit to almost 0 or even creating minuses on my overall portofolio. That thing kept my money blocked for days or even months without being able to do anything just stare at numbers going low. The assets i sold represent like 50% of the portofolio, leaving behind only assets on which i have low profit or ""-"". 

I usually watch a few indicators that i guess showed me that BTC might dump a few ""k's"" if it reaches 59 since theres not so many orders between ~60 - 55. VPVR &amp; MACD (1D) . 

Now that i sold, BTC rose again and now i am pulled out of those assets on which i could have gotten bigger profit now, but at the same time the price could have gone south. Never know. 

What would be a good strategy now to enter again in those assets if i sold all units? 

Usually a good correction might be the case (20-30%)... but im afraid Alts will soon start pumping and i ve missed a bigger train.

25,CryptoCurrency,Lexikov,Have any of you heard of FEG token?,"Have any of you heard or invested in FEG yet?

Looks quite promising as a project, with good fundamentals and a bright roadmap ahead. It’s one of those hyper deflation tokens that looks much more promising than the other ones available. 

Would love to open a discussion with some of you regarding this. 

The main idea behind FEG Token is to provide a decentralized transaction network, which operates on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20) and the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20). The path forward for FEG Token is determined by market fluctuations, but the model it runs on begs FEG Token to succeed.
FEG Token is a hyper-deflationary token with a maximum circulating supply of 100Q (quadrillion) on both the Ethereum blockchain and the Binance Smart Chain that involves an inaccessible burn wallet. Depending on each holder’s percentage of ownership, a 2% transaction tax is distributed among all holders—this includes the burn wallet, which is essentially a holder that collects more tokens over time as transactions occur. As the circulating supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases. This inversely proportional relationship constitutes a supply and demand model. There is no limit as to how many tokens can be burnt. Without a burning limit, holders get to enjoy a never-ending cycle of passive income with positive price pressure!

Is there a point in connecting software wallets such as Exodus/Metamask to hardware wallets?

I understand that transactions will require the hardware to go through but if someone has the private key / restore keys to the software wallet they would still be able to access the software wallet right?

Does it just mean that someone with my keys would be able to ""login"" to my account but won't be able to send anything?

41,CryptoCurrency,cip43r,A story: my experience with a bank en centralised entity and why we need decentralization,"Before I start this discussion I would like to state that is not a shill for a specific network, protocol or token and my examples used are purely due to my experience, knowledge and situation that I am in.

I am a student that lives in an apartment building that uses prepaid electricity. Due to my own negligence and that of my room mate, we forgot to top up our account and my power has been turned off. 

My first problem with the entire system is that I can never actually see my exact balance. I receive a traditional sms once my balance is below a certain amount and when I deposit funds. I also can't see my actual usage and for all I know they steal my electricity. This is pure speculation, but there is no exact log.

On my way home I called the company and a nice lady answered and helped me. Our conversation consisted of the following:

1. From which bank did you pay?
2. Was an instantaneous payment used?

Immediately I said I don't know as it was my flat mate that paid but I gave an educated guess and she said it will take 24 hours to reflect. Secondly, she said because it wasn't instantaneous it might also be the reason why my power isn't on.

My first though after this conversation was, that if I were to send my flat mate some BTC and they had a Binance account, I could use any supported network. Original BTC, wrapped BTC on ERC20 or even BEP20 or BEP2. Either way, they would have received the payment as long as they gave me the network of choice's address. Thus, I could pay them almost instantly using any network and the fees and speed would be my choice. 

So are you telling me there are banks in Switzerland older than 100 years and all of the banks in my country have existed for more than 50 years and this surperior payment system cannot communicate between banks? So I have banking fees because my bank has a dedicated team of developers working on a glorified SQL server which cannot communicate with others?

Secondly, there exists a special payment for me to send funds to other banks?

So you are telling me, interoperability between blockchains is own of the essential features we all on this sub want, but my bank can't even do that? And if I want interoperability I need to pay an extra fee for my bank account to talk to another.

Finally, why do I even need this company and 2 different banks? Why can't my meter have a wallet of its own or be some kind of IOT device using something like Nano or IOTA or even BTC or ETH, where I deposit the funds directly into the device? Why do I need to send a payment from one bank, to another and then some desk jockey makes changes on a SQL server to reflect my payment?

This entire situation is just so frustrating. My payment is somewhere in limbo and I am sitting without electricity because the current surperior payment system doesn't offer interoperability unless I essentially pay a fine for having the fucking audacity to move funds out of my bank account. 

TLDR: We need decentralization and current blockchains employ better interoperability than the traditional financial system.",1635165735,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qffv2l/a_story_my_experience_with_a_bank_en_centralised/

I'm sure this is common knowledge to most of you here, but when researching various other assets - stocks, metals, ETFs etc, I was pleasantly surprised to see a number of coins with market caps rivalling some of the worlds biggest companies, not to mention keeping up and exceeding market caps of almost all precious metals. Except the big two!

Let's hope this post ages poorly, for all the right reasons. 

# The takeaway - BTC

* There are only 5 companies in the world with a bigger market cap than Bitcoin. That is, Saudi Aramco and the 4 tech giants (Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon).
* There are only two metals with a bigger market cap than Bitcoin. Silver and Gold.
* That puts Bitcoin at #8 on the list.

# Some more takeaway - ETH

* Perhaps more surprising to me was Ethereum, making it to #17 on this list.
* Etherum has bigger market cap than some massive multinationals. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Samsung and MasterCard to name a few.

# The challengers

* BTC needs to increase by approximately 15% to 72.8K USD to overtake silver
* BTC needs to increate by approximately 42% to 89K USD to overtake Amazon
* The bulls on here would have you believe both of those are doable by the end of 2021. IMO overtaking silver this year is all but inevitable, Amazon may be a tougher nut to crack.

# The leader board

Shills and scams and memecoins are a byproduct of the system. It actually helps identify and set apart the good projects from the crap. And people, most new people, will come to crypto because of the shit like this. Because of the availability of the cesspool that is Robinhood

I want to know what is the issue here exactly because I have been contacting the Gamivo support for a while now, but they didn't give me any helpful support and kept saying that the payment provider will return your money. As i can understand binance are the payment provider !

71,CryptoCurrency,ChiefKeithh,I’m in the green for the first time in my crypto career,"I probably would have sold for a hefty loss if it wasn’t for Reddit so thank you.

It all began around May this year when my friend was telling me about his sweet crypto gains. I wanted some.

With an intention of buying and not looking at it again for 5 years, I slapped a fat lump sum investment across BTC, ETH and MATIC. Buying BTC at $60k and a +$2 MATIC as well, I can’t remember the ETH entry but can’t imagine it was great. I forgot to mention I didn’t even know what a blockchain was at this point.

Obviously we all know what happened in May. I can’t lie soiled my pants when when the market plummeted. Little did I know, that soil would be the fertiliser that made me grow into the man I am today. Luckily I turned to Reddit before cashing it all out, I was close, but even though 50% of the sub seemed to have also soiled themselves some of you managed to relieve my worries, so thanks.

You taught me the importance of knowing what I was investing my money into. So I went and learnt what a blockchain was, those things are pretty cool. Although I did hit a point where I thought because I could explain to my friends what a blockchain was, that it made me some kind of crypto god and started swapping a load of them around daily. Let’s just say I learned the hard way.

5 months on, I now have a sensible DCA strategy in place. Only investing in coins that I personally believe in, not what user MegaFartSniffer69 thinks is going to the moon.

As a beginner I can’t really contribute much to the sub so I thought I’d just make a bit of a thank you post since I was so happy to have finally made some gains!

I am an ardent fan and user of CRO token. I had this question that the CRO token is more like a stable coin, its price doesn't rise up as fast.

I sometimes wonder that it is in the best interest of Crypto.com, to keep this price as such. As most of their products requiring staking of say, 10,000 CRO tokens, which a layman like me can afford.

However, if the price were to shoot up to say, $1 this requirement would go up to $10K, which mot people wouldn't be able to afford. CRO is mostly controlled by the crypto.com exchange.

The Moon tokens haven't yet appeared in my MetaMask wallet, and from subsequent googling I have read that the Moon tokens aren't yet on the Ethereum main net, but are instead on the  Rinkeby test network. Have I just lost my Moon tokens?

50,CryptoCurrency,anon_ghost_123,What is the best source of stable passive income in Crypto?,"Hi guys,

I'd like to know the best place to invest my salary, and make stable passive returns.

I'm good on the programming side (I'm a Smart Contract Dev for a DAO), but I'm a finance noob.

I'm not interested in more complex stuff (like Leverage Trading). I know my limitations and won't get into anything I don't understand.

I'm also not interested in methods that require a lot of work (constantly checking prices and whatnot). I want it to be as passive as possible. Invest and forget.

I saw these:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pitnji/using\_cryptos\_to\_earn\_passive\_income\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pitnji/using_cryptos_to_earn_passive_income_my/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lk2rtw/the\_ultimate\_guide\_to\_earning\_passive\_income\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lk2rtw/the_ultimate_guide_to_earning_passive_income_with/)

But instead of comparing the overall methods, I want to get more specific (protocols and trading pairs).

From what I've seen, the main candidates are:

* Anchor Protocol (\~20% APY, decentralized)
* Lending USDT (\~30% APY, centralized)
* Staking
* Providing Liquidity for Dexes

A few questions:

1. Rates of 20% and 30% seem to good to be true. Are these rates untrusworthy? Or is my perception skewed due to the crappy rates offered by banks?
2. Comparing KuCoin USDT Lending and Anchor Protocol:
   1. How would you compare security between them? While Anchor is decentralized, Kucoin is not. How trustworthy is Kucoin USDT lending?
   2. I have my doubts around USDT. I prefer either algorithmic stablecoins (like DAI or UST) or USDC because at least is backed by something. Is using USDT even a good idea?
   3. Lending USDT on Kucoin has higher returns than Anchor because it compounds daily, right? If so, are any there other suitable candidates with daily compounding?
3. If I was to provide liquidity for a Dex, would providing liquidity for a stablecoin pair (USDC/DAI or USDC/USDT) remove the risk of impermanent loss?
4. Staking seems simple, but I have some doubts regarding PoS. Aren't the staking rewards basically causing inflation? Yeah, a coin might have 50% staking rewards, but wouldn't its price just eventually drop, making the staking itself pointless?
5. I'd like to use this passive income for a living. Do I have to keep all of my funds locked in these protocols? Or can I keep the initial investment locked, but make monthly withdrawals of the returns? Maybe I can even withdraw any amount I want?

Any other suggestions?

What's stopping you? Mainly, the fear of losing money. After all, the powerful people at the head of the current system keep telling you that Bitcoin is dangerous because it is too volatile.

The main reason they talk about Bitcoin is so that you don't do your own research and realize that Bitcoin's volatility will only impact you in the short term. If you buy Bitcoin with a long-term view, then this volatility will no longer be an issue.

Furthermore, not taking action with Bitcoin is exactly what makes you lose money.

Indeed, while you are hesitating, your purchasing power in US dollars is being eaten away by inflation which has been above 5% for several months in America. Contrary to what Jerome Powell tried to make you believe, the situation will not be transitory. This inflation will persist and it is up to you to take care of your future regarding money.

Once you understand that you need to invest, you will ask yourself the question of which markets to go into.

If you take a quick look, you'll see that the real estate market is already overheating in the middle of a bubble. The stock market is moving at record levels, but that's not likely to last forever. Commodities have risen sharply in 2021, and a correction is expected in 2022.

Inflation-linked bonds may be an option given the very high inflation we have to deal with, but I am not a fan of this kind of product.

Gold may be an option, but the precious metal has been struggling to convince since the summer of 2020 when the price per ounce exceeded $2,000. Gold is underperforming while we are in the midst of great monetary inflation. This is a signal that something is changing. Gold is slowly but surely leaving the hearts of investors.

If gold is leaving the hearts of investors, it is primarily because another store of value has been emerging for several years. This is Bitcoin, which has proven since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that it can act as a safe haven in times of crisis.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the price of Bitcoin has increased tenfold. More and more investors see Bitcoin as a digital version of gold. Of course, Bitcoin allows for much more than that, but as it stands, that's how many investors view the digital currency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin also has the advantage of being perfectly suited to tomorrow's world where everything will become digital. Future generations will see Bitcoin as normalcy, while gold will be seen as something impractical and outdated.

So taking action with Bitcoin is a way to keep up with the world while protecting the fruits of your labor from the inflation that will continue to wreak havoc in the months and years to come.",1635158977,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfe1co/for_those_who_are_still_hesitating_to_take_action/
88,CryptoCurrency,ragnarokfps,I'm hearing a lot of talk about NFT gaming and how it's the future of gaming. Let me tell you why that's false,"I've been a gamer since 1997, I also like my crypto. For those of you who like crypto (particularly NFT's), but aren't gamers, here's a friendly bit of advice. Don't hold your breath for NFT gaming to happen. It will never happen, and here's why. It's pretty simple, really. Gamers fucking *hate* microtransactions. Period, full stop. But to explain how this came to be, you have to understand what video games are, and why people play them. Once you understand that, you will know why NFT's don't mix with video games. 

On May 15, 2012, the long awaited Diablo 3 game came out. This is one of the most popular and well-known video game franchises in the world, with it's successor having released 12 years earlier in 2000. Diablo fans had been waiting for this game a very long time. This game came out in 2012 with an in-game auction house, where players could buy and sell their gear for fake in-game gold, or real life hard currency, those greenbacks. This completely destroyed the game, and made national news headlines at least in the US. The game's developer and publisher were publicly flamed mercilessly on the internet by Diablo players until the developers decided to remove the auction from the game. This was such an outrage to gamers that this fiasco transcended the Diablo universe and enraged players had never even played a Diablo game. The backlash against this had never been seen before, or since. That was a painful lesson for Diablo's developers and publisher, and was more or less the equivalent of a public execution in the town square for what's now commonly known today as microtransactions in video games. 

Sinfe then, every time a game developer put microtransactions in their video games, they were publicly humiliated by the gamers that play those games, with countless lawsuits and even federal laws and regulations being put in place to prevent certain kinds of microtransactions. This is all public knowledge at this point, 9 years later, so you can PreSearch microtransactions in video games or Diablo 3 auction house to your heart's content.

For your own sake, I don't recommend investing in gaming NFT's. There's a long and bitter history of microtransactions in video games, and if that shit fiat currency can't even make it work, NFT's aren't going to fare any better. 

This is not financial advice, just the memory of a bitter Diablo fan",1635158868,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfe0ct/im_hearing_a_lot_of_talk_about_nft_gaming_and_how/

94,CryptoCurrency,Business-Typical,The Taxing of Unrealized Gains More Than Likely Won’t Apply To You,"Lawmakers are considering taxing the unrealized capital gains of billionaires as a way to raise money to help pay for President Joe Biden’s broad social and climate spending plans.

It’s only affecting people with $1 billion in assets or those who have brought in $100 million in income for three consecutive years. 


**That Being Said, I’m Still Very Much Opposed  To This.** 


This is how the fuckery begins. ‘Give them an inch they take a mile’ sort of deal. I highly doubt it will pass considering their first ‘targets’ are the extremely wealthy. But if it were I have no doubt that it would trickle down to us. Regardless, this is a ridiculous proposal.

I've made a new educational video that will teach you how to analyze wallets, contracts, and blockchain transactions on BSCScan (Same as EtherScan and PolyScan, etc..).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x61IVwXfXNI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x61IVwXfXNI)

We will learn how to read transactions, how to track wallets, contracts and monitor the flow of the money and the tokens on the Binance Smart Chain network.

 We will also learn how to track our own wallets and see what kind of tokens we have and what transactions we send and receive.

Working with blockchain trackers like BSCScan, EtherScan, PolygonScan, etc, is very important and if you know how to read transactions and track wallets and smart contracts, your level of understanding in Crypto and DEFI will be much higher.

You will be able to understand your assets, investments, your trades, and the functions that you call in smart contracts, instead of being a noob who is just clicking buttons and doesn't understand what it does in the backend.

Also, tracking the blockchain using websites like BSCScan, you can find good trading and investments opportunities by tracking relevant interesting wallets.

This guide should cover and give very good fundamentals in order to start monitoring and tracking DEFI and blockchains.

Would be more than happy to hear what you think about this guide :)

Based on previous trends,  [BTC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)   retraces each major move up to the .5 fibonacci level. So it falls  back 50% of it's major move up to 'consolidate' before moving upwards  again.  [BTC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)  is now retracing to the .5 fibonacci level, to an estimated $54-56k area. This would complete the  [Elliot wave](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/elliottwaves/)  part 4.   
 

Based on the recent major move to $65k, an  [fibonacci extension](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/fibonacciextension/)  can be used to measure that move and aid us in predicting the next major  [resistance level](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/supportandresistance/)  and also complete  [Elliot Wave](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/elliottwaves/)  part 5. The  [Fibonacci Extension](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/fibonacciextension/)   predicts that based on a retrcement to $54-56k area, the an extended  move will reach $80k. This logically makes sense as traders love round  numbers to work with. If the $80k dollar is exceeded on a pump through,  the next resistance would be at the  [1.618 extension](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/1618fibonacciextension/)  , which is $96k. I would expect $100k to be the true resistance, but  setting sell orders for swing traders slightly underneath would be the  risk appropriate strategy.    
 

I currently have no position in  [Bitcoin ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) . This information is based on my opinion and a  [bullish](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/bullish/)  market segment, any bad news may  [alter ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EURONEXT-ALTER/)  this prediction.

While I was taking a walk in a nice street full of shops, as usual I opened my wallet to check the crypto balance (this is something I still do twice per day). In this specific wallet I opened I only have BTC and the amount I saw was € X.

Right after closing the app, my eyes went to a display window of a jewelry store where a wonderful ring was looking at me! It was a very nice ring that would have fitted just perfectly my lady 's hand and crazy things: the price was € X, exactly the one of my Satoshis balance 😲.

It was actually identical to the penny! 😲

That was the moment I decided to use my Satoshi to buy my girlfriend an engagement ring, and I'm  not gonna regret it 😍

Having looked through recent posts most are just talking about the compound glitch and not necessarily the long term of the project.

So what do you degenerates think about compound in the long term? Is AAVE just the better move with its variable and stable interest rates?",1635154788,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfd1za/do_people_still_believe_in_compound_comp_or_has/
57,CryptoCurrency,Solutar,Is Hype stronger than Utility?,"Hello everyone,

Memecoins are making massive price rally’s and are quickly picked up in cryptospaces, like this one, and everyone is talking about them more and more which seems to reflect on the Price. 
For example when Elon musk mentioned Dogecoin the price literally exploded.

So I was wondering how did BTC start? I mean it was a revolutionary idea that was also picked up by many, but was it because of its utility as store of value, or more because hipsters and tech geeks and others hyped it up? It doesn’t seem to me like a memecoin but it’s price is raising too.

I’ve seen some people say this is just how the market is working at the moment, utility is being forgotten and only hype and memes are important. But if so, for how long? I would be depressingly frustrated if projects with GREAT utility die because the market favors memecoins.

Anyway, I’m just a bit confused about the whole crypto situation at the moment, so if anyone with a little bit more knowledge could tell me what’s going on, that would be great, thank you.

Sorry for my English, it isn’t my first language.",1635154487,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfczkt/is_hype_stronger_than_utility/
60,CryptoCurrency,SpaceFaceMistake,"Seeking help as a newb ~18 months into crypto. What field of study should I begin? Should I study accounting, business or personal finance, economics or other field/s of study or all of the above?","TLDR: What study units or courses should I learn formal or informal to gain better understanding in finances with end goal of managing my own crypto and or other exchanged positions?

To start here is some basic info on my finacial and crypto history. 

I have a small amount of crypto of which has been earned from learning, referring or from legitimate giveaways or tips. I don’t own any other stocks or shares. I understand income tax and capital gains tax. I understand how crypto works more than I do for fiat and or business stocks. I am yet to put any of my own money into any market on the stock exchange.

Within the 18 months I’ve been following and learning about cryptocurrency I’ve learned the basics. I know how to store and securely access and transact crypto being on the chain not on a wallet as I, like many assumed to start with. I know the main terms in the crypto space and some terms within finances. I can make some sense of charts and some indicators that are easily read but I don’t have any in-depth charting knowledge or know how. I have always been good with math/numeracy over english/literacy.

I don’t plan on trading but I may end up trading. I am more interested for now on how to invest and invest well. I mean unless there is a good reason I should learn to trade first before learning to invest? 

Basically I just feel like I need to do some proper study that leads to experience though work placement. With the study leading to understanding and then to comfortably investing on my own. Like for anything non-crypto it would be way smarter and safer to use a broker as their knowledge outweighs mine 10 fold.

To me the same applies to crypto but there aren’t personal brokers for it except for the very new ETFs. It’s that those that understand finacial markets before or while crypto has been around, they will be able to understand the crypto markets a whole lot better than any crypto enthusiast or follower or owner. Unless those followers or owners were or are finacial brokers or have learned finacial systems and that of what a broker would learn and the experience from holding a job in finance or stock broking.

Ideally I need a course or field of study long and or short that would help open my eyes to how finances, economy and the stock market works. I mean I’ve been told to learn accounting but I still don’t know if that would be ideal or if another field of study would be better suited to the study of finacial markets leading to having a greater understanding in finance to be able to make decisions on my own with regard to crypto and other markets positions.

Any help or advice will be very much appreciated. 🙏",1635154364,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfcynj/seeking_help_as_a_newb_18_months_into_crypto_what/
70,CryptoCurrency,Monster_Chief17,"Almost all ""NFT Gaming tokens"" will be dropping to zero as soon as the cycle is over. Maybe even sooner.","ICOs are back and this time they are disguised as ""gaming tokens"". Just like all of them flopped, NFT gaming will probably have to suffer a similar fate. Here are a few reasons why I think that:


* Getting started with NFT games can cost a few thousand. And this is just to **get started**. They all boast about a play-to-earn model but no one is telling you that you need $3k to actually have a chance to earn. There are very few people that actually have that kind of money to throw into the fire so there is very little chance any of these games manage to acquire a decent player base.


* Most of these games aren't even games. They are just roadmaps and promise that you will get a game but you need to wait.  ICO survivors still have PTSD from *Soon™*.


* Commenting NFT gaming on Ethereum is pointless at this point. It's like paying $50 to make one move in a game of chess that you are trying to play for fun.


* Lastly, most ""games"" I found that are actually playable on cheaper blockchains like Wax or Fantom are either simple clicking games or very shitty ones made in Unity.



I can give props to Gods Unchained and a handful of others but it is really not looking good so far. Crypto marketing is pushing the Metaverse narrative but if you actually use blockchains you know that there is still no Metaverse out there.

Then you only need to know that is a shitty platform whit many shitty coins.

I read at the moment more often here, that some pump&amp;dumb communitys working there for making „easy Money“. Because there are many coins listen you don’t even heard about them „yet“.

This platform is really shitty. When you change your coin/tokens to a other there always small amount leftovers. You can’t change them because it’s a too small amount. I have now 7 positions with 15-30 cents leftovers. 
{not much, but still money}

And the worst part is that the transactions fees are regulated. This means you pay for BTC transaction back to your wallet always 0.0005BTC = 30-40$. I found the smallest transaction fee at USDT. There it is 20$
It’s doesn’t change for the amount you wanna send. This is ridiculous. 

Okay with some big amount of money, it’s not a problem but for some small fish like me it’s almost impossible to go out from this platform without lose.

11,CryptoCurrency,nikil1253,The Bitcoin price launching to six figures?,"As most people who own bitcoin know, price drawdowns that are greater than 50% have been a regular occurrence after each all-time high. What we also know is that bitcoin price has proven to significantly recover from every major drawdown, which has made it the best performing asset over the last decade

Currently we're rebounding from a 56% price drawdown post a 228% recovery, Historically what comes next is yet another massive recovery. This double top pattern playing out is eerily similar to 2013 where price went on to explode over 10 times in just 52 days, starting in early October. As we hover around $66,000, a six-figure bitcoin price is only a 51% price move away. This is a more conserative percentage move during a bitcoin bull cycle recovery based on previous cycles

History may not repeat itself exactly but all of the on-chain metrics, recent price action and expectations of new entrant demand, during the most bullish holder behavior in bitcoin's history, have signaled a major price recovery underway.

At its core, bitcoin price is a function of new demand, through increased adoption, relative to the amount of limited supply available on the market.

22,CryptoCurrency,reaglesham,I’ve decided to become a Crypto Monk,"And so my journey begins. As a not-very-wealthy dude who’s employment was sideswiped by COVID and is yet to fully recover, its tough to keep DCA going for my small crypto investments. Because I believe in crypto, I started small, making tiny savings here and there, and over time my philosophy has changed. When you don’t have much to work with and you try to invest, you look at that beer, sandwich or new videogame and think “do I really need this?”. I started re-evaluating my expenses - do they actually make me happy?

Around the same time, my fitness began to wane and I realised how much money I was spending on alcohol, junk food and unhealthy snacks. Fitness is a big deal for me, so I decided to get back on that horse - working out and eating the classic diet of chicken, rice and broccoli. As I work to improve my health, I feel better about myself. Sure, the junk food tastes good, but the effect it has on my fitness was detrimental to my mood in the long run. Is the momentary bliss of a cheeseburger worth the long-term hit to my self-esteem (and arteries)? When I’m in good health, I’m in a good mood, so it’s best to cut out those expensive, unhealthy purchases in favour of a more humble diet - plus it leaves me more for crypto.

Videogames, streaming services and movies bring me a lot of enjoyment, but I’m sitting on a backlog of games I’ve never played, movies I’ve never watched and streaming services I don’t often use. Why chase the next new game when 2018’s back catalogue is still barely played? Cutting these, I either value the purchases I’ve made more, or decide to spend my time doing other, potentially more fulfilling things. It’s a win-win - plus it leaves me more for crypto.

The tenets of the crypto monk began to emerge:

* **Do not chase fleeting happiness** as it will quickly fade. Find joy in the experiences that you cherish, and explore the experiences you have undervalued until now.
* **What strengthens the body emboldens the mind** and with health comes happiness.
* **If you truly see value in something, it is worth the expense** \- the life of the crypto monk is about living well and valuing your life, not reducing your enjoyment of life to chase financial gain. If you believe a purchase will improve your life, do it. If it falls short, you’ll know more about yourself and what you value for next time.
* **Invest what you save into your future**. May your financial security bring you peace in the years to come.
* **Don’t chase pumps.** This way lies destruction.

From now on I hope to value what I have, and enrich my life rather than filling it with frivolous purchases. My health will improve, my mental health along with it, and all of this will leave me more money to invest in crypto projects I believe in - hopefully reducing the financial turmoil of my future.

Now if you need me, I’ll be in my monastery performing my daily ritual of chart-watching and praying to the great bulls to free us from the clutches of the bears that wish to pull us down.",1635150661,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfc6j4/ive_decided_to_become_a_crypto_monk/

34,CryptoCurrency,Mettez,It honestly makes me happy to see regular media outlets reporting on the rising 'memecoin' phenomenon,"I'm not sure what exact emotion it triggers within me, but a part of me truly feels happy and giddy every time I see MSM talking about so called 'memecoins'. I'm not personally invested in them, my heart can't take it. I was lucky enough to have a lucky 200% gain on Doge a while back before I pulled out, and I didn't dare putting any money in Shiba. Nevertheless, it never feels like I'm 'left out', instead it really triggers my funny bone every time these coins are mentioned by the 'classier' news outlets.

I really think we (as in, people active on r/cc) severely underestimate (or underestimated perhaps) the strength and place 'memecoins' have in the crypto market. I understand that tokenomics are important, and that a lot of people might/will be rug pulled, but we cannot deny that memecoins are a great way to attract new people to the space. Let me rephrase:

People unfamiliar with investing/crypto usually don't care about jargon like APR, APY, staking, impermanence loss, market cap, etc. So, they aren't 'attracted' to the same information that we care about, as we now have been in the space for at least some time. Using myself as a practical example, dogecoin is what got me initially interested in crypto. Call it, a gateway crypto. Because of me wanting to own some (not caring about making a lot of money just yet, only putting in x euros), I made my first account on an exchange. That lead me to checking out other crypto names, and seeing those few euros turn into a few more, drove me to reading about actually investing in crypto. I made my first wallet(s), got a bit more informed, and now I'm actually investing a relatively large part of my liquid net value in crypto. I'm no longer into memecoins, but not because I don't think they matter, I'm just not willing to take part in the risk involved.

However, I think that some people forget how they started out, or that not everyone is aware of how investing works and what to watch out for when they are younger. Add the complexity of the crypto space as a whole to it, and all of a sudden, funny dog currencies as a meme seem extremely plausible! You know, in a very weird way, meme's were the original 'decentralized' internet interactions. Nobody 'bought' a meme, or could pay for one, the collective decided what meme's grew or became popular, almost like how funny dog coins are behaving now.. 🤔",1635149935,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfc18y/it_honestly_makes_me_happy_to_see_regular_media/

Here they are pretty crazy about crypto as well. I have a couple of friends here that admittedly are just gambling on ripple winning a lawsuit and making a breakthrough and have no idea the tech behind any of this. It's admittedly a problem for some because they will spend their workday trying to day trade shitcoins like doge, get recktd and lose their job.

I guess where I'm going with this is, I thought BTC breaking an ATH meant that everyone would be talking about it because crypto was mainstream and cool now. Nah, I guess this is still just magic internet money and it won't be on more people's minds until it is all making 50%&lt; gains in a week.

I was hoping when I was doing a word wall about technology this week some students would say bitcoin or blockchain, so far I am disappointed. A couple of weeks ago I used AI pics as a warmup and how deepfakes could be dangerous for news in the future. With the news of Associated Press opening a node on LINK, I've just been jumping at the bit to reference that in class. How blockchain can fight misinformation. Maybe it is just my students but it only seems like I have only two student out of 420ish (I'm not memeing on that either) interested in blockchain.

I guess I will have to give it another month when BTC is hitting crazy levels for students to be trying to talk to me about it. If they ask, I'm just gonna say that it is interesting technology but I can't invest because I am a foreigner and the bank won't let me buy it.

I’m seeing a bright future with these next few months. And with altcoin season approaching, now is a great time to stake and loan! Right now, I absolutely love staking. The interest rates are astronomically higher than those offered by fiat savings accounts.

Right now, I'm staking my **Tezos** and **Cardano** using **Ledger**, and also did some lending on [**Celsius**](https://celsius.network/), [**Haru Invest**](https://haruinvest.com/), and Nexo because their yields have much higher percentages (also risky lol), so I diversified with both staking and lending instead to get the best of both because the compounding will add up quite a bit over the coming year(s) (Hopefully).

Staking is unquestionably safer when done with a cold wallet, but I think that most lending businesses strive to ensure that their customers are as secure as possible too. Like seriously though, Get staking (or loan/lend) people. We're going to have a lot of fun in the future!

81,CryptoCurrency,FaithBlackshadow,Why Buy Crypto When You Can Buy Stock: PART III,"Hi kids. It's me again. 

After challenging all you 'experts' to answer the question posed in a mature and thoughtful way and getting pelted with the usual juvenile trash that is the hallmark of soft-bellied, bespectacled Dungeons &amp; Dragons-esque  nebbishes that are resident on all  internet forums everywhere,  I was able to  sort  through the wild-eyed raving,  name-calling and the bizarre theories on dismantling the global financial system and rebuilding it in some whacky hodge-podge of cartoon character ""NFT's"" and then sift out the coherent responses of  the mature and rational 1% 

 Based on that and greatly condensing the very same,  I have come up with just a few, more tangible and reality-based reasons to buy crypto *in addition to* real  world assets like stock and real estate.

Here are the top three:

1) **To make a profit**, regardless of politics, rebelling against your parents or childish 'virtue signaling' 

2) The action buzz

3) It runs 24/7 like a casino

Pursuant to the above captioned incentives, and so as not to miss out on potential drug-dealer style profiteering, I have made the leap into crypto trading.  I'm sure there are more lofty-sounding, contrived and excessively wordy narratives. But my goal is to make money, not change the world. 

I just want all of the crypto purists to admit they are just as greedy as I am and that dressing up a dice game as investing does not alter the truth.

Having arrived at this juncture, the dilemma becomes which of the 6000 or so cartoon 'currencies' to throw darts at....",1635146566,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfbcea/why_buy_crypto_when_you_can_buy_stock_part_iii/

87,CryptoCurrency,Prestigious-Low-8942,Why this is not about useability,"I read dozens of times how important the usability of a blockchain for the coin is. 

I even read about people being happy that they sold their ""shitcoins"" to buy ""real projects"" like ada, dot or terra. And people commenting that this is wise and everybody should do that. 

I trade for several years now with coins and regardless that i made the mode out of eth and btc, i have to say, that this ""real project"" stuff is bullshit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why? This is really easy to explain: 

Did you ever integrate some of those ""real projects"" into your project? pretty surely not. Do you have a friend who did? Pretty surely not. They might have a useability (e.g. brave token/bat and filecoin) but nobody really uses it (for now).

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin

The most potential use use case of a coin is the transaction method. And every coin is providing this. Bitcoin is the most preferrable, because it is well known on the black market for long. 

&amp;#x200B;

To Summarize: 

The projects might have a future, but for today:   
A filecoin has as much usability as a shiba inu coin. They are just not used today.   
So why should a whale put his money into a coin (and drop it after everybody gets fomo'd and buys) which has a great market cap? This is far more expensive than buying and dropping a cheap coin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: 

Buy a few ""shitcoins"" too as long they are cheap. It wont hurt you",1635145138,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfb17l/why_this_is_not_about_useability/
88,CryptoCurrency,phexi111,Today the German government auctions bitcoins of darknet drug dealers worth millions of EUR.,"Interesting case from Germany: Today, the ministry of justice in one of Germany's states (NRW) auctions bitcoins from some guys who got caught selling drugs on the internet.

The government got access to the bitcoins and wondered what they could do with it. Their legal counsels came to the conclusion that it has to be treated like other items gained from criminal activities and hence has to be auctioned and sold to the public. The state will keep the money from the auction.

This lead to a big hype in Germany because these auctions usually lead to a discount of about ~80% from whatever is sold.

A new tax law is being proposed in the US which will require cryptocurrency investors to pay taxes on the profits from their investments even before they sell their coins.


If this ridiculous law is passed, it will:


1. Force you to sell your crypto when you're in profit, which would keep further price increase in check. Thus reducing the opportunity to make further gains.


2. Make everyone a ninja, doing everything to conceal their crypto wealth.


3. Probably discourage people from investing in crypto in the first place.



My hope is that they also make provision to pay us for unrealized losses on our crypto assets. At least this will encourage me to gamble more on shitcoins without fear.

I've seen a few social media posts from people just learning about NFTs getting frustrated that some of the different collections take research to figure out first, before being able to make an informed purchase. This illustration is meant to serve as a reminder that many NFTs can be thought of as ""collectibles"" (in addition to ""fine art"", ""game assets"" or other ""utility"" aspects), and for most collecting hobbies in the non-digital world, there's a connotation that some research is needed to start that ""hobby"", and that's okay.

In that photo are a few items that might have intrinsic worth to a collector. Most adults will know that there are some people who collect coins, and some old coins are worth a lot of money, even if they themselves don't collect coins. Same with trading cards; even if you don't want to own trading cards to play a game with them, seeing a trading card in a hard plastic sleeve gives a hint that the owner thought it valuable enough to give it another layer of protection, so maybe it's most valuable, since the coin doesn't have a protective case? That device pictured looks like a smartphone; it might be fairly valuable, if it's a recent model? Even for someone who's not extremely tech-savvy, they'd be able to guess it's not *decades* old, since they didn't make smartphones back then.

My point is that it would likely take someone at least a few hours research to determine the worth of these things, if they weren't a collector already. When approaching NFT projects that aren't just ""fine art"" pieces, we haven't yet reached a level of public awareness of what ""hints"" a casual observer can recognize as cues (like the hard case protecting a trading card a lot of adults would recognize as interpret as a clue of value), and so it takes a bit more research to become aware what the nuances of each collection are. So, I guess this is partly a fun exercise in comparing physical to digital collectibles, and partly my plea/reminder to be helpful to newcomers as they try and gain those ""reflexes"" for what to look for, and if you are a newcomer, to realize this is a new ""skill"" and so it's okay if it takes at least a little bit of work to understand, and not to feel discouraged if it doesn't ""click"" right away.

So, back to my original question in the title: that is an NFT shown on the screen of that device (it's ""MoonCat #1289"").

What’s the bare minimum number of cards you need to be able to make money? How much do you make per card? 

Any other costs that come into play that people might not be aware of (ie other than electricity, taxes, cooling etc)?

What would you say your annual return / profit margin is - how much do you earn per $1k in costs?

How often do you need to replace your cards (either because they die or become obsolete competitively)?

How has your profitability changed as you’ve scaled up, mining has become more competitive, block rewards halved?",1635141512,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfa8mc/bitcoin_miners_whats_your_setup_and_how_much_are/

45,CryptoCurrency,shalyar,4 Types of Token Offering Scams and How to Avoid them," `Credit to Houbi Blog:`

Token offerings (sometimes called Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs) are a way for crypto projects to raise funding and an opportunity for investors to make money by buying new project tokens before their prices rise on the market. 

While many token offerings were legitimate, and many projects failed because of simple business or economic reasons, scams involving token offerings were widespread from 2014 onwards as scammers took advantage of the crypto hype, a lack of awareness of how crypto worked, and human flaws like greed and fear. 

Token offering scams have fallen significantly after Huobi launched its Huobi Prime token offering platform in 2017. This is also due in part to better public education about how cryptocurrencies work, but also because of the simplified and verified process that Huobi Prime uses to evaluate new projects before allowing them on our platform. 

Even though investors on the Huobi Prime platform can rest easy, many scams still happen outside of Huobi’s ecosystem and a savvy investor must learn how to identify and avoid them. 

Here are some of the most popular scams committed as a token offering: 

 

# The Exit Scam 

The exit scam happens when an insider raises funds for the project and subsequently closes or exits the project with raised funds. This leaves the investor with a bag of tokens with no inherent value.  

This can either happen with a token project or an exchange that is raising funds. Like in the case of Thodex, where the founder, Ozer, disappeared with investors' funds. 

# Airdrop Scam 

Airdrop refers to free tokens given to investors in exchange for adoption of a new platform, purchase of new tokens, or locking in of tokens. 

A project will usually allocate a portion of the token supply to be distributed to investors, by doing so, it allows the token project owners to gather a mass audience with the pretense of giving out free cryptocurrency. 

The scam works by getting parties interested in the airdrop to submit personal information, private keys or purchasing tokens to receive more airdrops. The interested parties may get the airdropped tokens, but these tokens might not have value or very little value as compared to the information that the scammers have obtained. 

The OmiseGo airdrop scam is one of the largest scams in the history of crypto. OmiseGo (OMG) was supposed to be airdropped in September 2017, but it got postponed. Scammers took this opportunity, creating fake Twitter handles, Telegram chat groups, fake Forums threads and sites, tricking unsuspecting users into submitting their private keys. It was reported that more than 300 Ether were lost to scammers. 

# Phishing Scams 

Even today, phishing scam is one that many investors fall for. Scammers disguise as legit entities or a trusted source deceives the victim into thinking that his or her account is getting hacked. Which subsequently, the victim will be brought to a fake site that resembles the legit entity. The victim is then prompted to change sensitive information like passwords and 2FA, of which, the scammer can access the victim’s account to perform malicious transactions. 

It is reported that such scams have [rose more than 1000%](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-investment-scams/) and cost investors almost $80 million dollars. 

# Pump and Dump 

During a token offering or token sale, investors exchange their cryptocurrencies for the new token. The project owner or team will share in their whitepaper how many tokens will be released for sale, set aside for future development and so on. 

 📷Figure 1:Axie Infinity Token Breakdown | www.axieinfinity.com  

 

Most project have a soft cap and hard cap of how much funds they will be raising. Often, whales will enter this space to buy up majority of the tokens which leaves very little for investors who truly support the project. 

And upon exchange listing, these whales send signal to various social media group indication that the token is a “Buy” as it is undervalued and will spike in the next couple months. Following this, the whales will dump these tokens as the price start to rise, leaving investors with tokens that are worth a lot less than what they paid for.  

Smaller investors are on the losing of this because they are not able to leverage on ground floor prices when the tokens are released.",1635141011,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qfa4wb/4_types_of_token_offering_scams_and_how_to_avoid/

63,CryptoCurrency,JDP-Phoenix,[Advice Sought] Please help me restructure my portfolio heading into 2022.,"Hi everyone,

I hope you're all having a lovely Monday. 

**A little bit about me:**

I'm a late twenties professional who intends to retire before I am 40. My cryptocurrencies forms the risk-on portion of my overall portfolio, and I'm hoping to achieve at least a 1,000% return over the next decade. While I've dabbled in cryptocurrencies for a while now, it wasn't until June of this year that I dove deep. Like many of you, I'm anticipating that the next six months will return life changing returns. Unfortunately work has been crazy of late, and will continue to be all throughout the next three or so months, so I will have very little time to focus on my portfolio.

**Help me restructure my portfolio:**

Given that I will have next to no time and energy to devout to my portfolio over the next three months, what changes would you make to my portfolio to maximise the return on what is essentially a 'fire and forget' strategy for the imminent future? Obviously it goes without saying that I am not seeking financial advice; just your opinion on whether my portfolio is primed to ride the exponential wave in the coming months. I have a week or so to do research on any last changes to my portfolio, before I have to set it in stone. So if you were me what changes (if any) would you make?

I don't see how governments in the future won't just put everyone on the centralized blockchain to reap all the practical benefits digital currency and smart contracts bring.

Another possibility, mass adoption of a decentralized platform by centralized powers, resulting in voting control over platform governance.

What about you?,"So I spend 3 hours explaining cryptocurrency to my parents today and they are extremely skeptical about it. I do not blame them as they are not updated to what is going on throughout and how it actually functions.

Just like the dot.com era, many of the older traditional did not believe in them and they did not want to update themself or change. However, look at where the internet is today. Almost everyone owns a laptop or phone with them.

Even though I spend multiple hours telling them about what is cryptocurrency, they were more intrigued by how much money they can make compared to their fixed deposits / mutual funds. 

I told them that USDC on crypto.com offers 12% APY which is close to 10x that of their bank savings account. That really sparkled their eyes to invest in Crypto. Honestly, I do not think that they are investing for the advancement of technology in crypto but because of the money.

— Buying Process:

Coinbase is the best starting point, Check if coin (remember SHIB, paid extra via CB wallet) is available on CB. If not, Try Coinbase Wallet. In rare circumstance, I would consider buying from another wallet.

Also, Check slippage before buying, CB wallet does not have a good way to check that. Use other wallets to cross check that and compare fee estimates too.

2. Zerion
3. Dharma

If Coin is not on CB then transfer ETH to CB Wallet and do a swap. Make sure coin is ERC20.

91,CryptoCurrency,AllenDo,token chain vs ethereum chain.,"From Coinbase Matic QA page, I see this

*Coinbase supports Polygon (MATIC) transactions via the Ethereum network.  Sending transactions via Polygon (MATIC) main-net will result in the  loss of funds.*  

Same apply to avax coin.....chain (avax is it's own block chain and sometimes called eth killer, but the c chain is on erc20?)

*Only send C-Chain Avalanche tokens to your Coinbase wallet address(es). C-Chain Avalanche addresses start with '0x'.  Sending Avalanche on P-chain or X-chain or any other assets to your  wallet address(es) will result in permanent loss.*

I kinda of understand that matic is an ethereim token (just like AVVE or LINK), but at the same time, matic has its own chain and I should differentiate these 2 situation.

93,CryptoCurrency,l1ftr1ck,A Better Way of Banking," 

Hey All,

I have this idea for a token on Cardano that will be used to integrate debt and assests into the blockchain. Adding Assests will greatly inflate the price of the token and although adding debt seams like a bad idea. Debt is actually a good thing as long as you dont have alot of it.

It will function like a Bank with the difference being anyone person who owns the tokens is basically considererd a ""owner"" and will get a say on how the systems upgrades and operates moving forward.

The main reason I want to do this is to take money and power away from institutions and banks and put it back into the hands of those who actually own it. The People!

Owning tokens will entitle you to monthly payments. (payments can be in fiat or crypto)

Using Governance we could also set up a system that allows for lending which would truly make it a bank by the people for the people.

Why would you put your money into a system that will then use that money against you. We have to put and end to this madness and greed.

We are all in this together. Lets start acting like it.

I have a much more detailed plan on how we can achieve this and I need more people to get involved.

I dont give a shit about money, I dont want any money for doing this. I want a better world for all of us. One where people at the top don't even have the option to fuck us.

28,CryptoCurrency,GarbageLeo,I just heard my cousin on the phone having a conversation about SHIB,"Purely from his responses, a friend of his who is ""deep"" into crypto was telling him about the recent spike in the price of SHIB. He sounded excited and from the sounds of it, his friend had come away with a pretty hefty profit.  


Now, don't get me wrong; I don't hate SHIB. I don't own any, never will, but that's a decision I've made for myself. My cousin's friend, however, is known to invest in shoddy coins/tokens and doesn't really have a basic understanding of crypto as a whole. My cousin has described him as ""Like a native american tracking buffalo, ears to the ground type sh\*t"" when it comes to crypto and I legitimately believe he told my cousin SHIB can lead to some immense gains when realistically, it can only 2x to 2.5x and even THAT is being generous. My cousin sounded exuberant, even going so far as to revive his long-dead Coinbase account in order to buy some. I'm real scared he's going to lose a lot of money but I'm pretty sure he trusts this friend way more than he trusts someone like me.  


I hated hearing this conversation because my cousin is a believer in memes and has stated that the Shiba Inu meme Doge is his favorite, and has also heavily invested in DOGE. He's also into TRX, VET and some other projects that haven't seen movement or progress in ages (obviously VET has become a leading enterprise blockchain but in terms of price movement) so it kinda worries me.

Bitcoin was worth $61,257 as of 5 p.m. Sunday, down 7% in the previous five days but up 43% in the previous month.

ETHUSD also approached its all-time high, topping $4,300 on Thursday, just shy of its previous high of $4,379.11 in May. On Sunday, the price of ether was $4,090.

According to di Florio, ether futures ETFs, which are also traded at CME, may be more predictable than spot bitcoin ETFs. ""Because it's about futures,"" di Florio explained. ""And it follows the same path that led to the SEC's approval of the Bitcoin futures ETF."" As a result, they are likely to benefit from the same regulatory relief.""

VanEck and ProShares both dropped their applications for ether futures ETFs two days after filing them in August. Some analysts speculated that the SEC contacted both issuers and indicated that ether-linked ETFs were unlikely to be approved, at least not before bitcoin-linked ETFs were approved.

This got me thinking how can blockchain solve any problems related to 'expensive' part? Since services would be decentralised it would have to adjust its price to global market and therefore would be no good solution which price-wise would be optimal for Swiss and Zimbabwe alike. Either services for poor people would be inacessible or rich people would be even more richer because of the cheaper prices for services. Most of cryto prophets seems to avoid explanation for that.

I don’t have many moons but I would like be able to sell them. 

I have a lot of interest in celesti.trade where they swap moons for XLM (which I actually really like). I’m not too informed on moons and understand they have potential but capitalizing on something that has value now and putting it into something I believe in sounds best to me.

SO, my problem is, when I access my vault and follow the procedure on Celesti, try to send me moons to their ethereum address... and nothing happens. No moons are sent and they are still in my vault. I can’t seem to move them either.

I tried awarded one to a comment and it didn’t not go through.

Website Shibaken.io

It is just what you think it is, tiny price of .0000000000349 or close, even being up 400% this month. 100quadrillion supply. New small project with one of the devs spreading the word on Twitter.

The potential: Recently created a bridge which allows it to be traded on pancakeswap, uniswap, and eth server.
Launched in April after being rescued.
Q4 ideas: farming, allowing people with dead coin or “rug pulled” projects to swap their coins into Shibaken for a second chance.

It really does have potential I believe but will need more support from the crypto community to launch on a CEX so for now it can only be bought on a few places, their website and YouTube videos give info about how to buy and convert with their bridge.

Also interesting it is a true deflationary coin where every transaction spreads 1% to holders and burns 1% of the total transaction.

Enjoy bashing it, ignoring it, or buying a few trillion. Whatever you choose if it runs 1,000% or 3,000,000% you can’t say nobody told you about it lol.

I was just wondering if anyone else posts or shit posts when they are on the toilet/bathroom/loo or dunny? 

I do and it feels good earning passive income on the dunny rather than ironically throwing money at shit coins.
Or would folks think of throwing more money at shit coins when on the dunny?
 
I guess along the same lines does anyone think of buying more Shiba or Doge coin if one owns a dog?

If you have any VET, would you have a pet? Maybe this is the coin for cat lovers? 

When your coin is about to go through a hard fork, do you look at your fork at dinner and want to buy more of that coin?

Doea anyone who sees the word 'LINK' automatically think 'Chainlink'? I do.

88,CryptoCurrency,druk_ware,The Ugly Side of Launchpads,"Hi Crypto community. I have something to say about most launchpads. Please correct me if I'm wrong. 

If you're unfamiliar with launchpads, here's a breakdown: 

Essentially, launchpads help crypto projects get initial funding from the general public. There is a whitelisting process selected at random in most cases, so not everyone gets to get in on a project early. **BUT, EVERYONE HAS THE SAME CHANCE TO GET IN.**

======================================================================

Let's take DAOmaker as an example. 

I found DAOmaker in February 2021, after they pivoted from a social mining platform to a platform whose core message was *""Venture Capital Re-Created for the Masses""* platform. 

Their DAO token was used as an entry to participate in the whitelisting process known as Strong Holder Offering. Projects could choose who they wanted to grant entry to, and participants could be refunded if the projects tank. **Sounds pretty fair, right? To me, it was.** 

(I'm sure they had some kind of advantage for users with more DAO tokens, but it was still generally more leveled than it is today.)

Come September 1st, 2021, when they introduced the new tiered system: 

&gt;Tranche 0:   
&gt;  
&gt;500 - 1,999 DAO “Early Adopters” Winning Chance 1.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 1:    
&gt;  
&gt;2,000 - 3,999 DAO Winning Chance 4.67  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 2:    
&gt;  
&gt;4,000 - 9,999 DAO Winning Chance 9.76  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 3:    
&gt;  
&gt;10,000+ DAO Winning Chance 26  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 4:    
&gt;  
&gt;25,000+ DAO Winning Chance 69.5  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 5:    
&gt;  
&gt;50,000+ DAO Winning Chance 149  
&gt;  
&gt;""Early adopters"" refers to all users, who had a minimum of 500 DAO staked in the Vaults before September 1st, 2021 and kept it staked.   
&gt;  
&gt;All new entries are required 2,000 DAO in their Wallets for SHO participation. Winning chances mean increased winning chance to tranche 0. For example tranche 3 has required 20 times more DAO, but provides 26 times higher winning chances. It, therefore, provides a boost of 6x chance.

======================================================================

I'll admit, I bought into the new tiered system and got myself 2,000 DAO power.

**But, I still think what DAOmaker (and lots of other launchpads) is doing now goes against what they used to stand for:** ***To give retail investors a chance to join ICOs and presales even though they don't have the capital like institutional investors (I.E. VENTURE CAPITALISM RE-CREATED FOR THE MASSES).***

Tonnes of people get into crypto for a chance to get out of the rat race of earning low-middle income and live a peaceful leanFIRE life. 2,000 DAO at the peak is $17,500 (considered ATH: $8.75). That's way more than what a lot of people save per year. And they can't even use that money to invest in ICOs because it's stuck as DAO power. Then, they still have to scrounge another 200-500 BUSD which they don't have. Imagine buying at the ATH and losing $11,800 (using today's price of $2.85). Sounds a little unfair to me. 

On top of that, people with 50,000 DAO power essentially dominate the SHOs with 149 chances of winning an entry. Compared to the real O.G.s who stayed from the beginning who only have 1 pathetic chance of winning with 500 DAO power. 

In other words, the $142,500 is more likely to make another $10k with an entry to an ICO (or whatever IDO IEO nonsense) than someone with $1,425.  

DAOmaker is becoming the problem it was trying to solve. **What was once a leveled playing field where everyone had the same chance to win is now** ***peak capitalism––the exact problem crypto is trying to solve.*** 

It doesn't matter if everyone has a small chance to win. It's leveled. It's crypto. Deal with it. 

If you're some rich dude who wants an edge, then ask your rich dad for investment opportunities over at Lord Farquard's private equity firm and get off crypto. 

This also goes for any other launchpads with tiered entries like DuckStarter etc. 

I get that DAOmaker wants to make big bucks. Stop making crypto like high finance and capitalism and elitist. Then, stop labeling yourself as ""for the retailers"" and call it as it is. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

(P.S. Props to Binance who has kept launchpads fair for all its users.) 

(P.P.S. Not affiliated, but if you're interested in getting into presales without the help of launchpads, [ICOdrops.com](https://ICOdrops.com) has a pretty great list of upcoming projects. Some don't hold their presales on these launchpads.)",1635133393,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf89t7/the_ugly_side_of_launchpads/

The entire crypto market cap is 2.7 trillion . The entire market cap of JUST Apple stock alone is 2.5 trillion. Think about that. 1 public company is bigger than all of crypto currency combined. Now when you factor in the ENTIRE stock market and bank economy , you realize how small crypto currently is. We are still very early. It’s LESS than 1% of total currency and markets. That’s still 100x opportunity to grow from an overall perspective. We’re only in the IBM days of where crypto currency can be at when you think of how the computer and internet exploded.

12,CryptoCurrency,Badmac1388,Crypto Boomer thoughts,"As a Boomer I was at first very skeptical on crypto then in 2019 a young co-worker got me to sign up for Blockfolio ( now FTX ) and I got 50 dollars worth if free ETH was .25 ETH at the time and promptly forgot about it. About 5 months ago the same co-worker said I should check out my ETH I saw it was over 1000.00. Long story short I was hooked.

The biggest barrier for me was the technology first was doing KYC for the exchange I joined and figuring  how to use wallets and move my coins around the blockchain without losing any. I have decent computer skills but it was still a steep learning curve for me and I feel that is one of the reasons less people my age even try to invest in crypto. I am sure some boomers  hear about the returns that are possible but have not even heard of the blockchain let alone understand it.

 So i bought a couple books Bubble or Revolution and the Infinite machine. Listened to podcasts and watched YouTube videos. I also bought near the ATH and was shocked by my first big Dip last summer  luckily I had joined this Subreddit where I learned FOMO which I had just been guilty of, also Hodling and Staking and the strategy to DCA which I did during the last dip. And also  don't trust anyone and take all advice with a grain of salt and most importantly DYOR.I am now up 57 % so thank you to this community for the education i received here.

When I try to talk to anyone my age about the possibilities of DeFi ( after I explain DeFi to them ) they shrug me off  i think some of them can not even grasp the concept or implications of it. I try to explain that I am making 5 to 12 % staking on my coins  (after trying to explain what Staking is to them ) its way better then the banks and how much I am up ( that could change in a day ) but they just roll their eyes. And unfortunately most of them probably couldn't figure it out or even try. On the other hand I can talk crypto to my children and younger co-workers as alot of them are into crypto and I like getting all techno with them.

Let's hope I get this question explained correctly and it probably exists on many platforms but I have only seen it on kucoin.  I'll use an exact example.

I'm trying to trade coin ERG.  I see there is an open order in the buy section for $9 and 800 coins are in the open order.  Because ERG is traded in relatively low volume the order has been there for a while.  I make a decision to place an order for the exact value of the open order.  That order disappears before my order is executed.  

I would say that this is just a coincidence but it's happened numerous times.  The open order withdraws their order before my order is excited so I'm certain that something is gaming the system where likely arbitrage bots can likely see an order come in before it's executed and can pull the bot order.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The idea behind Ethereum is ingenious: Connect computers from all over the world to build the most decentralized world-computer possible. However, we also all have seen the problems of the current, monolithic “one blockchain fits all” solution: Exploding fees, clogged network, long processing times and subsequently slow adoption in the real-world. You have all heard about Ethereum layer 2 solutions like Elrond or Polygon. But have you ever considered to solve Ethereums problems by seeing it as a second layer of an even more fundamental network?  
&gt;  
&gt;This is exactly the strategy the IOTA foundation revealed with its recent IOTA smart contract protocol (ISCP) beta release.  
&gt;  
&gt;They made the unique decision to have smart contracts not as a part of their feeless base-layer (the “Tangle”), but instead as a second layer solution. Each smart contract is one individual blockchain and is run by its own committee of nodes. This committee performs all smart contract computations internally and connects to the IOTA main-layer to create and send digital assets (NFTs, wrapped tokens, etc.) IOTA tokens and to communicate seamlessly with all other IOTA smart contract chains.  
&gt;  
&gt;This layout allows IOTA smart contracts to be extremely flexible in design, different for each usecase and each user, while bein extremely scalable. It is the antithesis of the “one blockchain fits all” paradigm, a true cooperative multi-blockchain environment.  
&gt;  
&gt;**IOTA smart contract chain can choose freely between:**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Permissionless** (for high decentralization) **or permissioned** (for trusted consortia) validators  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **PoW, PoS, PoX** or any other consensus mechanism  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Being feeless or getting paid in any currency** (outside of the network in fiat or other crypto currencies, with a currency minted inside your IOTA smart contract blockchain (i.e. ETH) or with the native IOTA token)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Creating own internal tokens** (IOTA smart contract chains are complete blockchains after all)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Communicate feeless and seamlessly with other SCs over the IOTA Tangle.** You can interact with other smart contracts, build complex multi-SC networks and send around data, L2 tokens (i.e. ETH) or IOTA-based L1 token to every other connected SC chain.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Control IOTA tokens and IOTA digital assets on the Tangle**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Use any programming language you want** (currently supported Rust, Go and **Solidity (Ethereum virtual machine)**, many more languages and bridges planned).  
&gt;  
&gt;As you can see, IOTA smart contracts can be made in any way any company, government, DeFi developer, game-designer or private person would want them. It is a completely open playing field, a sandbox, ready to be flooded with ideas and use-cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The role of Ethereum in the IOTA smart contracts eco-system (“Apes together strong”)**  
&gt;  
&gt;IOTA is not an Ethereum-killer, it is an Ethereum enabler.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum is plagued by unpredictable fees and a clogged network because every single Banano -&gt; Squirtle-coin swap needs to be processed by this literal world-computer. Every crypto-kitty, gambling-app or other fun little smart-contract project today gets secured with the insane levels of hash-power a literal world-computer has to offer and in turn becomes slow and expensive. Yes, there is a thing as having TO MUCH security for your crypto application and your latest gambling roulette or smart-neighborhood application in a suburb of Buenos Aires is a prime example for that.  
&gt;  
&gt;All these smaller and mid-size use-cases can now migrate onto the IOTA Tangle (IOTA 2.0 DevNet for now, mainnet next year) by creating their own, individual smart contract chains. Decentralized finance can for example be performed by smaller consortia using proof of stake on an individual smart contract chain. Gaming apps can be processed by just some dozens of validators instead of hundreds of thousands. Both speed and costs of DEXes would improve DRAMATICALLY – no more 100$ swaps that take one hour! We are talking DeFi happening in seconds and for the cost of mere cents.  
&gt;  
&gt;**So what´s the role of Ethereum here?**  
&gt;  
&gt;In this new context Ethereum can be seen the most decentralized and highest security IOTA smart contract chain possible. It will be the go-to solution for REALLY high stake smart contracts like high value life-insurances or large real-estate trades.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum gains from being part of IOTA smart contract landscape:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- High reliability and use-ability for high-value use-cases because it is less clogged by smaller projects and games  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Seamless communication with ALL OTHER smart contracts on IOTA, even those which are impossible on Ethereum as of today (such as permissioned smart contracts by industry consortia)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- A more diversified and therefore decentralized crypto-landscape, no single point-of-failure  
&gt;  
&gt;Growth of the cryptocurrency space can only happen when technology evolves and projects work together – not “kill” each other. This is now possible in a previously unknown new direction: Not by adding second layers on top of Ethereum, but instead adding a “**Layer 0**” solution under its feet.",1635129350,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf75ts/layer_0_the_real_reason_why_dominik_schiener/

61,CryptoCurrency,Ninja_Vagabond,Is it too late for SHIB?,"So, I’m not a big fan of meme coins. I get that they’re a way for people to get familiar with crypto. I saw some of my first crypto gains from Doge, so I’m not throwing stones. Glass houses and all. 

I’m genuinely curious about SHIB, it has zero utility that I can see, and it making huge gains, but the chart is not typical of a shitcoin rugpull. 

It’s really interesting to see how much money is being spent on this project. The daily amount of SHIB traded has blown away other meme/shit coins and has created a new pattern that doesn’t follow any other. 

I’m not a fan of shitcoins, but I’m man enough to admit I don’t know shit. 

So I’m asking, genuinely, is it too late to get in on SHIB, or are we still early? 

I’m holding a very small part of my portfolio, gambling money, in SHIB. It’s fun watching it ride.

Gox is about to distribute $10 Billion worth of Bitcoin to its creditors. Mt. Gox has also caused huge crashes previously. Like in February 2014 when Mt. Gox announced that approximately 850,000 bitcoins belonging to customers and the company were missing and likely stolen or like in 2011 when the price of one Bitcoin dropped to 1 cent due to fraudulent trades.

This really seems like the perfect opportunity to get some cash ready for anything that might occur after Mt. Gox dumps 144,000 BTC. I'm not spreading FUD, but I'm expecting some sort of a correction in the Bitcoin market as 144,000 BTC is a huge amount of Bitcoin. I'm ready for anything that might happen though.

83,CryptoCurrency,Sopongebob123,I joined a two minute crusade of a pump'n'dump Telegram group so you don't have to. Here's what I've learnt.,"I think I found that group randomly on Instagram where they have just a couple of followers but when I checked their Telegram, I was quite shocked to see 150k members there. As I try to experience all the possible things you can do in the crypto space, I naturally joined to see how that process work. Here is a short summary of the annoying journey. 

&amp;#x200B;

**When?**

The group doesn't allow any comments besides their own announcements. These announcements have a very simple order. They tell you when will the next pump happen and then they send several reminders as you're getting closer to the pump day. I think that they do these pumps around 2-3 times per week or something like every three days.

&amp;#x200B;

**How?**

There is a set time for when the pump starts. On the exact time and day it was planned, the announcement will display a simple message that just states the specific token's symbol. That seems to always happen at 6pm UK time and at the very second this happens, the price skyrockets. That only lasts for about a minute. For another minute the price hovers around the same high price and then it starts to drop hard basically to the pre-pump price. The owners of the group state something like that they ""hold the pump for two minutes to attract outside investors"", but I think that's just a clever statement how to screw over a lot of people. I will come back to this in the conclusion below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Where?**

So all of this happens at Hotbit exchange which I've never used before and it just look so bad. I'm sure there is a very good (shady) reason why the pump group uses this exchange but I don't know the details so feel free to expand on this!

&amp;#x200B;

**My own experience**

I prepared around 28 USDT and sent it to Hotbit (I did that by swapping it around with XLM to save on gas fees). I had the Exchange tab at Hotbit ready and Telegram opened on my phone, waiting for the ""signal"". As soon as the token symbol was revealed, I typed it to the search tab and tried to swap all my USDT as the price was immediately climbing high too fast. The price per token before the pump was $0.0038. My trade went through 19 seconds after the pump started when the price already grew 1000% to $0.039! I didn't really know what to do because the interface of Hotbit is so bad but I knew if I will hold longer than another few seconds, I will be screwed. I quickly sold everything at $0.051 (highest point of the pump was $0.06) making around $10 profit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Sounds good? Actually not at all! It only took few seconds for the price to reach the top which means if your trade goes through just a little bit late, you will buy at the top and watch your money lose 10x of its value in the next minute. Obviously there must be a shit ton of people who already know which coin will be pumped and all the small flies like me only help them to pump it more. I think that the statement about ""attracting outside investors"" is just bs because the price wouldn't drop back to the original value if there were more people outside of the group buying.

If you want to play around and risk with your money, this is a fun thing to try out but remember you can easily end up with $100 worth of shitcoin after putting in $1000. You will definitely never be able to buy fast enough to get those 1100% profits so don't let that blind you. I was super lucky and got out with like 30% profit? I'm sure that's just because I put in a small amount of USDT. Was that like 10k USDT, the trade might have been executed at the top and I would turn into a clown 🤡

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you and if there is any total shit out there that you want me to try out with my, now $38, I will be more than happy to try it out so you don't have to!",1635128065,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf6szk/i_joined_a_two_minute_crusade_of_a_pumpndump/
87,CryptoCurrency,OfficialNewMoonville,Guide: Getting Started in the Fantom Ecosystem,"Fantom has been one of the outstanding emerging stars since the summer, and has already more than 10Xed since August. With the Fantom Developer Conference currently getting started in Dubai, and a real possibly of some big Halloween pumps on the horizon, I'd like to introduce the Fantom ecosystem and hopefully help some people who are getting started for the first time. 

# Why Fantom? 

There is a lot to like about Fantom, but one of the main draws at the moment seems to be the ultra-low gas fees and super fast transaction speeds. Fantom represents a great alternative for retail investors to get started in DeFi, given the current cost barriers for the average investor in the Ethereum network. Earlier this year Fantom transfers and smart contact interactions cost less than a cent to approve. Despite the gas fees rising substantially since then, as the network gains in popularity and Fantom moons, you can still make transactions for pennies. 

Most importantly, Fantom enabled retail investors to actually use their coins. Gas fees are *absurdly cheap* and *wicked fast*. Right now they are the highest they've ever been and it still cost less than ten cents to move stuff around. Usually it costs pennies.

# Where Can I Buy Fantom? 

Fantom is currently avaliable on Binance, KuCoin, FTX, Gemini, SushiSwap, Crypto.com, and many other exchanges. Not listed on CoinBase yet but it seems like it is only a matter of time. 

If you buy Fantom on Binance you can move your coins off of the exchange and to your private wallet for the low low cost of 0.01 FTM.

# The Official Fantom Wallet 

You can get the [Official Fantom Wallet here.](https://fantom.foundation/wallets/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_yuxqSPn39nlYkpMJspC_u4bKDepvZww_IaApnN5v.4I-1633646961-0-gqNtZGzNAfujcnBszQj9) Might look a bit old-school at the moment but this is still V1 and it is rumored to be getting an upgrade very soon, possibly to be announced this week at the Fantom Developer Conference. Official Fantom Wallet allows you to stake your FTM for some pretty impressive staking rewards (can be 10% plus if you don't mind looking it for a significant period). 

# Configuring MetaMask 

[This blog post here](https://www.weirdo.rocks/blog/tutorial-how-to-setup-fantom-ftm-on-metamask-and-get-started#toc-add-the-fantom-opera-network-to-your-metamask) enables you to set up your MetaMask wallet to join the Fantom Ecosystem in a relatively easy and painless procedure. 

**Step 1: Log in to your Metamask **

Login as usual. 


**Step 2: Select Custom RPC **


**Step 3: Fill the fields and Save **


 Network Name: Fantom Opera 

• New RPC Url: https://rpcapi.fantom.network 

• ChainID: 250 

• Symbol: FTM 

• Block Explorer URL: https://ftmscan.com/ 


**Step 4: Send Yourself Some Fantom **

# SpookySwap (BOO) 

Right now the undisputed star of the Fantom eco-system is [SpookySwap](https://spookyswap.finance/), an all-in-one DEX that allows users to swap tokens, provide liquidity, yield farm, stake their tokens and bridge tokens between the Fantom network and others. SpookySwap is also releasing an official NFT collection at the end of this month, if that is your thing. 

The Native SpookySwap token, BOO, has a max supply of 13,600,000, of which more than half are already circulating. It is currently ranked 396th by MarketCap, according to CoinGecko. BOO can be staked on the SpookySwap app with APRs in the 34-54% range, with 23.15% APR made in BOO and a further variable amount paid in a token of your choosing (I get an extra 19.9% paid in DAI). 

If SpookySwap doesn't grab you, maybe take a look at [Spirit Swap, the SpookySwap rival.](https://app.spiritswap.finance/)

# Tarot 

Tarot is a decentralized lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers in isolated lending pools. By supplying the pools in Tarot you can get APRs of up to 30% on FTM (as of right now), and up to 120% on the Native token Tarot, which can count Andre Cronje and [Vitalik Buterin himself](https://mobile.twitter.com/Jacktheoiler/status/1451140690734321669?s=20) among the current users.

Tarot has a market cap of less than $25,000,000 right now, despite $200,000,000+ in Total Value Locked on Tarot right now. 

The project is still in its early days, so if the UI doesn't grab you, you can try alternatives such as Abracadabra (SPELL) and Mushrooms.Finance (MM).

# The Future 

Fantom is a very new and rapidly evolving ecosystem, so there is a lot more to discover, including NFT platforms, staking and yield farming solutions, the works. In my opinion the best thing about using the Fantom Network right now is being able to discover DeFi without paying Ethereum prices. Although it is certainly a bit harder than buying coins to leave on exchanges and speculate with, it has really opened my eyes to what is possible when we actually use our coins and move them around. 

Good luck getting started. And credit to u/JasonLuxton and u/TonyBarnaby for getting me started on the Fantom Ecosystem myself.

89,CryptoCurrency,Diatery,"Mexico's Guadalajara is rewarding citizens with 1:1 peso-pegged stablecoin for using public transport, cycling, and onboarding businesses to it's pilot program App/Wallet called Hoozies","Irish company Domila Limited is working with the University of Guadalajara on a pilot crypto project called Hoozies, which has legit ties to the IEEE as part of a 5G Smart Cities initiative. It's unclear how many businesses are participating on the pilot program, but the press release says over 1,800 users have signed up for the Hoozie app (Android, iOS) and 1.2 million pesos have been contributed for it's development.  

Here's how it works:

&gt;Hoozies can also be earned through the use of public transport, running and cycling. Riding a bike for 30 minutes, for example, earns a hoozie app user 10 hoozies. People get 50 hoozies if they sign up a friend to the app and 100 if they sign up a business.  
&gt;  
&gt;When people use the digital currency to make purchases in participating businesses, 4% of the value of the transaction is returned to them in hoozies.

It also works as a P2P / B2B app where you can sell your services and pay people directly through the app. There's some cashback campaigns for flocking to participating businesses.

What's unclear is what blockchain technology is under the hood, and whether or not we'll see Hoozies on exchanges any time soon.  Here's the most technical thing I could find about it: 

"" This project is promoted by the quadruple helix, composed by the SICyT through the COECYTJAL; by the technological firm HP, the Office of Visitors and Conventions (OFVC), ANTAD, the University of Guadalajara (UdeG), the innovation ecosystem of the European community represented by the company DOMILA LTD (Ireland), as well as by international associations as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE IoT Smart Cities), being the world's largest organization in technology.  ""

Furthermore, in an interview the project leader Joel Myers said Hoozies technically isn't a cryptocurrency since it is pegged to the local currency... which is interesting. That reminds me of all of those godforsaken 90's internet payment dot-com bombs like Beenz and Flooz, which failed miserably.  You'd think they'd have consulted UrbanDictionary first, which has a colorful alternative definition. However, in a different interview Myers also says it uses blockchain technology. So which is it? This is like a more well thought-out version of El Salvador, but more centralized and dorky but wholesome.

My biggest hesitation is the one I see over and over, which is the risk of a CeFi platform going under, getting hacked, or if the stable coin somehow fails. 

All of these seem like great use cases for smart contracts. If I could buy insurance, and give a percentage of my earnings to the smart contract on a weekly basis, I'd be much more comfortable with moving more of my money into CeFi platforms. Hell I might be willing to ditch my banks entirely if my funds could be secured. 

Not only would this increase crypto accumulation (which would help be a springboard for crypto as a widely accepted payment method), it would also increase real world adoption of smart contracts and the blockchains those are built on.

This is based off of Dogecoin’s previous market cap high of 80 Billion Dollars, that it reached back earlier this year. The bullrun has continued and Shiba Inu has overtaken Dogecoin in terms of popularity. Based on social media metrics, Shiba Inu is now one of the most popular cryptocurrencies with more mentions on Reddit and Twitter than Dogecoin (SHIB Gets More Mentions on Twitter Than Bitcoin, Ethereum, DOGE - ELEVENEWS).

There’s no reason Shiba can’t rise to Doge’s previous all time market cap high. The market cap for the whole crypto space is also expected to reach 10 Trillion Dollars by 2023 (https://bitcoinist.com/usd-10-trillion-total-crypto-market-cap/) and it currently stands at 2.55 Trillion. Going by some simple math. An all time Shiba MC high of $80 billion x 4x(Entire MC growth by 2023), we could see .0008 per coin within 2 years.

This is just based off of optimistic fundamental conditions that have occurred with Doge and could possibly happen with expected market growth.

The real hopium is where people may FOMO in the crypto space and Shiba makes it to the top 5 coins. If that were to happen that I don’t see why .001 wouldn’t be possible within a year. The growth and speed of growth of cryptocurrency is accelerating so quickly. Community burns of Shiba combined with people locking up their coin supply (by staking) could accelerate the price and market cap increase.

This is all incredibly optimistic thinking but it’s possible. If a pizza 12 or so years ago now costs $700 million, anything could happen... ;-)",1635125601,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf63nr/shiba_could_potentially_reach_a_320_billion_mc_by/
44,CryptoCurrency,AjScharni1,Getting started in crypto,"This last week I had turned 18 and decided to start investing my money in stocks and crypto currencies. I am a freshmen in college with no current mode of income. Other than the money that I have already invested I have a little over 2,000 in a checking account that I want to invest(I do not need this money for necessities, all of it can be invested).

With my current situation I set up a Coinbase pro account. I am using Coinbase pro because I had read the fees would be cheaper than a standard Coinbase account. I plan to invest about 20-50 every week or every other week in stable coins like ETH and BTC. Correct me if I am wrong but this is what I have come to understand as dollar cost averaging and is a relatively safe investment strategy - feel free to critique.

In addition to the Coinbase pro account I know I also need a wallet, although I am not exactly sure why.

If you have any recommendations for a wallet that I should set up please let me know why it is necessary. Also any input regarding my investment strategy would be greatly appreciated. I plan to have an internship next semester and will be sure to change my investment strategy then when I have a consistent mode of income, but until then this is what I am planning on doing.",1635123749,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf5kfv/getting_started_in_crypto/
48,CryptoCurrency,Nervous_Sky_5167,One of the top posts about crypto supply centralization is misleading and outright lying.,"Tl;dr: The post talking about crypto supply centralization and how only a minute minority own a vast majority of coins is extremely misleading. They go on to claim how this is a 'core principle of economics' and how coin supply centralization is an incredibly precise indicator. Not to mention the title is full of spelling mistakes...

If you haven't seen what I mean, here's their post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qetjrx/the\_terrifying\_of\_totaly\_supply\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qetjrx/the_terrifying_of_totaly_supply_of/)

Now here's why coin supply centralization doesn't dictate everything about a coin:

**Selective Age Bias** \- As a cryptocurrency gets older and more mature, supply is offloaded from whales to other people. That is how basic money flow works. As time passes on, supply tends to get more evened out as that select cryptocurrency gets most expensive to accumulate, both from a literal and opportunity cost standpoint. This is why the cryptocurrencies that are older tend to have less coin supply centralization (i.e. ETH or the oldest of them all, BTC).

**Selective Exchange Bias** \- Another part of selective bias comes from exchanges. Older and more established cryptocurrencies tend to have more self-custody audiences (i.e. ETH or BTC). Newer or more speculative cryptocurrencies tend to exist mainly on exchange accounts, which show up as one centralized wallet (i.e. SHIB).

**Pseudo-anonymity** \- Most cryptocurrency wallets have no name or organization name, but despite the open-blockchain aspect, are known as 'pseudo-anonymous networks. Because of this, you cannot know whether the whale wallet you're looking at is a *centralized exchange wallet (i.e. Coinbase), fund wallet (i.e. private funds),* or an actual *personal* wallet (*my wallet)*. You also don't know whether a single person owns multiple wallets, their balances spread across them all in order to deter suspicion, or if multiple people own a single wallet (i.e. multi-sig wallet). 

I'm not here to root for any specific cryptocurrency. I just want to prove the facts, facts that the previous OP glossed over. There's a reason why the examples I just listed are mostly under *selective bias* psychology, and that's because the previous OP was probably cherry-picking details to mastermind his own ideals. 

It's kinda sad how that post was up-voted to high heaven since nobody really took any care in analyzing the details. Speaks volume of our echo-chamber subreddit.",1635123562,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf5icv/one_of_the_top_posts_about_crypto_supply/
50,CryptoCurrency,alivellani,Do your crypto accounting!,"Just knowing how much of a coin you have is not enough. 

Everybody who invests in crypto should atleast make an excel sheet and note down every time you make a purchase.
Some fields could be

1. Date of purchase
2. Qty coins bought
3. Rate of the coin
4. Misc charges like fees etc
5. Total cost = ( rate * qty) + misc charges of the purchase.

Once you have this basic data you can make all sort of charts and summary sheets. 

I was surprised to know how some people either
A. Rely on their exchange to provide this information. Or
B. Have just an approximate in their head with no proper data.

52,CryptoCurrency,InevitableSoundOf,A typical NFT grift: The Influencer/Celebrity Special,"So NFT's have really taken off this year, and it's not unusual to hear about traders moving into the nft space because that's where the real money is. Fair enough, and each unto their own, but I'd thought I'd share a typical grift NFT market places use to maximize profits.

Person A, let's call them Shill9000. A 200k subscriber Youtuber, a typical Crypto Bro that even though preachers people need to be careful somehow still claims they're selling their bags for a new crypto project every week.

Person B, let's call them RealShady. A large NFT marketplace or crypto entity that has basically an endless supply of NFT.

RealShady needs more profits. They reach out to Shill9000 and say hey if you just advertise buying and selling a specific NFT for us we will give you 20k, and if it goes well expect this to be ongoing.

Shill9000 goes yeah sure, I like money.

RealShady sends 100k in whatever coin to Shill9000 with instructions to buy NotWorthADollar NFT. Shill9000 makes a new video with them buying a NFT for 100k (forgets to mention it's not with his money, or that the seller is RealShady). Cue cringe YouTube thumbnail. Shill9000 then makes a new video of them selling said NFT for 120k!!! Needless to say the video gets alot of views.

RealShady meanwhile has just brought NotWorthADollar NFT back for 120k through an unconnected account. Effectively giving Shill9000 a 20k payment. What they have also done is convinced a large amount of people that these types of NFT's are worth alot of money and more importantly that you can quickly sell them for a nice windfall.

Those watchers through no fault of their own now talk to friends and social media and the news further spreads. ""Hey I have inside information that X style NFT is where the money is at"".

Now RealShady sits back and watches as most of them get snapped up. Most for a much lower price then 120k but that's part of the con, as they aren't worth anything so convincing people 2k is cheap is the win. All of them being owned by them until the copycats arrive means RealShady has made alot more than 20k it cost to engineer the hype. 

In the hype some can be easily sold for the ridiculous price but in a month or two alot of people will be just bag holders with unprofitable NFT's.

RealShady then starts it all over again.

I don't have anything against NFT's but you just need to be aware of the space. I'm sure some people make money but yeah these engineered buy and sells are definitely a common occurrence in the space.

I hope it helps.",1635123039,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf5cr3/a_typical_nft_grift_the_influencercelebrity/

A friend of mine that has been investing for some years is showing me everything I need to know. 

But he also plays some crypto games (or nft games, ifk the right terminology for it) and says can so be a good deal.

For me, it looks like a scam (the websites, gameplay, streams, all seem fishy). I know it's really not a scam, cause my friend gets money from it. 
But idk if it's something I should dip my toes into, or run away from.

You guys probably know of the existence of these games, the most famous (I think) being Axie Infinity. It had a huge impact in the Philippines, made the news, etc. 

Before trying anything, I'd like to know the opinion of the community here about it. Do u guys acknowledge it, play it, hate it, despise it...?

60,CryptoCurrency,crua9,USA Gridbot traders and wash sell,"So something that appears to be within the rules at this second but is talk about being against the rules possibly next year on. It's using wash sells to deduct from taxes. Note there is no clear answer if prior wash sells before the ruling will be allowed to use as a deduction or if they wont count for future deductions.

Anyways, what is a wash sell. More than less it is when you sell at a loss, and then rebuy within 30 days.

So where does this link to grid bots. If you're on LIFO then this doesn't matter. But since places like koinly, CoinTracker, and other places do a universal LIFO or FIFO. This most likely is a problem for the many. Like if you can find a tracker that let's you change it per sell then let me know.

Anyways, how a grid bot works is basically you have an upper and lower limit. You sat per grid buy/sell x amount of coins (for example 100 coins). And it does it. When it moves up and crosses grids it sells and it buys as it moves down.

Now the problem comes in when let's say $5 it buys $4 it buy $3 and $2. Then it goes from $2 to $3 and it sells. With FIFO the tax will look at it as you sold the coins you bought at $5. So it will be a loss. And now the price drop back to $2. Now it bought and this is where your wash sell came in.

(what makes it worse when it hits $5 it will have a massive gain. So this means you will pay taxes on massive gains while having massive losses. And if the wash sell rule is in place, you can't deduct any of the loss. Which means you now have a major major tax bill. But even if the wash rule isn't in place. You can only deduct $3k a year. And this means you again are stuck paying a ton more in taxes than you should.)


I learned this the hard way. This problem looks like it will cost me about 3 to 4 times more in taxes than I should've. But since I'm poor and can't afford a CPA. I'm pretty much screwed.


But note giving the wash sell rule never takes place and you make enough to pay for everything including a good cpa. I think this is worth it still. But for us poor folks. Idk

5,CryptoCurrency,RatherCynical,"Why this subreddit doesn't really like ""investing"" in shitcoins","With another dog-based meme-coin reaching new ATHs and entering #10 soon, this post is a reminder that meme-based shitcoins aren't actually investing. It's much, much closer to gambling.

If the hype dies down, and the floor gives out, there isn't really a limit on how hard the price can fall. There are not enough buyers on the other side when the whales have made their money and decide to cash out. It's pretty cool for early investors to make a lot of money, but there will be many more ""investors"" who end up holding the bag.

God forbid, if you hold it through a 2018-style bear market, your bag could be an eternal bag.

If a shitcoin has a 95% chance of doing nothing - or worse - losing you money, and it has a 5% chance of giving you 1,000% returns, then overall your ""expected returns"" are 1,000% x 5% = 50%. You'd be much better off just buying and holding/staking some BTC and ETH.

There is a place for speculation within a portfolio. If you speculated with 10% of a portfolio on DOGE at $0.002, you would've made tremendous returns. Just never go all-in. There are much better projects out there that have a much better risk/reward profile.

First and foremost Reddit thank you for hearing me out. [u/johnny\_kucoin](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnny_kucoin/) Has responded to my post and I have also followed up.

I am going to share all the details with you as I am not going to censor them to paint a picture for myself.

For what it's worth. I want to be wrong, and I love Kucoin. I feel betrayed by their actions and I tried to give them every chance to explain their actions. This resulted in me finally bringing my concerns to their own subreddit and they insta banned me ending a 2-month debacle of inquiries.

On a positive note, they have since lifted my ban on [r/kucoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/kucoin/) since the post blew up a bit

I think it's important to hear out Kucoin and the team. this is not a witch hunt.

Sadly

They dont ever address the issues.

Cloud flare is an industry tool and the most widely used Edge Network service. Under normal circumstances it is great, but like any tool, it can be weaponized

I do believe this is what's happening here.

It seems they want to talk about how everyone uses Cloudflare and how much they spend on AWS (amazon)

I do know for a fact other exchanges do the same thing, and if and when it comes up I will do the exact same thing to those exchanges but only when I have sufficient material to present.

Additionally, Johnny Lyu says he doesn't know why I got banned but guesses ""maybe spamming?""

If he went and looked at my post history for 34 seconds he would know that is very much not true.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is his PM to ME as follows:

[u/johnny\_kucoin](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnny_kucoin/)

Noted. Will discuss with the team

Also, noticed on the post you created. Here's our response FYI

Thanks for raising your question about KuCoin. As the People’s Exchange, we always pursue user satisfaction. Regarding the issues you mentioned, we are very willing to discuss them openly and transparently.

Firstly, Cloudflare is a world-renowned CDN solution. As you said, one of its main functions is to prevent DDoS attacks, which is also our main purpose for deploying it. Currently, almost all major exchanges are working closely with Cloudflare.

All exchanges have applied an access frequency limit through Cloudflare to ensure the stability of their services. Once the limit has been surpassed, denial of website access may occur. When setting the limit, we discussed thoroughly with high-frequency traders, like API traders, for instance, before concluding on the limit. We believe that in most cases, the frequency limit will not affect our users. But it is possible that, when there’s a big price move or someone visits the site too frequently, 504 pages may still appear due to the limitation. We have been working on improving this for a while, and if you encountered such an issue, we would appreciate it if you could share the RAY ID from the 504 pages with our support team so that we can better solve the problem. Thank you.

Secondly, regarding the AWS server, KuCoin invests a lot in IT infrastructure and network security. Compared with other exchanges of our size and scale, our investment in AWS servers is almost twice as much as theirs. And we will continue to invest in this sector as we know this is one of the fundamentals of our services.

In fact, as a platform, we care about usability and stability more than anyone else. The access issue will not only impact KuCoin's revenue but also affect user experience. As a platform dedicated to building itself and the industry for the long term, we know that reputation is everything. We hope that all users can trade with KuCoin easily and pleasantly, achieve their investment goals, and even improve their lives. As a neutral platform, we do not profit from users' liquidation. Therefore, we are constantly introducing new functions and educating users to help them manage their futures positions properly and reduce the risk of liquidation.

Having noticed that you’ve been banned in the KuCoin Subreddit, I am checking with the team for the reason, but our current guess is due to spamming. We have unbanned your account. All opinions are welcomed in our community, no matter if they are positive or negative. We are very sorry for the inconvenience. As for the Moderator List you claimed that we made private, actually we didn’t change any setting on that. It’s likely because banned users cannot see it. Please check again since you are now unbanned.

Since its establishment in 2017, we have experienced many ups and downs, but KuCoin always believes in the future of crypto. So, we will continue to invest in our system and strive to provide users with a better experience. I apologize again for the inconvenience. If you have any questions about KuCoin, our 24/7 customer support will always be there to help you out. If you are unhappy with their services, you can also DM me at any time, and I am very happy to help you. Thank you.

Here is my response

Johnny,

I am going to post this publicly so here is the TLDR summary

* You are running a business that solely functions on the web, and do a self proclaimed 1 billion in transactions a day.  

   * This is done without industry standard fail safes and protocols/ redundancy
   * You do this without informing the public of your audaciously poor risk management protocols.
* Your website, API’s, and app servers are going down and still processing orders on the backend  

   * Stop losses are not always triggering and the situation is not being made right
* Your website is not failing over
* There is ZERO fail safe or kill switch that cancels orders or suspends trades when the servers go down despite this being common industry practice)
* When the website does not fail over by design
* Cloudflare is being weaponized to deny access to the web server rather than failing over to a redundant gateway/ web server.
* Kucoin is knowing taking funds and keeping them when this happens
* All retail traders are sent to an endless customer service feedback look that gives them literally no resolution

You can elect to fix these issues and go back and actually settle all the funds that were literally stolen by Kucoin. Subsequently you can fix your technical architecture.

Anything less than this and you are playing politics and the community will see ZERO action on this matter.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

The extended answer to your response is as follows:

The one thing I will accuse you of publicly Johnny is being disingenuous. Let's stop the politics and get on with the resolution.

It's sad that it took my subreddit post on [r/Cryptocurrecy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptocurrecy/) getting to the top of the subreddit for you to acknowledge the issue.

It's frankly disturbing I was instantly censored for publicly speaking up on this matter on [r/kucoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/kucoin/). I was not banned for “spam,” I am happy to review everyone of my posts with you to prove this.

I am not the only one that has been censored, there is a pattern of behavior surrounding Kucoins social media management to ban any counter perspective if it has weight.

On to the technical portion:

Everyone uses Cloudflare in almost every industry. It's good that you are using Cloudflare.

In your situation Cloudflare is not innocuous; it has been weaponized. Your Cloudflare settings and policy are such that it does not fail over to redundant infrastructure but treats retail traders as if they are doing a DDOS attack and denying access.

Why is Cloudflare denying access under Kucoins settings and policies? Liquidations are happening while people are still exhibiting and practising proper risk management protocols.

In our instance on September 7th we were intermittently denied access for 5 hours.

Cloudflare either accelerates or decelerates requests to recover or improve application and or web performance.

Cloudflare has the option to failover to redundant website gateways should your peak loads exceed their capability. For enterprise level websites such as Kucoin this is combined with a Ge load balancer that balances user loads to different gateways based of the users source IP and a ton of other policies that get add in in (these are too numerous to document here, I am happy to defer anyone to whitepapers on the matter).

In Kucoins instance they have consciously opted to not fail over website gateways. This means that users are being denied access as the only other viable option when your gateway goes down

To say everyone uses cloudflare as we do is also disingenuous.

For lack of a better metaphor, if you swing a hammer (Cloudflare) and hit some patrons, you can't turn to the crowd and say “hey folks it's just a hammer (Cloudflare)…. Everyone has one.”

To mention your Amazon AWS spend is also disingenuous:

By virtue of the fact you're not opting for a failover gateway and geo load balancing but still processing trades that result in liquidation while retail investors get locked out of their accounts is not ok.

Your IT spend is irrelevant.

You have a fiduciary duty and the trust of the community to tend to their funds and respect their trades. This trust is being violated and repainted as “an IT outage and then blame shifting to the retail trader themselves saying they need to exhibit better risk management.”

You don't get to lock people out of their house for several hours and subsequently burn the house to the ground and blame shift telling them to act more responsibly.

You have ZERO plausible deniability here!

I brought this to your attention personally as I also did with your help desk and our customer Rep Zoe.

Cloudflare and outages are keeping people from accessing their account. Their money is being taken, and Helpdesk sends them to an endless loop with no path of escalation. No one is getting their funds or crypto actually restored after an outage to the point previous to that very outage. Cloudflare is denying access rather than deferring to other gateways to handle the load.

This is by design, there is no plausible deniability as I have personally brought this to your attention as well as the help desk. Since that time there have been no less than 5-10 more outages resulting in more losses by the community.

You have 2 options on how to fix this issue (both of which should be implemented tied together)

* A kill switch (see below)
* Or failing over to a redundant gateway/ webhead and geo load balancing the load.

Again, you would still do both to protect the people

Kucoin has consciously made a choice to do neither after I repeatedly brought this up.

I repeat for emphasis here “You have no plausible deniability.”

**This puts Kucoin on par with Robinhood the app on how they removed AMC, GME, and Dogecoin buy/ sell functionality to benefit the exchanges needs.**

This is an old playbook that predates the Great Depression when banks would lock their doors so customers could not get to their funds for withdrawal to stop a run on the bank.

You are locking your doors via Cloud Flare and server outages stopping us from getting access to our property and breaching fiduciary duty in doing so.

I don't have data proving you have a liquidity issue but your behavior emulates the same issues demonstrated for literally hundreds of years.

Fix this shit immediately!

You can spend all the money on Amazon ( AWS) you want. It doesnt change the fact that your infrastructure prohibits people from accessing their account in times of need. You are locking the doors, stopping people, while putting Kucoin’s interests first

They are liquidated even when they follow proper risk management protocol. They are left powerless, and have no path of engagement to rectify the situation. IF it gets to you, you don't ever actually fix the situation but send every person back down the ladder.

Ask our account Rep Zoe. The person you personally directed us to, and did not deal with our issue either. We have been having this conversation for 2 months!

The situations are not rectified.

I am happy to post all of my emails and telegram messages to back up what I am saying here right now.

Your website could absolutely fail over to a redundant gateway and take on the concurrent load, but it doesn't do that by design (literally). If you can't handle the load then you need to have a kill switch that pauses all trading activity no different than the HKex, CME, and other major exchanges.

Anything less is a breach of fiduciary duty of Kucoin and you as an individual, and frankly spitting in the face of everyone who believed you and trusted you.

These are all measures that I brought to your and your team's attention. No action was taken but repeated outages have happened.

.

I am calling bullshit that you don't know the exchange is going down and that you don't know that people's funds are not getting restored.

I can post my messages with you and all the team right now to back up what I am saying.

The fact stands your website goes down and you knowingly take peoples money. It's never restored and they are sent to an endless loop of customer service until they submit the stolen funds to you.

There is no kill switch and your website does not failover. The OTC desk still processes Institutional orders ( whales) while putting the people of the “peoples exchange” on the menu for harvesting.

The only reason you are responding to me and lifting my ban from Kucoins subreddit is the “people” pulled together and put your company's reputation on the line.

That being said, you have an opportunity to right the situation at this very moment.

I will ask everyone to present their case and we publicly resolve these issues.

If your exchange can't handle the load all leveraged trades should be auto-cancelled without penalty and margin debt clocks are suspended with a path to restoration. Anything less than this and your words are mere words and not actions aka playing politics.

It's a de facto response from any broker/ exchange in a liquidity crisis to remove the buy/sell buttons or turn down the servers removing retail investor access.

Your website is removing retail access while still processing transactions and taking the hard earned funds of the community. No matter what you say this is the reality. It's calculated, it's methodical, and those funds are not being restored for more than 0.5% in a settlement best case scenario. The vast majority of users never have their funds restored.

Retail investors are literally being harvested by Kucoin.

This post is only round one of the screen shots, videos, scans and logs we have.

This is a point brought up several times on Reddit!

You are doing so with no failover or kill switch and exposing people to imminent risk and not informing them of your shody IT practices.

Yet when your website goes down it brings the API server and application server for the app down as well but you still manage to process orders on the back end via the OTC desk. To typically engage with an OTC desk the threshold is often 5 million to 35 million in assets.

So you are liquidating the little guy while providing white glove concierge service to whales.

I am calling you out on the carpet here and now asking you to do what you said you would do and repay those affected.

Subsequently fix your shit!

Lastly I want you to publicly answer one question

“Why did you remove the liquidation price from margin contracts and increase the liquidation risk of all retail traders??

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*If you do not answer this question directly, I will publicly repeat it until you do.\*\*\*\*

You are taking away traders ability to manage risk and then accusing those same people of not managing risk when you liquidate them in an outage.

I am happy to keep sharing with the community what info I have on your environment and business practices “if Kucoin does not exercise proper risk management” and proper fiduciary duties.

This is round 1

Johnny Lyu the ball is in your court and the whole world is watching.

13,CryptoCurrency,RatherCynical,SHIB and other shitcoins.,"This subreddit has a tendency to hate SHIB and DOGE and SAFEMOON a lot.

The problem with shitcoins is that a shitcoin isn't actually investing. It's much, much closer to gambling. If the hype dies down, and the floor gives out, there isn't really a limit on how hard the price can fall. There are not enough buyers on the other side when the whales have made their money and decide to cash out. It's pretty cool for early investors to make a lot of money, but there will be many more ""investors"" who end up holding the bag.

If a shitcoin has a 95% chance of doing nothing - or worse - losing you money, and it has a 5% chance of giving you 1,000% returns, then overall your ""expected returns"" are 1,000% x 5% = 50%. You'd literally be better off buying some BTC and ETH.

There is a place for speculation within a portfolio. If you speculated with 10-25% of a portfolio on DOGE at $0.002, you would've made tremendous returns. Just never go all-in. There are much better projects out there that have a much better risk profile.

Good luck investing, everyone. The next few months are going to be life-changing for many of y'all.",1635120068,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf4hkf/shib_and_other_shitcoins/

16,CryptoCurrency,Sentinel35P,"After a brief convo about cryptos, my 'idiot' friend, invoking DYOR that I talked about, FOMO'ed in SHIBA INU","Last week, I had an ""afterwork"" convo about crypto with two colleagues whom I consider to be close friends.


I'm surprised that friend 1 is somewhat knowledgeable about crypto. He kept on repeating ADA, ALGO and some others as the having potentials. However, he is not invested at the moment. 


Friend 2 is somehow exposed to crypto by way of the Axie Infinity game where he is side-investing to his brother who has some scholars.


Anyway, our convo revolved in me discussing that it is the future, that we are still early, and the likes of thing spurned here in the sub. 


This kind of spiked the interest of friend 2 as he realized that he doesn't know much about crypto, except what he knew already in Axie.


As he had a lot of very specific questions, I told him about the concept of DYOR - Do your own research. I even told them about this sub and the community point system that is the Reddit Moons (which I have high hopes for the future, BTW). And I explained that I won't recommend any coin/token, except maybe to do his research on the top/blue chip like BTC and ETH.
Unknown to me, friend 2 entered the rabbit hole of crypto ""influencers"" on YT and FB. Last night, I received a message from friend 2, asking my opinion or though about Shiba Inu. It dragged me from my dreamy, sleepy state and woke me up. 


I said, just research on the concept of market cap and realize that it may not be up to what some people expects it to be, and that it is essentially a meme coin.
His answer horiffied me. He said, ""I invested in Shiba Inu and I have high hopes that it will surpass the 'dodge' coin. I think its too undervalued and it will reach 10USD.""


I said, you mean the Doge Coin, the one shilled be Elon Musk in the past? He said, yeah, that one. 


I was dumbfounded. I didn't expect a simple conversation last week will lead into this. But for all it's worth, he is in the green as we talked. This prompted me to tell him not invest in it in the long term.  Just know when to take profits and don't be greedy. I further explained the concept of market cap and why it is impossible for it to be at 10 USD (which was his initial target) in the future. The reason it's rallying at the moment is because of hype and also as aftereffects of the bullrun that we may be in rn.

The funny and somehow frustrating thing for me is the fact that he bought first then asked my opinion after. OMG!


The lesson here, I guess, and the piece of advice I learned, is to always be clear on what you say about cryptos when around friends and even families. Especially, explain to them that memecoins exist. Don't let them fall to FOMO. They may blame you later if they will get burned in the future. My friend just FOMO'ed in SHIBA INU after a brief convo with me. I may never get that off my head.",1635119954,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf4g67/after_a_brief_convo_about_cryptos_my_idiot_friend/
23,CryptoCurrency,TiredRightNowALot,A quick explanation / example of why crypto wallet seed phrases are so long,"If you've been around crypto for a while, you know that your cryptocurrency wallet typically has a very long, strong set of words for the password / key.  The other thing you know is that people sometimes forget these words and lose access to their files.  That can be a frustrating thing.  It can also create internet legends, stories and ruin lives.

So why are they so difficult?  Well, that's because (in theory) you could have your entire life savings stored in crypto and then associated with this wallet.  Imagine having that password be easily cracked / guessed / stolen.  That wouldn't be good for anyone, including crypto as a technology.  Here are some examples of how hard passwords can be to crack with today's computers.

&amp;#x200B;

|Character Count|Lowercase Letters Only|Lower and Uppercase|Addition of numbers|Addition of symbols|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|8|5 seconds|22 minutes|1 hour|8 hours|
|9|2 minutes|19 hours|3 days|3 weeks|
|10|58 minutes|1 month|7 months|5 years|
|11|1 day|5 years|41 years|400 years|
|12|3 weeks|300 years|2000 years|34,000 years|

As you can see, the passwords get very difficult.  34,0000 years to guess 1LoveRedd1t! on average.  That's going to be a tough one.

Now, for a wallet seed phrase, let's say there are 12 random words.  There are a total of 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible combinations of words.  This isn't something that even the most adventurous of hackers is going to try - it's not going to happen.

Searching for a reasonable explanation of time to guess this phrase is nearly impossible (to get a good answer).  But suffice to say, it's not going to happen until computers are running in some technology that we don't yet have (quantum computers aren't far off, to be fair).  One explanation I found states that if you were checking 1 Trillion combinations per second and ran the password cracker for 40 years, you'd be no where near 1% of the way through all of the combinations.  In fact, the math displayed shows that you would be this far:   0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%.  

**So why do people get their accounts hacked or stolen?**

Here are a few ways that people still lose their crypto (but not an all encompassing list)

1. Installing programs with a virus / keylogger
2. Accepting and air drop, invite or something from someone online that installs a program, runs a smart contract, or a slew of other exploits
3. Storing their password online in cloud storage (no point in storing your super secure 12 word seed phrase behind an 8 character password....)
4. Websites that are phishing for your data.  Enter your seed phrase here to sync your wallet and receive free shitcoin (this seems to happen more than I would have ever thought)

What to do....

1. Create a strong seed phrase (or write down the one given to you)
2. Write down your seed phrase physically and store it in a LOCKED and SAFE place
3. Store your seed phrase offline if you have to have it on USB or something else
4. NEVER enter your seed phrase online, ANYWHERE
5. Run a virus program, keep it up to do
6. Be skeptical and protect your information.

33,CryptoCurrency,Amelie007,The most widely used crypto scams &amp; attacks and how to avoid them,"Hi, I put a lot of effort into this and I hope it can help you or at least inform you in how to better protect your precious crypto from the most widely used attacks and scams out there.

**1. Phishing Attacks**: This involves clicking on a link that takes you to a fake website that resembles a legitimate site in order to get you to sign-in and steal your login credentials. An example would be getting an e-mail that looks legitimate, pretending to be from an exchange that you use, asking you to immediately secure your account because it has been compromised or something to that effect. In the subject of the e-mail a link is provided which you click but instead of taking you to the legitimate site it takes you to an identical fake website where you input your login credentials. In the process you hand over your details to the attacker, which proceeds to login to the legitimate site and drain your funds.

* *Best way to avoid these*: Bookmark the legitimate sites on your browser and only login to them directly from there, and never from an external link, always verify a site's security (making sure the site’s URL begins with “https” with a closed lock icon and check the security certificate as well).

**2. SIM swap attacks**: Spoofing someone's SMS is actually easier than most people think, and once an attacker can divert your SMS to their phone they can bypass 2FA checks, reset passwords and gain access to your accounts and everything linked to them.

* *Best way to avoid it*: Use an authenticator app as part of the 2FA process and disable SMS authentication.

**3. Clipboard hijack attack:** You get this from having malware on your device. If your device has been compromised with a clipboard snooper then an attacker can replace the crypto address you copied and replace it with its own address when you paste it (There are many forms of malware that monitor clipboard activity to detect if it contains a crypto address, then it automatically tampers with the receiving address)

* *Best way to avoid it*: Don't use pirated software, stick to legitimate operating systems, avoid illegal streams or questionable websites where you can get this type of malware. Use both an anti-virus and anti-malware program, do regular updates/scans and keep your OS updated to the latest security patches. Always double &amp; triple check the address you are sending your funds to.

^(\*1, 2 and 3 can easily be avoided by storing your crypto in cold storage (hardware wallet) where you have to confirm and authenticate every transaction.)

**4. Airdrop scams:** Airdrops are a legitimate way for new crypto projects to promote the launch of a new coin and boosting recognition for their token by distributing it to active members of a blockchain community. Unfortunately, sometimes they are scams, and the tokens cannot be transacted or swapped in any of the popular exchanges, asking you to claim them by going to a questionable site where they ask you to connect your wallet, input your seedphrase or send them gas fees in order to get them.

* *Best way to avoid it*: NEVER give your private keys to anyone or input your seedphrase to claim anything, always double check the legitimacy of the site where you connect your wallet, check [https://airdrops.io/](https://airdrops.io/) to see if the airdrops are legit. Spending money to make money doesn't apply here (Don't send gas fees in order to claim them, you won't get them back). And if something is asked of you, it will only be your wallet's PUBLIC address to see if you qualify.

**5. Greed scams:** A user 'inadvertently' and 'innocently' posts their recovery seed on social media, forums, reddit, etc. You being the 'good Samaritan' decide to recover your newly found wallet only to find out that you need to send ETH to be able to extract the ERC20 tokens, unfortunately for you as soon as you send the ETH there is an automated script that extracts it, leaving you ETH deficient and teaching you a lesson.

* *Best way to avoid it:* Don't be a greedy son of a bitch.

**6. Double your money scams:** A fraudster (maybe someone impersonating a famous person) asks you to send them 1 coin in order to get 2 coins back. Do I really need to explain this one? once you give away a coin, you should expect nothing back.

* *Best way to avoid it:* Ask yourself, would you give away 2 bitcoins in order to receive 1 bitcoin?

**7. Token scams:** Believe it or not, anyone can make a Token in less than 10 minutes and for less than $10 bucks, there are actually many apps out there that facilitate the creation of one. Because of this ease, there are many malicious contracts and rug pulls associated with the newest tokens on the market.

* *Best way to avoid it*: Go to [https://tokensniffer.com/](https://tokensniffer.com/) where you can check for yourself if the latest Token that was shilled to you is a scam.

Hope this has been helpful to you, take care friends.",1635119127,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf47s8/the_most_widely_used_crypto_scams_attacks_and_how/
51,CryptoCurrency,brpintos,Am I the only one who feels that all this NFT craze ain't gonna age well..?,"Am I the only one who feels that all this NFT craze ain't gonna age well..?  
Let me elaborate, and remember, we are not discussing here the fundamentals of NFT's. NFT's will certainly have a place because of what they can offer, and because they're a better mousetrap, but hear me out;  


This all started with crypto art. All of a sudden all these youtubers start to dump video after video on NFTS and how this represents the great new opportunity, hyper gains, 100x, yada yada.   
And well, because misery loves company, crypto punks happened, bored apes happened, and a bunch of other ones. These ""black swans"" helped crystalize the idea that NFT art was an incredible investment.  
And although I'm far from being an expert on everything crypto, I know my ways around design and art, and that's why all this felt funky from the get-go.   
The art business exists since ever. And every one can buy art. Also, digital art business exists since the beginning of the internet. What irritates me, is this narrative that NFT's all of a sudden created all of these. As if before, any of these was possible.  
This has nothing to do with art, art business or ""digital copyrights"" - bored apes and crypto punks went crazy because of the narratives, hype and fomo. There's no intrinsic value to them.  


And because only crypto rich can play this game (buying 100 eths bored apes), now, guys like tony jnyr and others are creating more stupid and cheap NFT collections so us, the ""peasants"" can get in on the FOMO too. All of these will worth absolutely zero in a year, which means, a permanent loss.  


And now, because Jpg's are too ""september"", it's the game industry. Again, the same pattern.   
This is what Backer posted today on twitter:  


*""Given the choice, most humans would dramatically alter their appearance, surroundings, communities.  This is why we will live in a digital world and our digital identities will be worth more to us than our RL.*    
*Nfts are the first phase of “digital” self.""(*

This is just stupid and annoying. NFT's aren't the beginning of nothing in the game industry. Every single problem that nft's could solve, is already solved. Yes it can be faster and cheaper, and more robust, and cool, but that's it. ""Oh because now you can create your own skins and sell them and;"" CS is doing that for a freakin decade. The nerve these guys have, saying out loud things, like they know something that no one else knows; including game companies who hires the most talented people in the industry on multiple areas of expertise.  


And speaking on Metaverse, the Metaverse exists in this  format since Second Life; this was 20 years ago. We already had ""lindens"" to trade for usd, make payments and earn money. Any of this is new, as the matter a fact is old af.  
And guess where's second life now? Nowhere.   
Before talking about NFT's and Metaverse, these guys should be questioning if there's a need and a want for this ""Metaverse"" they're always praying about. But that wouldn't generate many likes and views, wouldn't it?  
They take us for stupid with their cool catchy phrases and riddles on twitter. I can't stand these guys anymore and this NFT's crap.",1635118379,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf3zzo/am_i_the_only_one_who_feels_that_all_this_nft/

From their website:

"" Your digital marketing strategy is incomplete without content marketing, which is why getting it right is always imperative. Our marketing experts are capable of tailoring content so that it engages your target audience at every stage of their journey. ""

"" Growing your followers on social networks will help you increase word of mouth and referrals. We provide social media marketing services that enable you to reach relevant people, increase your following, make connections and drive organic traffic to your website with high success.""

Essentially Coin Bureau is paid to shill the highest bidder. They want you buying their shitty hoodies and t-shirts while they cram misinformation and their agenda down your throat.

While millionaires constitute only a small percentage of the population, they hold substantial control over economic resources, with the most powerful and prominent individuals usually ranking among them. The total amount of money held by millionaires can equal the amount of money held by a far higher number of poor people. The Gini coefficient, and other measures in economics, estimated for each country, are useful for determining how many of the poorest people have the equivalent total wealth of the few richest in the country. Forbes and Fortune magazines maintain lists of people based on their net worth and are generally considered authorities on the subject. Forbes listed 1,645 dollar billionaires in 2014, with an aggregate net worth of $6.4 trillion, an increase from $5.4 trillion the previous year.[12] (see US-dollar billionaires in the world).

Sixteen percent of millionaires inherited their fortunes. Forty-seven percent of millionaires are business owners. Twenty-three percent of the world's millionaires got that way through paid work, consisting mostly of skilled professionals or managers.[13] Millionaires are, on average, 61 years old with $3.05 million in assets.[14]",1635116247,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf3cym/crypto_that_will_20x_in_the_next_5_years/

After 2022 I would like to continue my increased crypto contributions to try to get my retirement to crypto ratio to 1:1. I’m hoping it won’t take too long with the way that crypto is outperforming index funds.

70,CryptoCurrency,Impressive_Oaktree,Should I sell and start trading?,"I used to be a hodl kinda guy, until I picked up a couple of books on trading.

In one of the books it explained that investors (i.e. hodlers) have 1 strategy. It is to hodl and when it goes down, just hope it gets back up. This kinda summed up my last bear market. Traders however are more flexible and can even make money in a down market (in theorie).

So I worked on a trading strategy and I tried to automate it to keep the emotions out. When i backtest the strategy on tradingview it shows some nice results. It even beats the buy and hold results.

I currently use 1/8 of the value of my portfolio for trading, but I have a feeling to double down. If we enter into a bearmarket at some point my flexible 1/8th part probably surpasses my portfolio, so why not increase it.

What would you guys do:

A) start small and test it out a bit more (with the risk of losing gains)

B) Increase the trading amount. You have backtested it so just go for it.

C) ‘sigh’ just HODL!

74,CryptoCurrency,ArtofZed,What is your favourite exchange? I've tried a couple and here is my conclusion.,"Since a lot of people are still new i wanted to write a short roundup about all the exchanges i used.

Binance pre Drama was one of my favorite exchanges. I had a lot of different coins staked and seeing the daily 0,24cents interests was really nice. However due to recent drama / regulation i cant recommend this exchange to anyone anymore. I also have pulled everything out of it. (I couldnt even SEPA transfer my funds out of binance, had to use XLM to kraken)

Kraken a rock solid exchange with beautiful design. It does nothing perfect but everything good. I like it and due to it being secure as hell, i trust them having even more of my funds on them. Currently it is my main exchange and i use it for a bit of daytrading or just simply buy and hold. (obviously moving to my ledger if it becomes bigger)

[Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) \- im not a fan of the exchange itself. I just dig the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) debit cards. Ive used mine for over 4 months and hell yeah free spotify and cashback feels great (gives me roughly 36% return per year) - It is almost impossible to get 1% in germany so with just a 350 Euro stake having 2% is really impressive.

Coinbase - also a rocksolid exchange (use pro for lower fees) It was my first exchange however kraken beats the shit out of it regarding fees. I still use it for the quiz and sometimes to check prices because the watchlist isnt that bad. They also have a crypto card but i think [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) is still superior in this regards.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Others: For my hardware wallet i used the nano x and im really pleased with it. The nano s would be alright too, because so far im only using bitcoin for it, but i wanted to go future proof.

Software Wallets: The algo wallet is one of the best wallets and i love it. I used blits for ONE and dig it too. Others i can recommend are exodus (but APY for staking is low) or atomic wallet.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Ask me anything about all mentioned exchanges, im happy to give more input!

76,CryptoCurrency,VariatCA,"After watching what Doge, Shiba and Safemoon have done, here's how we can get Bitcoin truly adopted by the masses.","Following these few easy steps, we can get even the most crypto-illiterate to jump onto the BTC bandwagon:

1.) Break up whole Bitcoins into Satoshis. It's not enough that BTC is technically purchasable and divisible into millionths, but it should be displayed that way by default. 

Most people don't want to FOMO into a coin that costs $61,000 each, but when that's divided by a million?... Satoshis are only $0.061 each, with a maximum circulating supply of 21 Trillion coins! Even regular Joes can own hundreds, even thousands of these little Satoshi-coins and have their stake in a Trillion+ dollar market cap!

2.) Now that BTC's price and supply more closely mimic doge/shib/safemoon and are easier on the eyes, start revving up the hype train!

Don't let this opportunity pass you by! Imagine if you bought in now at just 6 cents, Satoshis are going to the moon! $1 is next! HODL!

3.) Appeal to the public-at-large. Get some celebrities to start slinging it. Photoshop a new Satoshi icon onto a cute doggy's collar or something. The groundwork has been laid, just get the word out!


After these three easy steps, we can sit back and watch as millions upon millions of people worldwide who never would have touched such an expensive, dauntingly-high-value coin as BTC are excited to scoop up as much as they can, to ride the BTC rocket to the mooooon!",1635111323,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf1smv/after_watching_what_doge_shiba_and_safemoon_have/

93,CryptoCurrency,Independent_Arm_3420,Yield Farming 101 Education - It Did Not End Well,"  

Friday read an article from Business Insider about a Crypto VC fund that was making great returns by investing in Pre-Farming activities (should have been my first red flag – because the ordinary investor like me does not have access). Rugdocs listed the site as “Low Risk” for a rugpull, so I decided that I wanted to try and earn a great APR from the onset of a “Yield Farming” launch. I also knew that I did not want to risk a lot of $$, so, I went in with $350 +/-.

Site was on the AVAX network, so had some USDC that I spent on AVAX and sent to MM wallet and connected to the site. The safest investment that I could see was converting to wrapped DAI which was DAI.e. There was only one site that would convert the AVAX to DAI.e, Trader Joe (should have been my second red flag). And then depositing my DAI.e, the yield was 18,000% APR, but they wanted a 4% deposit fee (should have been my third red flag), but I moved forward with the transaction. As the site went live, and farming began, I noticed that when you “harvested your yield” only 50% was sent to your wallet and 50% remained in your harvest amount until you were able to harvest again in 2 hours (should have been my fourth red flag). As the first 3 hours went by and I tried to capture great yields, the coin that was being harvested dropped from $3,400 to $430 and the yield went down greatly which was Tomato Coin (TMT), which also only had liquidity on the Yield Farming Site (definitely was my fifth red flag). After each harvest, there was a minimal gas fee to put the TMT token into my wallet.

📷

Even though Rugdocs.io listed the site as “Low Risk”, I became way since the APR yield was down from 18,000% APR to under 1,000% APR and the farmed coin continuously dropped hour by hour. I decided to pull my wrapped DAI out and convert it back to AVAX and then encountered not only a gas fee, but, a liquidity fee from Trader Joe (should have been my sixth red flag).

All in all, lost my 4% about $12, and gas/liquidity fees of $3 and AVAX price drop of $15. So, net net, my education cost me about $30. Moral of this story is, DYOR and I’ll coin another acronym for crypto (RTFP – Read The Fine Print), LOL.

However, not all is lost in this experience, included in my education was gaining the knowledge of how to set up an AVAX wallet, convert from AVAX X chain to C chain, send from AVAX wallet to MM wallet, connect to farm site, convert to wrapped coins, and play the yield game.

Lastly, do not be illusioned or have BIG Hopium on some of these projects, study them carefully – even though I lost $30, I’m a lot wiser today. Reckon I’ll miss a Happy Hour or two out with my buddies as a result 😊",1635110862,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf1n85/yield_farming_101_education_it_did_not_end_well/
98,CryptoCurrency,CanChillorNoCanChill,Theory: How a Single Crypto Whale can get rid of $28T of US Government debt," This is merely a theory of sorts. But in news a while back, A Crypto Whale purchased $43,838,916 USD of crypto token SHIB (9/30/2021). Being a bag holder of roughly 6 Trillion SHIB (6,178,758,122,373 tokens) 

Now If this anonymous individual resides in the USA, and were to pay Capital Gains taxes. It is possible for this one individual to pay off US Governments debt. Which currently is above $28 Trillion.

To make things easier, let’s just stick with the Federal Short Term Capital Gains tax of 37%. (Basically anybody whose Income is over $523K\~). And for the purpose of this theory, we will just sell the whole bag. 

That being said the recent ATH $0.00004432 would have turned this person’s $43 Million into $273 million. And if cashed for USD, would pay $129 Million in taxes ($128,940,285).  

If the market price is $0.00016185 it would make this $43 Million investment into $1 Trillion dollars. And be taxed at $397 Million ($397,630,435)

So what does the market price of SHIB need to be for this person to pay 28T in taxes? 

The market price of SHIB would need to be $0.0125. 

The total of this bag would become $77 Trillion (77,234,492,818) and when taxed at 37%, pay 28 Trillion ($28,604,380,860). 

This individual investor could literally wipe out most of the US Governments debt at that point. 

The Power of Crypto will move and change Governments. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** When the price of SHIB hits $0.0125, a Crypto Whale can pay of the US Governments $28 trillion debt with just their taxes alone. Because of math.",1635110725,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf1loc/theory_how_a_single_crypto_whale_can_get_rid_of/

|Top 5|$9,422.81|
|Top 10|$9,365.48|
|Top 20|$10,576.64|
|Best - top 20|$61,059.91​|

However, it is worth noting that one coin in the top 20 actually returns $61,060 (ADA). Some significant returns are also observed with BNB (3,261%) and LINK (1,520%). There is also a coin that is worth $0 today (999). If I dig through for lower cap coins back in 2020, I'm sure I can find some even more jaw dropping returns, however chances are huge that you might pick up a lemon or worse, a 999.

Now let's compare to another popular investment option.

**Stock**

Stocks of most major companies doubled in value in those 20 months. However returns on index such as NASDAQ or S&amp;P 500 are lower (67% and 40% respectively).

The largest outlier is Tesla. The $1,000 invested in Tesla stock back then would be worth $10,572.

|Tesla|$10,571.53|86.05|909.68|1057%​|


**Commodity**

Commodity performed the worst. The largest one, gold, only returns 17%. Silver and oil do slightly better (35% and 37%) respectively.

61,CryptoCurrency,Agreeable_Baby2328,Market Cap Question,"I’m real interested in this concept of market cap limiting the growth potential of coins. Cause it sounds reasonable. So I did some extremely quick, easily could be wrong, research on the historical data of ETH and BTC. 

I chose these for two reasons:
1. We all know where they are at today and we wouldn’t have suspected it in 2015. 
2. I hear a lot of people saying to others things like, “do you really think _____ coin will surpass BTC?!?!”

August 2015 - ETH

$1.26 x 72,000,000 circulating = $90,720,000 MC

$227.18 x 72,000,000 = $16,356,960,000 MC


August 2015 - BTC

227.18 x 14.55M circulating = $3,305,469,000 MC

So by the same 2021 logic, a person could have grabbed $100 worth of ETH at $1.26. At the time BTC was at $227.18. They would have dreamed their ETH hit the same BTC price. 

Would Reddit have swooped in and told them how crazy they were to think it would be greater than BTC? 

If not, then why is this a metric to valuation future value?

If so, please explain, I’m genuinely curious as I start doing more research.

67,CryptoCurrency,gotchacoverd,Don't listen to people that won't disclose their interests. (I've got 15k in crypto),"There is a myth that constantly goes around here that you shouldn't talk about how much you have. It's a bunch of crap. It's like talking about salary at work. It's fine. I make 110k a year. See I didn't get struck by lightning and nobody hacked my wallet. If people aren't willing to talk about how much they are investing, how much risk they are comfortable with, and how crypto fits in their financial goals, then they can't make good decisions.

 Instead we get people talking about portfolio balance in %s without any real show of value. Advice like moving erc-20 tokens to hard wallet from some guy with $100 in crypto. ""DCA and HODL"" from someone that puts in 3 dollars a week. ""Never sell"" for someone that is up 400% on a 10k investment and ""take profit"" on someone up 4000% on a $10 Robinhood buy of doge.

I will happily go first to try and break this stigma. 
I'm 43 years old married with 4 kids. My financial strategy is to max out the pretax retirement accounts for my wife and I so that we can make sure our on schedule retirement is secure. After living expenses We can afford to put 1000 a month or so into crypto as a long term investment hoping to retire in 10-12 years. Everything is intended to be long hold but short term stuff is still attractive. I like to grab coins moving into the top 100-200 and see what they do. I've found some duds and some that made a bit but I've mostly consolidated into the following. All told we have put 9400 into the market.


I have about $6000 in Fantom currently, it's sitting as collateral on geist.finance . I'm very happy with Fantom but kind of disappointed in geist. I wouldn't deposit there again if I had the choice but it's tied up in collateral and too expensive to try and move at this point. I need to pump in enough fiat to but out my loan so I can move it. Happy to discuss my experience with the FTM ecosystem.

I have about $7000 staked in Wonderland Time. It's the most exciting thing I've found in crypto. It's either a life changing investment or the most I would allow myself to ever lose on a scam (5k buy in). Again, happy to discuss. (Full disclosure, the value of Time is closely tied to stakes, so I'm not objective) 

I have about $3000 in stablecoins. Mostly USDT. Why would anyone hold stablecoins? And as 20% of my portfolio too? Two reasons: First, that's the money I have already on ramped that is waiting for a good dip or buying opportunity to present itself. Second, I have it earning about 20-25%. The way that I am earning 20+% on stablecoins is via liquidity pools. Specifically I take USDT and add it to the USDT/USDC/DAI liquidity pool on avax.curve.fi  Liquidity pools create a trading platform for people that need to swap from one token to another. Double stable/ triple stable pools are my personal favorite for holding assets because they don't have a risk of impermanent loss. Your assets are used and people pay a fee to the LP and you get a share of the fee. In this case curve is paying 4% APY directly  and an additional 20% in AVAX to people that fund that pool since it's in demand. Since I believe in the long term value of AVAX I am holding that income. If I didn't have faith in AVAX I would just cash it out. 

Now this is my story, based on my unique situation. I'm not a CFP. It's not financial advice. But I'm not worried about discussion of my experience.",1635108074,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qf0pv0/dont_listen_to_people_that_wont_disclose_their/

9,CryptoCurrency,ArtofZed,Regulatory ECHO - IMF and SEC do not want bitcoin ban,"As Bitcoin continues its October rally, news from the regulatory world is also creating bullish sentiment. Neither the SEC nor the IMF are calling for a crypto ban; instead, both organizations are advocating regulation. Good news is also coming from Germany and the President of Ukraine remains a crypto friend as well. Last week's Regulatory ECHO.

**SEC chief opposes crypto ban....**

After China's crypto ban, the guardians:inside of the US financial system have to take a stand. Because after the head of the U.S. central bank Fed, Jerome Powell, already spoke out against a ban on cryptocurrencies, Gary Gensler followed suit last week. At a hearing before the U.S. Congress on October 5, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) distanced himself from the approach of the government in Beijing. 

According to Gensler, regulatory efforts rather have an integrative task. It is important to ensure that the crypto space is integrated into the financial system, for example in terms of consumer protection and tax law. A ban on Bitcoin is also not within the SEC's remit.

Not only the SEC, but also the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently took a stand on cryptocurrencies. On October 3, the organization published a report discussing crypto-related opportunities and risks for developing countries. On the one hand, the IMF acknowledges there that Bitcoin and blockchain technology open up potential for more inclusive financial services. 

However, according to the report, increasing adoption could also threaten financial stability in developing countries in the future. For example, if citizens prefer Bitcoin to local currencies that are weakened by inflation. In the long term, this would undermine the respective central bank and open up loopholes for tax evasion. To counter such capital outflows, the IMF calls for international standards in crypto regulation.

The online platform Justizauktion of the North Rhine-Westphalian law enforcement agencies will auction bitcoin worth eight figures on Monday, October 25, 2021. It says on Twitter: ""Every euro that is withdrawn from criminal structures helps to weaken them."" 

In addition, the judicial officials will provide information about digital currencies even before the auction. For this purpose, Markus Hartmann, together with public prosecutor Andreas Brück, will give a brief insight into the typical offense fields of cryptocurrencies. In addition, the two explain how the ZAC NRW deals with it. The website was not created specifically to auction bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies already have their own category on it. Other goods that can be purchased through the website include cars, cosmetics, electrical appliances, handbags, games and more.

We have not yet received an answer to BTC-ECHO's queries about how many Bitcoin are involved, how the judiciary will get hold of the seized Bitcoin and what will happen to the funds generated from the auction.

This is just a big fraud, and will end with a 98% correction like we saw in 2018.","A lot of projects are just once again following the same pattern from 2017 when it comes to raising funds. Allocate an initial big % of funds to VCs, key backers at a ridiculously cheap valuation while the project is not even in the public eye, then build some of the features of the project (usually a website, a DEX or couple of pools/farms) and then create a big marketing hyped launch event, where around 10% of the project's tokens can be bought by the public. Meanwhile, 90% of the tokens are controlled by insiders and VCs who entered at 1/100th the price. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Price during deposit perion: $27. Price for VCs: 22c](https://preview.redd.it/uily92gf9gv71.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12a1516e1496dc9524064c4a49ed13484300e700)

This is nothing short of a scam, but this market always drags in the next sucker who thinks they can profit by becoming a ""long term investor"" in these projects, and get in ""early""

The only way this ends is with the early investors slowly but surely dumping their tokens that were acquired at a very cheap valuation on exchanges, while the price corrects 90-98%. 

Many times, terminology like ""vesting schedule"" or locked tokens is used just to confound the retail participants, to make them believe they wont get dumped on. There is a vesting schedule, so the early investors will baghold through a 90% correction right? Lol

There is not one single reason any long term investor must look at these projects. There are several distribution mechanisms in existence today that are much more fair, including stake drops, farm distributions etc where one can acquire tokens of new projects without donating their funds away to the team at a terrible valuation. 

Most of the VCs in the crypto space are pure predators. They give zero fucks if the project even survives or not, as long as they exit their investment with a ton of cheese on top. They can hardly be fussed about the late investors or users. This is the rather sombre reality of an unregulated market - the ones making the rules do it predominantly to enrich themselves.",1635105284,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qezru0/vcs_are_getting_into_projects_at_22c_and_then/

Through these ecosystems, we are able to act as Venture Capitalists. By contributing DOT or KSM to a Parachain Auction, you are voting for this project to become legitimized. By voting you are receiving tokens in exchange for your DOT or KSM contribution. The most exciting part of this is that by contributing you are essentially investing at an early seed round. By contributing in the auction, you are the first public market participants to own the newly created tokens, while still getting back your loaned DOT or KSM after a roughly two year lockup period. This has 2 main appealing features. 

1.) Forces you to HODL DOT and KSM

2.) If you believe DOT and KSM will be higher in price in two years it is essentially ""free money"" 

This draws many parallels to tradition Venture Capital we see in Wall Street and mainly Silicon Valley, but applied to the little guy (us).

Now i positioned myself where 40% is invested in vechain 30% cardano 20% ethereum and 10% on skale. 
Most of it still at loss because of vechain.

Now most of us are in this to gain a better financial and for me that is the case for sure. I am scared that vechain will not grow or i would not make enough profit out of the whole bull market.

Then there is also this feeling (yeah i know it is stupid) that i compare myself yo others already longer in the market. I heard of crypto many times buth did not pay close attention.

I know this might not be the best example about DCA, but since everyone on this subreddit it's always preaching the DCA word and maybe it's not always the tight thing to do. I believe the best way to DCA is to only do it if it will lower your average or in some exceptions after a big dip.

Many people also don’t have a solid investment plan, but rather trade by emotions. That’s when “buy high sell low” happens. 

Ironically a hamster can return 20%, as reported (Mr Goxx, the crypto-trading hamster). “By running in his ""intention wheel"", he selects which cryptocurrency he'd like to trade, as the wheel spins through the different options. His office floor has two tunnels nearby: one for buy, one for sell.”

I don't like this coin personally (ready for the downvotes) as I don't see any solid motive or practical use case rather than just hold and making quick bucks. These coins are literally being driven by the community power. The astronomical imagination of the coin going to the $1 mark. I mean seriously? 

Then shouldn't you buy or stay away from meme coins? I will say no, you obviously can make some small gains and this is not a financial advice but the best thing I love about these memecoins that it brings people to the cryptoworld as most of the times people are afraid/lazy to do research and invest, which is not good for the adoption. Who doesn't love memes and who don't want to ride the hype train? The doge hype literally brought a lot of people previously. 

At the end we really don't know shit about fuck, there are no more wonders that wonder me anymore. But beware from the obvious rug pulls and sometimes ride that hype train, again NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE AT ALL.",1635100681,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qey6ya/yeah_i_hodl_shib/

In this movie, one of the characters intepreted by Rezza is a punk from the early 90s trying to find a way to capitalize on his small salary. In his main scene, he's seen walking in the street talking with himself and counting some money.

The monologue goes something like this:

""10 thousand, 20 thousand, 30 thousand... when I'll reach 2 millions, I'll buy 2 million cans of canned meat and I'll sell them to famiched populations for 6 millions. With those 6 millions I buy 6 millions lighters and then I resell them door-to-door with a gross gain of the 38%. With the net 38% I buy the gross 70% of the stock exchange and I resell it to the gross populations of North-Africa with a maximum rate of 22% and a minimum limit of 2%, with that percentage unbundled from the figure determining its value I buy the Strait of Gibraltar"".

I have a week of vacation ahead of me. What I planning on doing anyway, was trying to get a better umderstanding of finances in general, and markets and some TA in particular. 

The part about finances in general will be covered by books, I have found some online. If someone has  a recommondation for a great book about how the financial world works, I am open for suggestions. 

The TA thing is a difficult one and I am aware, that the markets behave according to a pattern until they don´t. But this is still something that fascinates me and while it might turn out to be that it is actually nothing more than guesswork (I think to determine that,  one has to try it for oneself), I am still positive, that I will learn something from this nonetheless. 

Regarding the TA point, a source for accurate historical data, which could be downloaded and importet into a graphing programm would be awesome.

84,CryptoCurrency,crua9,Something to note for those poor and wanting to get into using bots in the USA,"Long story short, this was the first year I was able to use bots. I wanted to see how well they would do vs natural trading.

What I found is it does make money, but unless if you have a ton to start with then it honestly isn't worth it. With tax tracking software, trading fees, and fees for the bot. It basically isn't worth it unless if you can make a ton of money with about a 5% ROI per month. (basically its a good tool for the rich. Not so much the poor)

Now here is where it gets nasty. If you're poor like me, then you can't afford a $40k CPA. This means you're stuck using some tracking software and that is it. The problem comes in with them being universal with LIFO or FIFO. From my under you can switch from LIFO to FIFO to LIFO sell to sell. But since the tracking software is universal this means you now have to pick one or the other. And sadly you have to stick with it or sell everything at the end of each year.

Selling everything automatically resets the long term timer (which you need to hold something for 12 months or longer to get into that anyways).

(FIFO is first in first out. It basically says what you're selling is reflected of your oldest stuff. So if you bought 100 something in 1990 and 100 now. Then sold 150 something tomorrow it will say 100 of that is from 1990 and the rest now. Which means 100 of that is long term tax bracket and the rest is short term. It basically is the reverse for LIFO last in first out.)

Anyways where the problem comes in is when you buy a given coin to hold. You later set a bot on the coin. With FIFO you could be seen as taking massive losses and gains. Since you can only deduct $3k in loss a year this means you will have to pay massive taxes gains you don't actually have due to how the bot and FIFO mesh. Running it through LIFO fixes this.

So where the big problem comes in is if you stake, mine, etc and you decide to sell. It would be mark under short term gains. This in the USA is automatically a higher tax amount and with the USA if you made less than $40k a year in long-term then there is no federal tax. So this means while you're paying less in taxes now. You also pay more later for normal stuff.

So why quit using the bot at all? Here is where the big kicker is. Tracking software tends to cost more per transaction. Meaning you will have to spend at least w cents per sell on tracking software if you use Koinly, you have to pay the trading fees, you have to pay taxes, and so on. And when you're gaining about 10 cents to 20 cents per trade. You're cutting it extremely close. And the profits between that and just normal trading. Normal trading always pays a lot more.

IMO bot trading isn't worth it unless if you're trading with something like $100k or even $1m to put into the bot. Like even if you don't make any mistake in oh you use a bot on a coin you already bought at a higher value (which still you will run into this problem with the nature of things). You realistically need to make $40k a year just to pay a CPA because if you ever get audited. It will be a nightmare for someone in poverty to get audited over 10k transactions or more.

TLDR bots are a rich person toy.

86,CryptoCurrency,plk8888,Defi LPs - too good to be true?,"I have been trying out some Defi incentivised-for-180-days LPs which have 130-150% APR (not APY, APR ...) and have been consistently getting the daily return expected over the last few weeks. This would indeed mean, all other things being equal, that the return would indeed be 600% APY with the compounding I do daily with the returns. This just seems to good to be true. It overrides most IL scenarios and, since it's more predictable that just buying the same coins and holding them seems to be ideal. It just can't be this good, clearly. Apart from IL, the risks seem to be:

*  It's mostly inflationary tokens like Atom/OSMO and so there is a chance over 180 days that inflation just reduces the coin value so when I liquidate, there are more coins that are worth less.
* The APR drops as more people pile into the incentivised pools and this brings things down to staking APR levels quite quickly.

I kinda regret it because I went all in in all kind of coins with only knowing it’s recent ATH. I had no direction of which ones to buy. Some of these include, I don’t have anymore, Filecoin, ICP, ETC, Doge, and others. 

I kinda don’t regret it because I’m here today and have made some small wins along the way and learned so much about TA. I got me some ETH at a low price which now makes me happy to see it trying to reach its ATH again. 

This brings me to my current crypto state. Since I missed out in so many good coins such as Solana, I saw it at $28 and didn’t buy it because I didn’t know poop, AXS, I saw it dirt cheap but because I don’t play video games I didn’t buy it, and of course the most loved/hated coin, SHIB, that I first bought like 3 months ago but sold days later because of the 0.1 cent thing, as well as many other just because I didn’t know how buy outside Coinbase. 

Now that I can look a coin, look at its EMAs and its MACD, I can have a better idea as to what it could do. As well as its purpose. 

I even wrote a program that queries coin gecko daily and it tells me if I need to sell or hodl. And it sends me an email with a chart of the past 90 days. 

Because of all this, I have became addicted to checking my phone every 1 second to see if Cosmos, Algorand, Harmony, or even freaking Cardano have made me rich. And because I constantly do this, I think is affecting all aspects of my life in a negative way.

19,CryptoCurrency,PasserottoDolcissimo,"Where to find the ""acquired value over time"" of a stock/crypto (if it exists)?","Hello everyone,

I’m new here and I have a question about some market data I wish I could find somewhere.

**-Short question-**

The data I’m looking for is the price at which every individual share of a stock or unit of a crypto was traded last time.

Also an aggregated indicator that calculates the “sum of (each share \* last individual traded price)” would be ok. 

**-Detailed question-**

I would need this indicator to evaluate discrepancies in value of a stock or crypto. Indeed market cap, float and volume can be misleading indicators according to which shares they refers.

Practical example:

Let’s say a crypto (any shitcoin) is generated from nothing and have a total of 100.000 units, now each unit is priced 1$ so the market cap is 100.000$. In detail 50% of them was never traded (0$ tot), 30% was traded long time ago last time at 0.50$ (15.000$ tot) and the rest 20% is actively traded nowadays at 1$ (20.000$ tot). Therefore the real “acquired value over time” (AVOT) it is 0$+15.000$+20.000$=35.000$, and on average all the money put into this asset can support an average price of each unit of 0,35$ (against 1$ of the current price). 

The way AVOT changes is disconnected from any other classic indicator (market cap, volume, float, SMA, EMA, etc) because changes according to which individual units are moved.

Continuing the example let’s say that today 20% of the units are traded at market price (1$). This won’t change the market cap, float or average volume compared to the previous example. In case this 20% are the units bought at 1$ the AVOT won’t change and remain 35.000$. If instead the traded ones are from the pool of the 50% untouched units then it will become +20.000$+55.000$, and on average all the money put into this asset could support an average price of each unit of 0,55$ that is way closer to the actual price and therefore more reliable and solid.

Second scenario: let’s say that 40% of the units are traded during a selloff at market price of 0.5$.

I can see in the future games like GTA with NFT cars and weapons and even clothes. That would revolutionize gaming. Maybe an RPG games with player based economies with different professions and loot that is all NFT. I think the future is bright but we’re no where near the point where is worth getting into.

In the long run, there is a high possibility that these people will get burned, which is why many continue to explore the enormous potential of cryptocurrencies. 

Money is money and when you earn it it doesn’t matter if you earned it on some projects that have a purpose or on meme coins because money does not see the difference.

Compounding interest was called the eighth wonder of the world by [Einstein. ](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/compounding-the-8th-wonder-of-the-world-3203e9793c9d)

So what does it mean? By staking you'll earn more of your favorite crypto by a certain percentage. But for the next cycle of earnings you'll get even more crypto because of the fact that more is staked in total. This will go on and on to further increase your returns slowly. It's a sure way to increase your holdings. Combined with an increase in price it gives you even more potential returns.

It also acts as a partial hedge to price fluctuations.

35,CryptoCurrency,awezumsaws,"Be happy where we are in the market today, because we may be here again","I'm not a financial advisor, and I only got into crypto in early May, but I am by nature a very driven-by-data person, so I've spent the last few months researching technical analysis of Bitcoin and meta analysis of the psychology of markets. What I will explain below is, I think, a fair, data-driven speculation, and I will acknowledge caveats at the end.

According to Elliot wave theory, we are in the 5th wave of a growth trend which historically has ended with Bitcoin having an increasing valuation from the 4th wave bottom at increasingly lower percentages of growth. This is easily seen in the ""[rainbow chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/)"" of Bitcoin's lifecycle. Here are the numbers (in USD, approximated for easier calculations):

* In the 4th wave bottom of 07/2013, Bitcoin fell to 69.70, then in 12/2013 rose to 1237.60 (1,775% of the 4th) before falling in 01/2015 to 166.50 (240% of the 4th) which was a 86.5% fall from the 5th wave peak
* In the 4th wave bottom of 07/2017, Bitcoin fell to 1826.20, then in 12/2017 rose to 19,891 (1,090% of the 4th, 61.5% of the growth of the same time period from the previous cycle) before falling in 12/2018 to 3215.20 (175% of the 4th) which was a 84% fall from the 5th wave peak

Extrapolating those numbers and the Elliot wave theory out to today, where 07/2021 was a 4th wave bottom when Bitcoin fell to 29,313, we should expect approximately 570% growth (60% of the growth of the same time period from the previous cycle) at the 5th wave peak which would have Bitcoin around 195,000 in 12/2021 before falling in 12/2022 to 46,900 which would be a 75% fall from the 5th wave peak.

Given that there is exponentially more institutional investment in this market cycle than in previous cycles, I have strong doubts that the next peak in the Elliot wave will be only 570% of the 4th wave bottom and that the next fall will be 75%, so here are some speculative correction percentages:

* At 500% of the 4th wave bottom and 70% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to 55,500 (190% of the 4th)
* At 500% growth and 60% correction, Bitcoin would fall to 74,000 (250% of the 4th)
* At 570% growth and 70% correction, Bitcoin would fall to 55,500 (190% of the 4th)
* At 570% growth and 60% correction, Bitcoin would fall to 74,000 (250% of the 4th)
* At 600% growth and 80% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to 41,000 (140% of the 4th)
* At 600% growth and 70% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to **61,500** (210% of the 4th) - we were at that number this week
* At 600% growth and 60% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to 82,000 (280% of the 4th)

As you can see from this wide array of calculations, the inevitable major correction cycle will bring us back down to a level that we have already recently seen or are likely yet to see in Q4 2021. I share this because it is helpful for me to mentally prepare now for the psychological blow of seeing numbers like ""195,000"" slowly turn into numbers like ""60,000"". I was certainly psychologically unprepared to see 64,000 turn into 29,313 or see my ""buying the dip"" of ETH at 3,990 turn into 1,721 which old-timers in this market will surely tell you was nothing they hadn't lived through before. May we all keep our heads about us through the remainder of this cycle and beyond.

Caveats:

* One major caveat to this speculation is the possibility that COVID-19 in 2020 introduced a false downward trend into the Elliot wave which would mean we are not actually in the 5th wave of the pattern but the 3rd. In this case, my extrapolations are meaningless as it is impossible to forecast what impact an economic crisis from a global pandemic has done to the market cycle.
* Due to the lengthening cycles of this market (see the rainbow chart) and market capitalization, it is also unlikely to see the rapid growth in a mere 2.5 months as I indicated. However, the Elliot cycle runs independently of the calendar, so the 5th wave could easily run well into 2022, and the correction/fall run well into 2023, but the numbers themselves would still play out. I happen to believe this is actually what will happen, again given the institutional investment and market capitalization in this cycle.
* And of course I, like everyone, don't know shit about fuck, so take all this with a few grains of salt

Final speculation: I also believe that when we see the correction at the end of this cycle, it will occur largely in parallel to a major correction in the US stock market. There will be a period of time (late 2022 to early 2023) when the decreasing value of the US dollar due to inflation will be less than the decreasing value of both stocks and cryptocurrencies, so there will be a pullout from both markets. When the dust settles, the crypto market will be globally recognized as the safer investment, and by 2025-26 we will see stability enter the crypto market that has not yet been seen, eventually leading to a flattening of the rainbow chart and the end of the US dollar as the global standard in the early 2030's. Then, the ""crypto market"" will cease being just that, and the different market sectors - tech, pharma, real estate, insurance, etc - will become sectors within the crypto market itself as those industries migrate operations to blockchain and adopt cryptocurrency payment systems. All this final shifting will rise out of the next correction cycle of the current Elliot wave which is years away, perhaps more than a decade away. If you entered this market when I did and got smacked in the face almost immediately but hung in there, it's ok.

37,CryptoCurrency,Fluid_Department_120,5 Dollar-Pegged Tokens Command 94% of the Swelling $135 Billion Stablecoin Market Cap,"#During the last month, four out of five of the top stablecoins by market capitalization saw their valuations swell in size. At the time of writing, there’s $135.4 billion in stablecoins but the top five collectively represent 94.40% of that total. While the largest stablecoin in terms of market cap increased by 2% over the last 30 days, the stablecoin DAI issued by the Makerdao protocol expanded by 22%.



Tether and Circle’s USD Coin Rule the Roost
Stablecoins are very popular these days and it’s safe to say that these dollar-pegged tokens are not going anywhere any time soon. For instance, at the time of writing, there’s around $29.2 billion in global trade volume dedicated to bitcoin (BTC) trades only.

Currently, the stablecoin tether (USDT) commands 61.46% of all the BTC trades according to cryptocompare.com data. Below the U.S. dollar is the stablecoin BUSD, a stablecoin curated on the Binance Smart Chain as BUSD commands 5.29% of all BTC trades today.

BUSD is, in fact, the only stablecoin in the top five that did not see its market cap inflate. The largest stablecoin market cap today is tether (USDT) which commands a valuation of $71 billion at the time of writing, according to market aggregation sites like Coingecko’s “Top Stablecoins by Market Cap.”

Tether’s transparency web page that shows Tether’s current balances says there’s approximately $70,578,488,377 worth of USDT. With close to a $71 billion increase, USDT has grown by 2% during the trailing 30 days.

The second-largest stablecoin issued by Circle and the Centre Consortium, usd coin (USDC), has swelled by 8.9% this month. Presently, USDC has a market valuation of around $32.8 billion which is around 46.19% or close to half the size of USDT’s market cap.

Tether’s global trade volume is much higher than USDC’s at $52,791,455,644 while USDC’s is around $1,936,810,797. USDC is paired with USDT and BUSD and according to cryptocompare.com data, they are the top two trading pairs with USDC.

#The 3rd, 4th, 5th Stablecoin Contenders
While the stablecoin that stems from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem, busd (BUSD) is the third-largest cap, it has not increased during the last month. BUSD holds a valuation of about $12.9 billion at the time of writing and $3.4 billion in global trade volume. BUSD is swapped on 98 different exchanges according to today’s data and it’s ranked 18th out of 9,957 crypto assets.

The algorithmic decentralized finance (defi) stablecoin issued by the Makerdao project, dai (DAI), has seen the most growth this past month gaining 22.7%. While the third-largest stablecoin BUSD has a market cap of around $12.9 billion, DAI’s market cap is $7.4 billion today.",1635096219,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qewo4p/5_dollarpegged_tokens_command_94_of_the_swelling/

Taking profits does NOT mean selling everything and walking away.  At least, in most situations.  Taking profits means selling a *portion* of your portfolio when the market is irrationally high -- for example when the Fear &amp; Greed Index is spiking.

If you choose to then make a quality-of-life choice to spend those profits on a vacation then so be it.  But often people leave out the most common scenario which is to *use those profits to buy back in when prices are irrationally low again.*  

There's nothing clever about HODLing Bitcoin back in April at $64k and watching with a dumb look on your face as it retraces back to $30k in July and you have nothing to show for it.

Smart money saw the writing on the wall at $64k, sold a *portion* of their portfolio while prices were high, then accumulated again in the $30k range.  Now their portfolio is back at $60k Bitcoin but *they have more of it*.

 \- Discovering that BTC/ETH is a safer bet. Putting some into it

 \- Finding alt coins and the need to diversify the portfolio and taking some risk (more than BTC/ETH but less than shitcoins) in order to achieve substantial gains

 \- Start to DCAing

It is a process from all of us will benefit in the long run.

**Tell me have you seen the glorious Hamster?**

Having witnessed this sub's commentary on the legendary crypto-trading hamster that generated significant gains, I sought out to get my own hamster. As I don't have enough time to invest in a pet, and because I wanted to practice my currently-shit coding skills, I opted to create my greatest invention yet: Hamster++, the robo-hamster that gives you financial advice (this is not financial advice) on what crypto to buy based on the highest quality random number generators.

&amp;#x200B;

**Random Number Generation**

In modern computer software, randomness is not truly random. To account for this inherently nonrandomness  within our random number generators, we call them pseudo (like, but not exactly) random number generators, or [PRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator)s. The big thing with these good-enough random number generators is that if you know the starting value for the algorithm (the seed), you can effectively predict the generated sequence -- this is unacceptably nonrandom for my purposes.

Luckily, smart people with good reasons to be interested in PRNGs came up with a solution for this. They needed good random number generators to develop algorithms for important things like encryption, so they created advanced PRNGs that they properly named *cryptographically secure PRNGs, or CSPRNGs*.

The Python programing language enables you to make use of these advanced algorithms in its ""secrets"" module, intended for important things like password generation n shit. My dumbass used to to enable the most random selection of a crypto from a list (currently contains Coinbase Pro's listings).

&amp;#x200B;

**The Code**

If you're interested in the robo-hamster, you can get the code and resources off my github page here: [https://github.com/Adri6336/hampp](https://github.com/Adri6336/hampp) . Since this is my actual github, Imma use this here throwaway account. All scam messages sent to me will be ignored, mostly because I'm broke af and don't actually have any crypto to get stolen.

In order to run Hamster++, you'll need to have the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed. Also, I made this on Linux, so the gui may look a lil wonky for Windows users -- I haven't had the opportunity to test it on Windows 10 yet",1635095181,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qewbuo/since_we_cant_all_afford_a_high_quality_hamster_i/
56,CryptoCurrency,Upsilon_psi,Unpopular Opinion: Not every adoption is good Adoption,"Let's be honest for a second, the current crypto market is a shit show. It is basically a big ass Casino coupled with social media popularity contest. Having more people buy crypto and NFTs is not necessarily crypto/blockchain adoption. 

The way I see it, adoption means using the technology in our day to day life to provide a service and add value. It is not about buying low and selling high (or the most used strategy: buying high and selling low).

What's happening right now is playing a monopoly game on a Global scale. Think about it this way:

* If tomorrow, crypto just suddenly disappears, will that affect you life or the economy is any way? (other than the suicide hotline going crazy)
* How many are actually using crypto for paying for goods and services in such a way that FIAT money can't provide?
* How many are actually using NFTs for real life uses such identification, supply chain or protecting real work assets?

In other words, it is just transferring money from normal people to whales (and few early adopters). 

Some people might argue that this helps people learn, but unfortunately the contrary is happening. Most don't want to learn, they just want to buy a shitcoin with gazillion zeroes and ride it to the moon. That's why you can see a copy paste code with no use case what's ever having more 10x of proper innovative project with a development team and actual vision.

From what it seems, the majority are joining the hype and teaching other ignorant people wrong information, and for that it is a norm now that (these are just to list a few):

* Reflections = staking
* Decentralization doesn't mean shit
* Market cap doesn't mean squat
* a copy paste code/wallet/program is innovative if you say it loud enough 
* all coins are the same
* The worst of all, a scam project with so many red flags is being nominated for at least 4 award categories in a blockchain conference (I am not gonna name, if you know, you know) just because it has a cult. Which means, even the people who organize a blockchain summit can't even analyze transactions on a blockchain.

I believe in what crypto can bring, I hold it and will continue holding and I am actually in it for the tech (and the gain obviously). But I would prefer a sustainable slower gain that will continue, than a pump and dump scheme (which will be the case if the majority are into it just to make profit and scam the next guy).

61,CryptoCurrency,24KSPECTRUM,NFT MARKETING GUIDE USING WHY - WHAT - HOW (and some things to avoid),"**Hello everyone. I wanted to share with you some tips I have picked up on my NFT journey!**

**When starting an NFT project it is super important to develop a strategy and a future vision. If there is a weak strategy or future vision, you can forget the rest. Your community loves when you have a plan and a story to tell. To develop a proper vision, you can ask yourself these three questions.**

1. **WHY -** WHY are you doing what you're doing? Are you doing it for the art? are you doing it for the community? Both? What's your story? Why did you get into this in the first place? These questions are fundamental when developing a marketing strategy and it gives people something to hold on to when first joining your community. People love stories, and if you can tell them a good story from the beginning, they are much more likely to hold on to your project! Tell them a bit about yourself, how old you are, your background, and why you're doing this in the first place.
2. **WHAT** \- This is where you demonstrate WHAT you're doing, how you are creating value for your community. Here, you will explain your vision and future plans and where you are going with the project. Here you could also explain how your art process works and what makes it valuable for the investors. In this part, you will give people a reason to stay in your community and make them curious about your project and believe in your future value and what you are doing.
3. **HOW** \- How are you going to do all this? Here is where the marketing kicks in. Every great project needs a great community, and it doesn't have to be thousands of people. You only need a handful of hardcore fans who believe in your work and want to be involved. Hold on to these fans. Give them something that not everyone gets fx. Airdrops and exclusive giveaways, be creative! Create an exclusive whitelist where they get exclusive drops in the future and early access to all your mints. Interact with them and make them a part of your project and even ask them for help and where they want to see your project in the future. If you build a good foundation, your marketing will be so much easier since your fans will spread the word. Although you have built up a good community, you still need to do some external marketing yourself. Below are some ways you can use marketing to gain new investors and followers.

**MARKETING**

1. Do it yourself or hire someone from your community or online to interact in different NFT communities and tell people more about your project. There are a bunch of varying Telegram and Discor(d) communities where people are looking for new projects to get into. This is where you combine the WHY - WHAT - HOW model into a short pitch, and if it's good enough, it will most likely convert into new active followers. Launching a project can be overwhelming, so don't try to take over the world on your first day. Ask for help.
2. Be active on Twitter, post sneak peeks, interact with your Twitter audiences as well as your Discor(d) community. Talk with them, ask them how they are doing, be honest, and never lie about anything or give false hopes. This is a crucial step to build up trust and be relevant. One false promise can take your project down, so be careful! 
3. Collabs, this is probably one of the best ways to market your selves in our opinion. Find projects similar to yours and ask for a collab. This is super effective BECAUSE if they already love the other project, they'll likely love yours. In our experience, this has gained us the most amount active followers. 
4. ADs this can be effective, but also, you could potentially spend LOADS of money with almost no conversion. Beware of this option since finding the right group to target can be a struggle.

This is a long-term game! Most projects don't gain hype overnight, so keep going and don't lose hope. If you believe in your art and have some people in your community who do as well, you probably have something special in your hands. Remember, projects don't need to sell out on the first day to be successful, and there will be some people on the way that will try to drag you down.

**Mistakes that we made and you should look out for!**

Be careful and judgmental when hiring an NFT promoter, both on Twitter and Discor(d). Especially beware of those who advertise them selfs as an NFT promoter. It may look like a good deal at first, with loads of retweets and likes, BUT most of these promoters charge a HIGH fee, and often you'll receive very few new followers, maybe 2 of them are active, and perhaps one of them slips into Discor(d). Ask them questions and be super judgmental. Otherwise, your budget will quickly burn up. If a promoter contacts you on Twitter claiming to be someone. Always ask them to contact you on Twitter through the account they're claiming to be representing.

75,CryptoCurrency,ejMileman,Is Grayscale GDLC the best arbitrage play of our lifetime? 20% discount to net assets? or is something odd happening?,"Grayscale funds are only way I have found to buy crypto in my IRAs at traditional brokers like Fidelity, etrade, etc.  I hold some GLDC - see below.  Its a $642million asset fund (but not an etf or mutual fund).  Its more like MSTR without the software company.  Just a bank account and crypto assets.  ARKK held some of its bitcoin fund for a while.  

You can buy and sell GLDC all you want as long as you select ""speculative"" or ""aggressive"" on the investment style at Fidelity or Ameritrade.  Tada. You own crypto in an IRA without doing anything hard or complicated.  Just buy GLDC.

Checking Grayscale website, GLDC is 64% BTC, 26% eth, 4% ADA 3% SOL and the other 3% in other various cryptos that may become something in the future.  It rebalances quarterly.  Nothing strange there.  I like the mix.  BTC is the store of wealth.  ETH is the transactional tool.  And others are incase they overtake.  

Anyway, at times, when ETFs or Mutual funds lack liquidity, they trade slightly above or slightly below net asset value.  Ive never seen a fund trade at more than 1% away from net assets.  I saw this on the website for GLDC for 10/22/2021.  Market price $32.44. NAV of Holdings $40.52.  Isnt that buying dollar bills for 81 cents?  What am I missing on this?  Some valuation info that doesnt' tie out? some FASB rule that requires them to state assets ABOVE NAV?   

Here are caveats on website

90,CryptoCurrency,Der_genealogist,Compound interest or how to earn money," 

A lot of you might noticed that you can earn an interest if you stake or lend your money.

You might ask how long would it take to double the amount of your coins since that's something we all want, am I right?

Let me introduce the Rule of 72 to you then. According to that rule, to get an approximate time it'll take to double your investment is to divide 72 by the annual interest rate.

Now some examples to see it more clearly:

If your interest rate is 5 percents, it will take 15 years to double your coins.

With 8 percents, it would take app. 9 years.

Do you want to be faster and double your coins in 5 years? The rate should be then 14.4 percents.

Should you use compound interest on your coins? Definitely! Should you expect to double your $100, $1000 or $10000 in few months just from compound? Definitely not.",1635093975,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qevxmc/compound_interest_or_how_to_earn_money/

You can buy crypto from exchanges, or through P2P websites.

There are pros and cons to all exchanges, but you can’t go wrong with any of these.

1. Does it have any of the words: moon, mars, or bull in it? If so, it's most likely a scam.

2. Do they promise you 2x and up returns? If so, it's most likely a scam.

3. Did you learn about it on Reddit? Is there no other public information available about it on sites such as CoinGecko or CoinDesk? If so, it's most likely a scam.

4. Does their website not have links to a GitHub or other public repository for you to review their code? If so, it's most likely a scam.

5. Is their website informationally sparse and lack actual substance? If so, it's most likely a scam. 

6. Do they require you to lock your coins/tokens without being able to sell them? If so, it's most likely a scam. One caveat to this is that there are reputable and long term projects that do require staking. If a new project requires you to lock your assets, then chances are the creator will end up selling after you pumped up the price.

7. Is there not a clear fundamental use, service, or some sort of problem that they are trying to solve other than to ""moon shot""? If so, it's most likely a scam.

The more items that the questionable coin/token hits on the list above, the greater the chance its a scam. Keep in mind that there are some legitimate projects that might hit one of these items, so use this as a guide and a moment to take a breath and think before you spend.

A lot of you probably know that CMC emails got leaked, but no passwords etc. Even if that is true, your email is enough to cause trouble!

Email phishing:
You will 99% receive spam emails that will try to phish your information for exchanges or banking. Don't fall for this. Do not open any email that you didn't use to get before the leak. Do not open any link that might say something about your wallet or your exchange. Always double and triple check the email addresses that send you the email and even then make sure the content of the email is safe.

Social Media:
If you used the same email for social media accounts, they might try to get into them. You should change your passwords and if it bothers you even more, make a new email for your social media.

Exchanges:
If your email got leaked and it is associated with any exchange, change your passwords and even change the email too. Enable 2FA, preferably with an Authenticator.

TLDR: If you don't feel safe with the leaked email anymore, make a new one and replace your old one from any platform you want. I suggest changing it everywhere.",1635093069,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qevmkz/cmc_email_leak_how_to_protect_yourself/

Most blockchains at one time or another have experienced congestion that has slowed the network or taken it down. 

Harmony ONE is currently experiencing network congestion which is making many transactions that previously took 2 seconds, take 10-30 seconds. This might not sound like a lot, but when you are conditioned to fast transactions, this makes it seems like it takes forever.

45,CryptoCurrency,JustAd2122,Shitcoin smart contract crash course,"Hi guys,

Couple of days ago I have been offered to buy into a shitcoin (which I won't name since it is not the point) and I have been wondering since how does it really work (creation and swap), how is the price being decided, how can one manipulate the price and why it is commonly said that you will not be able to sell the coin to get your money out.

Since I don't plan on making such a scam I don't want/need to go too deep in the subject and get all the technicity so if someone can explain/participate/give his/hers opinion I'm very thankful !

1. How does it really work?
To buy into said shitcoin you simply have to copy the contract address displayed on CMC or Coingecko and add it to a swapping plateforme. However, if you search for the coin in itself on a swapping plateforme you can't find any pool for it. So how can you swap it? Are the tokens locked into the smart contract and when you send some Eth to this address you get said amount of SHTC (for shitcoin)? Or is the smart contract actually a pool in which the creator of the coin has added both ETH and SHTC after creating the shitcoin ? If it is the first answer, then how the price evolves ? For price manipulation, I guess the creator just have to buy more of the coin when he wants it to go up. But in that case, isn't it possible to follow the transactions on the explorer and see if they all come from the same wallet/a wallet that has interacted with the same addresses over time, linking it to the owner ...?

2. How will you lose money?
If the coin gains in value because your friend has been very good at pitching it, you want to sell out and get your Eth out of it, some say there can be scenarios that there wouldn't be enough liquidity for that. But if the pool (/smart contract?) has been used for buying it, the price should be the direct image of the imbalance of tokens in the pool, hence you should be able to get tokens out on the other side by selling. Okay, your selling power will probably balance the price back to a neutral (or below original price) at some point but since you are not the only one who swapped, you should be on the safe side if, let's say, the coin went 10x, 100x or 1000x. No ?

I'm asking this second question because the price went 5-10x quite fast and I was wondering if investing a small amount of money just to double it wouldn't be a very easy and safe way of making money if you stay realistic. Like putting 1k and getting 2k out in two days, that's a pretty good job 🤷🏽‍♂️

So yeah, pretty long post for not so much, let's hope it interest also other people and someone care to share some knowledge here!

Thank you very much.",1635092073,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qevapc/shitcoin_smart_contract_crash_course/

I'm a mobile cryptocurrency enthusiast and I do all my transactions and wallet operations on my iPhone.

This morning, I wanted to check the exchange rate between CKB and CAD, so I just used coindex converter. I had used the site in my browser several times before, but this time I clicked their little ad at the top to download their app. So I clicked, and then it brought me to a very convincing looking App Store page to download it. It may have been the real App Store but I'm really not sure. I swiped through the highlights of the app but I *did not download it* and instead closed whatever I was in.

After I closed, I saw that there were several apps that had downloaded by themselves. These weren't any nefarious apps, but just apps that I had once used and then deleted - such as games or things like that.

Anyway, since my wallets and exchanges are on my phone, I'm scared to open them now for fear of letting in a hacker to see my assets etc. As far as I know, all my funds are still where they should be.

52,CryptoCurrency,Mr-Night-Owl,SHIB Will Drop Another 0.,"Shiba Inu soared to record highs over the weekend to become the 11th-biggest cryptocurrency by market value.

It’s astonishing to look back a couple of months and see how much SHIB truly gained. Whether you sell to rebuy on dips or not, most SHIB holders are seeing profit today. Downvote all you want, but SHIB will drop another 0 in the near future.

Some crypto analysts believe Robinhood will list SHIB in the coming months, as the online broker is set to unveil a crypto wallet. As of Saturday over 290,000 people have signed a change.org petition asking Robinhood to list Shiba Inu. Supporters of SHIB are hoping to push the price as high as $0.01 in the long term. (Bibhu Pattnaik, Benzinga Staff Writer, 2021)

“Memes have value and have been an investible thesis in 2021,” Jonathan Cheesman, head of over-the-counter and institutional sales at crypto-derivatives exchange FTX, said in an email Sunday. “Lower dollar-price tokens are attractive to retail” because investors can still buy more than 20,000 SHIB for $1, he said.

57,CryptoCurrency,NightCloud-,Is Ethereum the one?,"Hi,
I'm looking for advice. I've been in crypto for a couple of months. I started in March of this year thanks to a friend. Following his advice I bought some coins from top 20 by market cap, mainly Ada and Vechain. In May I was very scared to buy some more because of the crash, but thanks to you guys I did and I've been rewarded. I bought Eth at ~2k (my best investment so far, really proud of that one) and I also DCA'ed my other coins. As time passed and I saw my portfolio grow, I started to watch a lot of crypto related content on Youtube. I love 2 channels in particular: IntoTheCrytoverse and Coinbureau, and I watch them daily.

Now that we are in a bull run and everyone is excited about the new ATH's of BTC and their favorite altcoins, I want to invest big. I am looking for a coin or maybe a couple, that will do well in the next couple of months (end of the year or even further into Q1 or Q2 of next year). My choise stopped with ethereum as it was my best investment so far and because I really do believe in the project and I don't see any other projects beating the smart contracts king anytime soon. I am now asking for your advice as you guys didn't disappoint me so far.


P.S: I understand the risks of my decision and if the market were to drop tomorrow and we would enter a bear phase I do believe that we would eventually grow back and make new ATH's, even if it takes a couple of years. I am confident that I wouldn't sell any of my coins at a loss because I don't need that money anytime soon and  I have a stable, well payed job.

I did it purely to experiment with how to use the app and didn't put much money in at all, but I still managed to turn $15 into like $4.

Last month I decided to convert it back to BNB, so I approved the transaction and then on the confirmation screen it indicated that after network fees I should have walked away with abkut $2.50 in BNB... but the final transaction amount under my history in Trust Wallet is $0. Not sure if it was a scam, if i did something wrong, or if there wasn't enough liquidity, but the $2.50 just vanished. I even pulled it up on BSCScan and it showed the $2.50 supposed value but then at the bottom said $0 as total value after the transaction processed. 

Even stranger is I noticed today while importing my data to Koinly that I still have some WIFEDOGE left in my trust wallet balance (even though I had told pancake swap to ""sell"" / swap the max amount possible when I did the transaction last month). 

So I was going to try to do another conversion to BNB to totally clear out the remaining balance of this shitcoin and get it off my portfolio, but it's showing $0.56 in network fees and a total earning of $0. I am so confused. Here are screen shots:

http://imgur.com/a/ohdFSDM

If my total value is $0, then where is the network fee being taken from? If I don't have any value for the transaction, where is it going to pull the $0.56 from? Because to me it looks like there is nothing to deduct it from? 

And my other question...Is there *any* way to get rid of the remaining WIFEDOGE or is this some kind of liquidity issue / do I just have to let it sit there in my account?

Very grateful and appreciative for any answers to the above questions, I feel like I'm missing something obvious here but none of it is making sense to me.

2.  I am currently inclined towards Ledger Nano X. Are there any downsides or other factors I should consider

&amp;#x200B;

May 2021:

1. i bought BTC and ETH and keep it in binance. I'm a crypto newbie. That's all.

&amp;#x200B;

As of today, October 2021:

1. owned 2 hardware wallets and keep most of my coins there.
2. trading coins in CEX like binance (primary) and kucoin (back up)
3. have accounts in CeFi lending platforms like Celsius, Nexo, etc.- i lend only a small portion of my coins there, the majority is in cold storage wallet.
4. learn how to use metamask wallet coz i need it for play to earn crypto NFT gaming.
5. learn how to use DEX like pancakeswap, etc. and other bridges.

That's all. I wish to learn more in the future.",1635090003,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeumip/update_my_crypto_journey_last_may_2021_and_now/
19,CryptoCurrency,northwesternsamurai,Terras UST subpoena and lawsuit ordeal with the SEC is infuriating.,"“The lawsuit filed Friday notes that the SEC contacted Kwon over Mirror Protocol back in May 2021, before Kwon was interviewed for five hours the following month. The filings note that the SEC attorneys then advised Terraform Labs that “enforcement action was warranted” on Sep. 15, 2021. Kwon was served with the subpoenas at Mainnet five days later. 

Kwon’s lawsuit contests the SEC’s request for him to provide testimony to U.S. regulators, arguing that he is a resident of South Korea. It also takes issue with the way the subpoenas were served: SEC rules state that investigations should be confidential, but the agency hired a group called the Cavalier Courier &amp; Process Service to serve him the subpoenas at the event. A note in the lawsuit reads: 

“Hiring a “Cavalier” process to approach Mr. Kwon in public, and announce the purpose of his approach, at a summit attended by more than 2,000 people was, at worst, an intentionally brazen display meant to publicly intimidate and embarrass, and at best reckless, creating social media and press speculation about the incident within minutes of the attempted service of process.”

The SEC serving a subpoena publicly in front of thousands of people clearly going against its own policies is so blatantly an act to intentionally bully, intimidate, and harass defi. 

One thing I know is that Koreans don’t stand for this kind of behavior and public humiliation. I hope they messed with the wrong people this time. Good on Terra for suing them. The outcome of this lawsuit could have major implications for the future of defi.

33,CryptoCurrency,FutureIsCrypto,Advice for ill-feelings towards SHIBA-INU...,"As I was reading the front page this morning, there was a particular comment that really hit me. I don't remember who it was but they said something along the lines of ""***how we feel about SHIBA-INU's growth and how it is fundamentally, is the same way how non-crypto people view us***."" This hit me like a train in that it rings very true. Think of how many people you have talked to about cryptocurrency (if any) and have questioned its use-case, legitimacy, value, etc. Of course, some will agree and that's awesome. However the ones that don't agree will later go on to spread ill-will towards crypto because they have missed out and most likely are somewhat jealous. I will admit, I still struggle with this from time to time. 

For us, we viewed Doge and SHIB as meme coins who were supposed to be nothing more than a pump and dump or, just speculative fun. I think for most of us, we feel somewhat jealous that the hours we spent researching our coins were in vain as we see coins such as these rise significantly in value while our coins are down. In the back of our minds I think we all wanted to take a small chance on them but were too hesitant to invest based on what the majority of people were saying here. Instead of the ill-feelings towards the people who have made some nice gains, we should congratulate them on their success and having some **diamond balls** lol. 

Look back at when you first entered the cryptoverse. You took a speculative chance, gamble, risk, or however you want to word it against what the majority of people were telling you. Chances are, you have done pretty damn well up to this point. It's no different than what people who have invested in Doge or SHIB have done. They went ***against the majority*** and came out on the other end a whole lot richer. In the end, our profits from any coin are most likely going to flow back into the market as we chase more gains. Unless you want to buy that Lambo, then as r/Wallstreetbets would say... fuck you and good job.

If we want to hit that 10 trillion dollar market cap for crypto as a whole, we need to be unified and hype each other up when gains are made or help each other out when we bleed from the rear. Remember speculate, but also have some common sense from time to time like investing in 69cumrocketapeshitlongtothemooncoin. 

May the gains be with us all these next few months.",1635089460,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeug48/advice_for_illfeelings_towards_shibainu/

44,CryptoCurrency,jgarcya,Crypto currency... The great shift,"In our current lifetime.... We are seeing one of the greatest wealth transfers in all of history...

Yes coins like bitcoin and ethereum are rewarding the early adopters....

But then we have meme coins like doge and shiba elevating the poor to new heights...

Why is this....

Because poor people, like myself, feel as if the crypto train has left us behind... Unless you were lucky enough to get in before April 2020.

So the poor look for that gamble... They can't buy 1 btc, but $400 buys you 10,000,000 shiba inu.

Then we start thinking.... Well all I need to be rich is 

10,000,000 x .01 is $100,000

100,000,000 shibe. X .001 is $100,000

But 100,000,000 x .01 is $1,000,000.....

This is how we are thinking.... Desperate to get out of poverty.. A prayer, and a dream.

I'm not endorsing shitcoins... But I am watching and a part of what is happening...

Then we start to see huge amounts of money being moved into these coins.... I'm talking $100's of millions of dollars...

The price spikes overnight..... 

Yesterday 10,000,000 shiba cost $280, today $410...

A few months ago you could get 100,000,000 shibes for this price....

The moderate conservative crypto invester at first... Laughs, then they mock, but after seeing 300-1000's% gain, they join in...

Market cap shoots up billions over night... 2 meme coins are in the top 15...

More money from the middle class and upper class join in...

Now memes are flying...

Poor people that put in a few hundred bucks are now worth $10,000- $100,000's... A few millionaires are made.

As the frenzy continues.... More zeros are dropped of the price... Now it takes more money to make less returns... But people are greedy.

Now a meme that way 10,000th of a penny are now 1000th of a penny.... More millionaires are created from a few $1000 investment.

It's happening before our eyes... We seen it with doge, from ..004 to .74 in less than a year.... Now shibe removed 2 zeros in a year.

Like it or not, but the great wealth transfer has begun... The rich and middle class are handing money over to the poor fist over fist...

The very rich are making 100-300% returns in bitcoin... While the poor are making 1000's-10,000's% on memes..

I'm not endorsing memes.... It's very risky... But I'm holding both doge n shiba... And am experiencing the shift directly...

I know there will come a time where they may disappear, maybe by the end of the 4yr cycle....

But in the meantime people are getting rich! Thank you FOMO'S.... And late comers.

Tl:dr

Meme coins are taking money from middle class, wealthy, fomo'ers.... And giving it to the poor via meme coins.",1635089099,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeubre/crypto_currency_the_great_shift/

More than likely you will have fomo every day as rich people are trying to get rich doing the opposite of whatever you are doing.

If you want a reliable goal I would consider investing in functional alt coins.  Meme coins usually don't last past one or two pumps.  Currently I am invested in Proton,  and if you have the MetalPay app there are little to no fees from withdrawing.  I take out 50$ a day and I end up keeping 45.50.  Even better its instant transactions during business days so don't worry about the 3-5 day crap.  Also the Proton team will respond super quickly if you have an issue and email them.  They are also very active in r/Protonchain.

This is just a small example,  but crytpos like this are going to survive the long run.  Functionality is getting stronger too as the big coins show their flaws.  These types of coins are going to aggressively compete with each other,  and if you want a long lasting and solid community these are the ones to invest in.",1635089052,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeub82/those_of_you_upset_about_shib_functional_alt/

# What is it?

EOS is a blockchain platform designed to develop decentralized applications (DApps). Its operation is similar to the Ethereum platform, with the exception that it is faster and more scalable. It enable developers to build decentralized applications more efficiently. EOS is a project strongly focused on solving many of the problems of blockchain technology, especially from those who keep it away from massification and global adoption. To achieve this, it has a number of fundamental pillars to satisfy, they are:

* **Free use:** the platform must offer flexibility to developers and users to offer free services. This indicates a more widespread adoption of the technology.
* **Recovery from errors:** the platform must be robust enough to correct errors when they inevitably occur.
* **Sequential performances:** there are some applications that simply cannot be implemented with parallel algorithms due to sequential dependent steps. For this reason, the platform must support fast sequential performance.
* **Parallel performance:** large-scale applications need to divide the workload across multiple CPUs and computers.

# How does it work?

In this aspect, EOS is similar to Ethereum. The capabilities of both to enable distributed application development are immense. However, there are important technical points where EOS has some advantage.  Among these points are:

* Ability to provide accounts, authentication systems and databases.
* Asynchronous communication between nodes.
* Parallel application programming to exploit the potential of multiple CPU cores and / or clusters.
* High scalability.
* Elimination of fees and commissions.
* Quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.
* Simple upgrade system.
* Error recovery.

Another important point is that it has a consensus protocol designed for high scalability. In developing EOS, the team decided to implement the **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).** In this way, all those who possess EOS tokens will be able to choose to produce blocks thanks to a voting and approval system. Money production is permissive. That is, a user can produce blocks in proportion to the votes he accumulates. The network can produce one block every 0.5 seconds and batches of 126 blocks every time.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for EOS are Scatter, EOS-voter, SimplEOS and Exodus If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger is the right choice

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. High scalability
2. Great roadmap and devs team
3. Low transaction fees

**Cons**

1. Transactions are not anonymous
2. Not completely decentralized",1635088639,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeu69r/knowyourcrypto_39_eos_eos/

67,CryptoCurrency,lordofming-rises,Which marketplace would you monthly DCA in?,"Hello!
I have been considering just buying the top 10 coins per marketcap and this every month like 500 dollars with 25 percent for BTC and ETH and the other 50 percent for the 8 other coins.

With that I am expecting to have some gains at least on some coins and avoid FOMOing everywhere and instead I would do a check every end of month and sell the ones that didn't perform well  and rebalance for again the 10 new marketcap (removing tether and maybe take another coin like ONE or FTM that has also promising uptrend).

Now I wonder on which plateform doing that, because I have Jade card for Crypto.com and I have one or two coins on Binance and Kraken.

For me crypto.com seems easier because I usually top up anyway every months for my groceries on it so adding a little bit more would avoid me transfering twice. But the spread is shit. Is that difficult to transfert to exchange en then use exchange? 

What are your thoughts?  And is it wise my strategy or is it just plain dumb and I should go all in Shib (which soon will be on marketcap 10 aha)

Is it a scam and am missing key info or are they just not buying articles like a lot of alt coins do?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a language barrier bias? They are based in Asia and maybe people are sus because of that but I think the idea is straight forward.

They make games and users pay for stuff, including NFTs, with the currency in the game.

Most popular games are freemium now and this just sees users spend crypto rather than fiat.

94,CryptoCurrency,kirtash93,Cryptotrivial contest 2021: Round 32! A technical analysis indicator that measures market volatility. It's made of two sidelong bands and a simple moving average. | 24/10/2021,"Welcome to **Round 32 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 32: A technical analysis indicator that measures market volatility. It's made of two sidelong bands and a simple moving average.  

The correct answer of **Round 31** is...

# Block Header!

**What is a Block Header:**

The block header is a section in a block that serves as a summary of the rest of the block. It’s made up of all the metadata – such as the time and difficulty when the block was mined, the Merkle root of the included transactions, and the nonce. Also present is the previous block’s hash, which is what allows us to create the “chain” of blocks. In essence, the block header contains any data that isn’t the list of raw transactions itself.

A block header is what the miners hash to try and make the block valid. This is a lot more efficient than hashing the entirety of the block, which can be made up of thousands of transactions. It would be vastly more cumbersome for a miner to change the nonce and to rehash a whole 2MB block for every attempt. Compare this with hashing Bitcoin’s block headers, for instance, which have a fixed length of 80 bytes. 

Block headers are great from a mining point of view, but because of their small size, they’re also ideal for light clients. The Bitcoin blockchain is too large for devices like smartphones to store. If the chain had 100,000 1MB blocks, you’d consume 100GB of space. But with just the block headers for those same blocks, you’d only take up 0.008GB, or 8MB.

In this way, devices with less bandwidth or storage space can still perform some degree of validation. Because the Merkle root encapsulates all of the transactions, they can later check whether a transaction was included in a particular block. This does come at a cost – the user must still rely on a third party to provide them with necessary information. With that said, light clients are preferable to a system where the users perform no verification at all.

10,CryptoCurrency,Jasquirtin,A reminder Shib will NOT hit 1 penny,"As shib is pumping we have many new people entering the space from their favorite YouTuber or person on Twitter telling them to buy shib. And it sure as hell is working to this point congrats. 

But the problem is many of you newbies don’t understand MC I just got flamed for pointing out to two people that shiba will not EVER hit a penny (.01). I was accused of it being just like BTC to 10k and doge to 50 cent. Okay no shib is like neither of those. 

Let’s revisit market cap shall we? The market cap is a metric we use to compare coins to one another it’s THE thing to check when you want to know potential price action of a coin. MC= circulating supply x current market price. BTC is the #1 coin at 1.1T (1 decimal place) MC. You can calculate that with $60,300 (current Market price) x 17 million (circulating supply). No one with a brain should believe your coin will surpass this. 

Let’s look at shib shall we. A current MC of 17 billion. It’s got some room to run sure. Will it get to a penny? No shot. Why? MC. To get to 1 cent shib will need to 238x from here. That would be a market cap of 17B x 238 = over 4T. All of crypto is currently 2.55T. It’s NOT HAPPENING THIS RUN. 

If you are new I hope this helps cause I doubt your influencer who told you to buy explained this. If you made money great but no your $50 will not 300x you will not hit $1 the supply continues to go up daily making it even harder. I hope this helps.",1635086711,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qetk4i/a_reminder_shib_will_not_hit_1_penny/
11,CryptoCurrency,BradlyL,The (terrifying) % of Totaly Supply of Cryptocurrencies Currently Owned by the Top 100 Addresses...Do you know what (who) you're investing in?,"Like many, when I got into crypto many years ago, I was personally attracted to the idea of a decentralized network, which isn't owned by an elite few, or some middle-man.

Today, it seems the average newcomer has little to no interest in this principle. Moreover, I find it interesting that many who've even been interested/invested in cryptocurrency, continue to show minimal interest in some core principles of economics, such as: Market capitalization, 'Tokenomics', reading a whitepaper, trading/investment principals....and possibly most disturbingly **Distribution of Tokens (wealth)!** 

Imagine for a moment a small elite group of 100 people, in control of assets used by millions. Able to manipulate the market at will, and cash in on their centralized game at any time...Its a scary fate to imagine, especially if you're one of those players in their game.

The truth is that this isn't imaginary....it's quite literally what the current cyrpto market looks like...

Enter, **Shiba Inu....Where 82.14%** of all tokens are owned by just 100 people! 

Or even worse **Binance...Where 98.8% of USD coin** and **95.57% of Binance Coin** is owned by the Top 100 holders.

I know what you're thinking...another post shaming SHIBA, blah, blah, blah....Well, you're right. But, they're not alone. Let's take a look at some of the other most popular crypto currencies, and how they match up (w. sources):

With Shib hitting a new ATH, it seems that many people in this sub are upset that the coin itself didn’t go crashing down and losing everyone’s money. But this confuses me because majority of people looked down on the coin instead of just taking a bit of lottery money and tossing it in for the heck of it like how everyone else is.

First, I would disclose that I tossed 300$ in the project around March. And I seen that grow to immense sense amounts and also fall insanely just as quick. Yes, I held despite looking at all the posts saying “scam, rug pulls... etc.” but at the end of the day, it was just a experiment in crypto. The fundamentals are not as “professional” or solid as other coins, but the coin has still delivered on its projects that it promised the people. Instead, people still called it a shitcoin.

Why do people let their pride get in their way of making money? Many companies know the coin has so much hype around it that it be foolish for them to not list it. The amount that was made from doge itself by robinhood was insane and I have a feeling the same can be said around this coin.

Just be happy for those that invested because they risked their money. And their money is just as hard earned as your money.

Now if you feel like you missed out, wait for the coin to stabilize or drop, and just toss some spare into it so that next time when it pulls the unthinkable, at least you are in it for the ride too.

The crypto world is still new. There is plenty of room to hold “real” projects and still play with “shitcoin”. It is actually quite entertaining with the community.",1635086629,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qetj9h/whats_with_all_the_shib_hate/

Ever heard of stock options?","Alright so I just woke up, did my morning routine of obsessive chart checking, and scrolled to my favorite subreddit and first thing I see is a post about Shib ATH and Doge having a nice run up making a poor fella feel like shit. 

WELL GUESS WHAT? YOU’RE NOT OWED ANYTHING. You clearly saw the Doge run earlier this year, and have witnessed first hand how a coin with no fundamentals can launch itself to life changing amounts of money. Many people actually were drawn to crypto from this. At the end of the Doge run, I’m sure we all had a small hint of thought “SHIB would do something similar.” And if I’m being blatantly honest, I had a gut feeling that it would 100% have some type of run. But I didn’t put anything in myself either. And I am not complaining. You know why? 

Because if you go to my hometown, R/wallstreetbets, one that I’m sure we are all familiar with, you will see that they work with STOCK OPTIONS, much of which can make fortunes or losses overnight and has been literally equated to GAMBLING. What is gambling build upon? You guessed it, HYPE. You and I both knew this had a tiny minuscule chance of launching but we decided to go the safe and long method of investing in “strong fundamental coins” that we likely don’t even know shit about. The market is ALWAYS BUILT ON HYPE. Even your “strong fundamentals coin” had hype at some point. 

So when I hear all this nonsense complaining about the “wrong coin going up” I want to remind everybody that none of us are entitled to anything, and that YOU AREN’T PLAYING THE SAME GAME AS SHIB AND DOGE HOLDERS, and if they make some money well then f’n be happy for them because you are also hoping one day you get there too right? 

This crab mentality needs to stop. If you want to invest safely, do it. If you want to gamble with shit coins, do it. If you want to fly to Vegas and bet all your life savings on black, do it.

I usually get that information from CoinDance and UsefulTulips in both pages, the numbers are totally distorted.

Looks like the LocalBitcoin API got crazy after the six zeroes were removed.

Usually it was around 50-30 BTC weekly, after LocalBitcoin lost it's leadership with the introduction of Binance in Venezuela (doing a crazy marketing campain), also there are other options like reserve and airtm.

Some facts about Venezuela:

* Monthly minimum wage is 10 Bs. (Around 2-2.5 USD)
* Average wage is around 80 USD monthly
* A family needs around 400 USD monthly to ""live"" (5 members) according to some NGO.

Most people use crypto to receive remittances from abroad, cash out when mining (electricity is kinda free but unreliable, hours blackouts are common), getting paid and even the goverment uses it for sure (sadly).

I like how crypto evolved with me, sometimes being my hobby during my free time but sometimes I just let it go for some time when I'm busy.


I would recommend you it to forgive yourself for buying high and don't let yourself sell low, but also invest in coins you believe in.
Who said that when bitcoin and the family were at 30k the investment would run to 120% gain. 
Every time I hated a certain coin because it didn't move even a 1% up , i kept buying it because deep down I felt it has a good project. And then the coin payed my patience making at least 100% gains, last one was algorand when I got in at the 1.00$ price it was still for at least 5 months then it boomed.

Last but not least the best strategy for me was to let crypto heal when the market is down, but at the same time buy the best discounted coins. Also I don't bother myself even getting to read post in this sub about people losing stuff or taking profit because they make me want to sell.


The most important thing to tell the youngsters like me is that you don't need the crypto money currently, you can come up with other ways to do your things.

87,CryptoCurrency,Jeronemoo,A quick introduction to VRA,"# Introduction

You've seen VRA or Verasity mentioned here and there, perhaps you've heard about their plight to defeat online ad fraud. People are hyped, but you don't really know what Verasity does. In this post I'm going to give you a quick overview of the problem they aim to solve and their solution.  
Summary at the bottom for those that dislike large posts.

# Which industry is Verasity aiming for?

The problem they aim to solve has everything to do with the online ad tech industry. In a single sentence: 

&gt;Online ad tech industry, or online AdTech, refers to a network of interconnected technologies working to make sure the right people get the right ads at the right time. 

The online part is important, because the *online* AdTech industry is growing at an incredible rate. The online AdTech industry spending worldwide was calculated to be around [378 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, growing to an estimated 646 billion U.S. dollars by 2024](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/)!

So basically all the work that is done in order for you to see, and hopefully interact with, an ad, online. Ads on website, mobile phones, TVs, tablets, any digital device. All tools needed to design, build, serve &amp; maintain those ads.  
All of that, is the **online AdTech industry**.

[Seriously, there's a lot going on before you see an ad](https://preview.redd.it/9ke2y514iev71.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1782964ce6a7de1eeffd32d5ead42653c91eb79)

# Which problems does the online ad tech industry face?

Brands don't always know exactly where their ads end up, or who views them. Invalid traffic, [bots roaming around](https://www.anura.io/blog/what-is-a-bot-and-how-do-bots-impact-digital-ad-campaigns), is another issue. Basically, as a Brand, you have no clue what you're paying for, you lack insights, you don't know if you reached the target audience. A complete lack of transparency.

Lack of transparency and fraud go hand in hand. The fact is, that online AdTech is growing so fast that technology couldn't (or wouldn't) keep up with fraudsters. According to [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/report/Poor-Quality-Ads-Cost-US-Marketers-74-Billion-In-2016/RES136115), as much as **64% of ad fraud** **happens in the video ads sector.** Here are [some more statistics](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-advertising/video-advertising/worldwide), to give you an idea of the issues brands face:

https://preview.redd.it/0bgbuxnljev71.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe23dc229830ea3f93c5af146bef3047ebed9093

To quote a [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEUCOsphoI0) (worth it to watch) given by P&amp;G CBO Marc Pritchard in 2017;

&gt;We have a media supply chain that is murky at best, Fraudulent at worst.

 

All in all, the online AdTech industry has a whole bunch of issues, video ad fraud being the biggest one. That is the one Verasity aims to solve.

# How does Verasity aim to solve these?

We have established, above, that a lot of issues in the online AdTech industry stem from lack of transparency, we all know [blockchain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp) inherently has this transparency.

Verasity has developed an ad platform called VeraViews. This platform makes use of Verasity's patented Proof of View technology to solve the issues mentioned above.

**Proof of View**  
Proof of View (PoV) is a patented Verasity technology that uses artificial intelligence, over 200 touchpoints, and third-party detection vendor partners to determine whether an ad is actually viewed by a person or not, in real time. PoV analyzes the data gathered and determines if the ad view is valid or fake. A valid ad engagement (a person viewed the ad) is stored on the blockchain afterwards, where it can't be tampered with.

All of this is done with your privacy in mind; No personal linkable data is stored.

# The solution: VeraViews

VeraViews is Verasity's platform that uses PoV to solve the above mentioned issues in the online AdTech industry. It is a complete advertising system allowing brands to upload their ad campaigns directly to take advantage of publisher ad space on their sites.

That means VeraViews cuts out the middleman; Money spent on ads is split between those that create all the value.

That's not all, here's some more added value VeraViews brings to the table;

* VeraViews offers full transparency to all parties in the advertising value chain, privacy compliant.
* Thanks to PoV every ad view paid for is an actual ad viewed by a person, eliminating ad fraud altogether.
* Publisher can get paid right away, instead of waiting months on end.

Simply put, VeraViews is a platform that Brands can easily use to create their ad campaigns, publish them and control them, all the while granting them all the benefits mentioned above. If you're up for a more in-depth technical explanation, I'd suggest you read[ this blog](https://medium.com/verasity/veraviews-ad-tech-platform-roll-out-proof-of-view-4815ba5e71eb). 

# Summary

To summarise what we've iterated over;

* The online AdTech industry makes sure the right people get the right ad at the right time.
* An enormous amount of ad money is lost on ad fraud due to lack of transparency, especially in the video ads sector.
* Verasity has created a ""Proof of View"" technology that can verify if an ad is viewed by a person, or by a bot.
* Verasity has created an easy-to-use ad platform called ""VeraViews"" that uses the PoV technology to eliminate ad fraud, while improving transparency and payment terms.",1635083629,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qesm1h/a_quick_introduction_to_vra/

But sometimes they aren’t hard. Some of the people who have made big money don’t understand very basic investing principles and got lucky. Sometimes even [hamsters](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/25/1040683057/crypto-trading-hamster-goxx-warren-buffet-s-p-500)  make above-average traders.

Don’t be bitter for missing out on the latest 10x coin. That emotion won’t help you succeed, and it will make you miserable. If you know someone who has made money but you have missed out, congratulate them, maybe even try to learn from the experience. But often there really isn’t much to learn other than their token(s) took off and yours didn’t/haven’t yet and your trading plan might still be just fine, it just wasn’t your day.

I wish you all success. If you stick around long enough I believe you will make some profit, just don’t expect 10x gains by end of the year because, like I said, most of us miss out on most pumps, and that’s just the way it is.",1635082214,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qes7bb/you_will_probably_miss_out_on_most_most_crypto/
41,CryptoCurrency,breaker004,Is there a way to report or take down fake exchanges?,"Beware of fake exchanges. 

They will offer you a new coin saying it is private going public in a period of time. As you monitor the coin, it goes up in an incredible rate. You'll be tempted to invest as they befriend you. They're patiently deceiving you to invest.

You'll meet them at a dating site or other social media trying to be nice.

These exchanges offer interest for locking your money with them. There are amount levels you're going to reach as you increase your pledged money. You can withdraw small amounts but once you pull everything out, they'll ask for income tax before approval of your withdrawal, but you can never get them back.

Do not trust anyone offerring a huge sum of profit. Make sure the coin you are investing have whitepaper in it. Do your own research.

I happen to search this list, and I wanna share this with you. You can post fake exchanges here so we can help each other expose scammers.

Algorand is an open-source, decentralized blockchain network that leverages a two-tiered structure and a unique variation of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to increase transaction speeds and achieve finality. Algorand’s block rewards are distributed to all ALGO coin holders, offering all ALGO holders an opportunity to earn rewards instead of just block producers.

VeChain

VeChain is a blockchain platform designed to enhance supply chain management and business processes. Its goal is to streamline these processes and information flow for complex supply chains through the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT).

The Vechain platform contains two distinct tokens: VeChain Token (VET) and VeChainThor Energy (VTHO). The former is used to transfer value across VeChain’s network, and the latter is used as energy or ""gas"" to power smart contract transactions.

What is YOUR story??
When did you hear about cryptocurrency, what was your first impression, what is your impression now and most importantly what event/coin changed your mind (if it changed that is).

I'll start:

A friend of mine was the one who introduced me into crypto back in 2013... Of course the coin he was into was Bitcoin.. I was immediately into it and was researching heavily.. my first actual investment though was in 2015.. and it was Litecoin... I purchased it at $3 and hold to it until 2017 , where I sold it for $54... I was a uni student at the time, and making an 18x on my investment was just.. unbelievable.. even as I was withdrawing the money I was still feeling like I was doing something illegal/wrong... Fast forward and i got to cry when it flewww to over $350 (and his big brother BTC over 19k).. and then feel like I dodged a bullet when it fell under $25.. After that , with uni life, and me losing interest, I didn't get into crypto again till October of 2020.. my next coins were dogecoin , which I honestly got just for the memes (bought over 13000 of them for $100 and another 100.000 of them for $2000).. and sold them for $14000... I've been holding MATIC ever since.. Polygon and it's network are just.. so appealing to me.. and i don't really see it going under the price I bought it for ($0.098).. So yeah, it will remain on staking, until I am satisfied with the amount and sell some of it.
No idea what my next coin will be, and how the crypto space will look until then, all I know for sure is I never see a time where I will ever NOT hold ANY crypto ever again.

93,CryptoCurrency,MatteoFloreaYT,Some ways to make free crypto,"NOTE: This are some methods that work for ME, it’s better to find what works for you but if your lost you can try these.

Risk Free Methods

1.Mining

Just a great way for passive income, made like $100, I use kryptex for mining eth and vertcoin one click miner for mining vtc.

Pros: Passive Income
Cons: Electricity bill

2.Coinbase Rewards

Really easy to do, made around $50.

Pros: Easy
Cons: None

3.Crypto Royale

Fun game, made $10.

Pros: Easy, fun
Cons: None

Some Risk Involved Methods

1.Day trading

It can be easy, just don’t loose money, never sell at a lower price, made $10 (I didn’t have much money to start with). You can use binance for day trading.

Pros: Can make a lot of money
Cons: Requires money to start with, Some risk involved

2.Staking/Farming

You can stake stable coins on binance, made $10 (I didn’t have much money to start with)

Pros: Passive income
Cons: Some risk involved (little to no risk when staking stable coins)

Other ways to earn money (not crypto)

1.Survey sites

I use isay, made $100 just from doing them in my free time. Minimum withdraw is £5, you can withdraw in giftcards or virtual credit card.

Pros: No risk
Cons: You don’t get payed in crypto

I thing to note is that i’m 15 so money is much more valuable for me, $100 is a lot for me. So please don’t hate if you can’t buy a lambo from these methods 😁.",1635079858,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qerjro/some_ways_to_make_free_crypto/

Really consider the percentage chance that shib becomes the target of a massive altcoin season by retail, institutions and people rolling money back through the market.

Brave is quite good too!
2. Now use Presearch as your search engine in combination with Brave, it'll take a very long time to cash out but if you're consistent it's totally free crypto just for ""googling"" things like normal. 
3. Try Theta's cache worker, it pays you for acting as a content delivery network. Just put folding on idle! You'll receive t-fuel for uptime and bigger pay whenever streaming job comes through. Totally automatic and doesn't affect your performance. 
4. Less automated is Crypto Royale game, some earn up to $1 an hour but you must swap the roy for one on viperswap because cashing out through the game pays a fraction in comparison. 
5. You can use Nicehash to mine at home, gaming computers with newer Nvdia 3000 series can make $5 a day then just convert to coins you want. Laptops can overheat so keep that in mind.
6. If you're feeling really degen you can start turdposting on this sub, fortnite sub, or the Ethereum sub and earn the respective communities coin which when done effectively some claim to make $800 maybe more a month. Very time consuming.

9,CryptoCurrency,heyheoy,"2008 financial crisis post is misleading, 47 bankers have been jailed, half of them just on Iceland.","Forty-seven bankers were sentenced to jail time for their role in the financial crisis, Financial Times research has found, dispelling the myth that no one was held personally accountable for the financial sector’s catastrophic failures.

The FT searched records and news reports from across Europe and the US to uncover how many bank employees and directors recieved jail sentences for issues directly linked to the crisis or the collapse of their institutions.

The data does not include traders and other bank staff jailed for their role in interest rate rigging, like the two [Deutsche Bank traders jailed](https://www.ft.com/content/c970a0c0-8b53-11e8-b18d-0181731a0340) for interest rate rigging earlier this year, or for rogue trading not directly linked to the crisis or a bank collapse, like UBS’s Kweku Adoboli, who is now [facing deportation](https://www.ft.com/content/3c77180c-a1a6-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4).

Iceland had far and away the highest incidence of jailing, accounting for 25 of cases. The country seized control of its banks in October 2008 and imposed capital controls which ran for eight years to stave off chaos.

Chief executives, account managers, traders and chairmen from four banks were sentenced to term of between six months and five and a half years for everything from market manipulation to ‘gross breach of fiduciary duty’.

Luckily for them, Iceland has some of the [plushest jails](https://grapevine.is/mag/articles/2011/09/27/doingtimeiniceland/) in the world, with an ethos framed around rehabilitation rather than punishment. Prisoners are allowed flat screens TVs up to 26 inches, personal computers and games, and can apply to leave as often as once a month after they have served a third of their sentence.

Eleven Spanish bankers were sentenced to jail time for issues relating to Spain’s 2012 banking collapse, [most notably Rodrigo Rato](https://www.ft.com/content/7f93082e-f9ed-11e6-bd4e-68d53499ed71), the former head of the International Monetary Fund who chaired Bankia in the run up to its collapse.

Ireland, where the €67bn bank bailout bill forced the country into a sovereign bailout, jailed seven, but convictions of two bankers — Bernard Daly and Tiarnan O’Mahoney — were later quashed.

The most controversial was the case of Aoife Maguire, a former assistant manager at Anglo Irish Bank who was convicted of ordering the deletion of records relating to the accounts of former chief executive Sean FitzPatrick. Ireland’s Court of Appeal ultimately found her eighteen month sentence was “unnecessarily severe”, and shortened it to nine months, four of which were suspended.

The US, ground zero for the financial crisis, has jailed just one banker for issues relating to the crisis. Former Credit Suisse trader Kareem Serageldin was sentenced to thirty months in prison for artificially inflating the price of subprime mortgages, a financial product at the very heart of Wall Street’s unravelling.

She actually needed an iphone, but was not ready to accept such an expensive gift from me, as she felt bit uneasy accepting such an expensive gift.
And I didn't want to gift her jewellery, it just doesn't feel right to me somehow.
And after lots of thinking I finally decided that I'll gift her something that appreciates over time, and not depreciates, and might actually change her life down the line, unlike an iphone or a necklace. So, I decided to buy her a bitcoin (not a whole bitcoin ofcourse, I was in love, but not to that extent :-P). 
Thing is she's not at all into investments. So, one more reason behind gifting her a bitcoin was to introduce her to the world of investments, a world where she would rather have $1000 in stocks/cryptos, than an iphone.
So, I asked her to install Binance and get verified, so that I can transfer her her's bitcoin. (Before you guys starts judging ne, I feel my rationale behind the Binance selection instead of a private wallet should be self explanatory). 
And she's like, this is the most uncool gift ever. For a gift also you want me to do all the hardwork with downloading app, ID verification, and understand how things work? You SUCK!
Ofcourse, she understand my rationale behind gifting her this, atleast in theory, and didn't mean the above. And hopefully in future she will practically realise that this was indeed the best gift ever, and hopefully it changes her life for the better.

The developers seem to be taking any obstacle or concern about utility or security and creating a legitimate solution to them.

I think the devs behind this coin might just be the first to take a shitcoin and reinvent it into something that one day rivals any other blockchain offering perhaps except ETH.

And the adoption is undeniable… currently SHIB is almost on every major crypto exchange with a huge and very active community.

Last but not least is everyone’s commitment to BURNING a bunch of those 1 quadrillion coins that are available. Everyone involved is hell-bent that coins will be burned so that the price eventually goes past one cent and it seems that is inevitable. Binance burned almost 1B coins yesterday just because they felt like it I guess.

Does anyone know of a process I could see and send this lost NFT from the Binance.US SOL wallet to any SOL support wallet?

Ignore people that have no idea what they talk about.","Many of us tend to listen to much to investing advices from people that never invested in their lives. Maybe they want well for you, but they have literally zero rights, zero knowledge  and zero evidence to support their opinions. They talk bullshit like most of the society about anything they have no idea about. They act like experts, when their situation  prove they can control even their own lives. Hell if full of people that had good intentions.

It is called Dunning-Krueger effect. People that know nothing or little about something tend to overestimate their skills, when masters with a lot of experience underestimate their skills and knowledge.  Just average uncle Joe that  would train national team better that professional trainer, govern country better than all politicians and know more how to make heart surgery than doctors that studied  medicine for 10 years, even if he have no education for any of those things. If you do not listen to people like that in everyday situations why the hell would you took any financial advices from them?

People who earn little more than  minimum wage, never invested in their lives, have 30k$ debt  and can't get promotion in job last 20 years will tell you investing in crypto is bad for your financial situation cause brother of friend of their postman invested in something in 1987 and lost everything.

Most people that achieve nothing are scared about anything new. Do not travel cause it is waste of money. Do not change job for better one, cause you will end under a bridge. Do not earn new languages do not invest. Do not do this or that. They just want you to have lfe like them. But ask yourself do you invest in crypto to really be like them or to achive something more?

If someone don't invest in anything especially not in crypto all their advices are worth nothing. They have no qualifications. And good intentions is not any reason to give advices about things you have no idea about. Better to took advices for real investors or business men that at least have some knowledge and achivement to support their opinions. Of course they are also not neutral.

I have solution to all of those problems. 110% proof. No bullshit, no scam, just straight forward action in any way in any direction you ever dreamed. I bet it sounds impossible but its not. This really works. Once inna lifetime quarantee. This is gonna bring you your Lambo in one week or less.

INVEST IN ME

Yes. Invest in me. Pay me for manipulating market in a way no one can say market has been manipulated.

This is how it works;

I need to own some of that target crypto X. You want it dip? Let me put sell order to higher price, its a damn sure it will start dipping with that same second i press ""ok"" button. 100% sure price will start to avoid that higher price like it would have a ebola.

You need boost? All i need to sell that crypto X on some peak and start to wait lower price so i could fill my bags again. Its a damn sure it will launch to moon soon as i have sold that crypto. 

If you dont believe me, i have made good example about what i can do during last week. _Every single_ sudden massive boost or dip is my fault. I just used my method. They had nothing to do with luck or any other nonsense. 

To make sure you believe me i have made signature boost, i sold 100m Shib same day it started to boost. Not much, but thats not the point. Point is this really happens. I am the reason why different cryptos go suddenly up or down.

35,CryptoCurrency,amandamichelle90,Unless you read yesterday’s lotto numbers and sulk everyday for not picking them - don’t worry about coins that pumped without you,"For the past year, the sentiment around memecoin holders has been *”I feel bad for them — pouring their life savings into this and will lose it all”* but anyone still holding is likely into large profits on a few of them. They didn’t take your advice, they didn’t apply your logic and it worked out for them.

If you truly felt bad for them before, be happy that it worked out. If you’re upset for not doing what they did, that’s kinda silly.. coins pump everyday without us on board some of us just have a less chaotic strategy. 

This isn’t unique to crypto, people invest their time, energy and money into risky things that pan out all the time. In life there will be daily choices you make and don’t make that land you more or less money — it’s just less measurable than it is in Crypto, you’re less aware of the exact decision and what the alternative would have gained you.",1635077569,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeqywp/unless_you_read_yesterdays_lotto_numbers_and_sulk/
38,CryptoCurrency,ObsoleteGentile,FOMO is fine,"It’s 100% OK to FOMO into a memecoin, so long as:

1.	You truly understand what it is, and are aware the money could disappear forever.
2.	You understand and observe risk management.

That’s it. Crypto is a way to enhance your future wealth and advance your retirement date. Play intelligently and responsibly and you will probably do that.

But it’s also pretty fun and exciting, especially for newcomers to the investment world. So why not have some fun, and take a small, non-life-changing moonshot now and then?

I’m not talking about risking half your portfolio, or even 10%. This is where the risk management comes in. Try maybe one or two percent of some recent gains. For example, say your responsible investments have made you $50K over the last two years. Feels good, right? Would $49.5K really feel that much worse??

That’s why during the DOGE run earlier this year I threw in 500 bucks, over a couple of buys, including one brief margin play. Worst case scenario is I’m out 1% of gains that were already…well, gains. House money. The play worked and I got out at the right time.

Had I invested everything, I’d be faced with the daily decision of which Aston Martin I would drive to look at new mansions. But no, it didn’t change my life. It gave me over $4000 in free money, though, and stopped me from feeling like I had entirely missed out on a big deal. I immediately put $3000 of that into safer investments and kept the rest for other fun plays. Now I’ve got a decent position on another shitcoin.

Even if that position is worth 5 figures now, I could lose it all by holding. But if I do, what have I really lost? Answer: 25% of 1% of some gains I made in my much larger positions in more responsible investments. And the whole time those responsible positions have been there, poised for my future.

So while you’re perfectly free to say NO on principle to memecoins at any amount, under any circumstances, just remember: this decision is purely personal. You’re not hurting the meme coin by staying out, and you’re not “helping crypto stay respectable,” because no matter what you think, there are more than enough boneheads kamikaze-ing into shitcoins that your abstinence has no bearing. It’s just you doing you.

But if you feel like potentially throwing away a half percent or so of your gains, you might just end up with sushi money. For a whole year. Which ain’t nothin’.",1635077260,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeqw5n/fomo_is_fine/

I’m currently only in one coin, gradually micro-buying until I have enough to stake and build some passive earnings. I plan to invest in some more coins, but I’m wondering how far to go. I’m a middle age, low-mid income guy with a family, so I don’t have a lot of money to toss around. I’m hoping to dodge working till I die, and at my age, a 401(k) ain’t the way. Bear in mind, I’m a small-time investor looking at (and hoping for) the long term. Think $100/month or so. I avoid discussing what coins I’m looking at to dodge the flames, but here goes:
I’m currently in XLM. Planning to sink my spare dollars in until I can stake. Thinking ADA, ALGO, and ETH for the future; same plan, pile into one until I can stake, then move to the next. I’m considering ETH to be more or less stable, so I want *some* money in there. 
So, in a roundabout way, here’s my question: how diverse is diverse enough? Is four coins a decent goal?  Should I be aiming higher? Or pick two and sink into them?

I am not seeking financial advice. Just some hopefully informed opinions from folks that have been there, and done at least some of that.",1635076974,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeqtd1/ok_one_more_try_diversity/

61,CryptoCurrency,good-as-hellx,"If You Really Care About Crypto And Blockchain, You Should Treat It Accordingly","I've just read someone's post about how SHIB has the potential to reach a spot among top coins because of it's **utility, white paper and upcoming events.** Among many other posts that state the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Dogecoin is #9 with a **$32.6 billion market cap**, Shiba is #12 with a **$17.5 billion market cap** while most of the people cry hard about how crypto is about *future, technology, decentralization, freedom* and what fucking not.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that we're all here mostly because we want a better life and gains are still gains, but is this really it?

66,CryptoCurrency,savage-dragon,"Whether you 'win' from crypto or not, crypto has taught a generation valuable financial skills that neither school nor 9-5 jobs would have managed to. It doesn't take much for the average crypto newbie to realize how fucked up the governmental money printing process is.","**Alright lemme shill you a real solid coin:**

\- 30% of supply minted this year alone

\- Loses 99% of value since the genesis block

\- Minted by 1 single node

\- Node controlled by anon dev team

\- Currency can be mined in toxic mines with shitty ethics and pretty shitty fellow miners

The joke here is that what I'm shilling you is simply the US dollar, or any fiat currency for that matter. All the skills that have come intuitively to you while researching a cryptocurrency, stuff like max supply, market cap, issuance rate, issuance proofs, hash functions, token burns, etc.? These are the sorts of skills that fiat dev teams wish you never learnt, because they know if you ever did, you'd be up in arms.

 *It is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.* 

   *--- Henry Ford*

Those are just the skills you learned intuitively the first day into crypto. Those are just skills related to fiscal policies.

If you never studied economics or business or finances in university, don't worry, because when it comes to fiscal policies, most university only shove basic stuff down your throats and regurgitate the same bullshit that's been going on since the Nixon era. They simply tell you that this Keynesian method is the norm nowadays without telling you its flaws. They never explain to you why only 1 single node gets to control the amount of fiat mined. They never explain to you why dev team is mostly anon. They simply want you to accept things as they are and as they will always be. 

Cryptocurrency gives you the firsthand experience as to why things are bad the ways they were and that things don't always have to be this way.

**But what about other skills? Aside from fiscal policies, what else have you learned that you take for granted in crypto?**

Keep in mind that the majority of adult Americans are basically financially illiterate, and believe it or not, Americans already represent the peak of humanity's education. (In coming hurr durr dumb American jokes from Europeans for sure) But let's move on.

How many people do you know are dumb as rocks when it comes to money management? How many constantly take on debts, live way above their means, have no savings or safety nets, waste money on drug addiction, gambling and poor decisions?

Now let's see what crypto has taught us during the bootcamp courses:

DCA. Sacrifice today for a 1000x better future. Don't let banks steal your yields, take charge of your yields. Research into each crypto's portfolio. 

Plus other financial tools and concepts like: reading charts, margins, leverages, future contracts, intellectual property ownerships, cryptography, safe online hygiene, macroeconomics models, technical analyses, etc.

Unless you were already in stock before crypto, these concepts are completely foreign to you. The stock market has a higher barrier to entry than crypto, and the majority crypto people in their early 20s without any prior financial experience had to learn all these concepts themselves. Were it not for crypto, many of these people would have been stuck working a normal job, not giving a shit about the global money market or any of these financial concepts.

**So yes winning in crypto is awesome. But keep in mind that crypto has already armed you with an extremely powerful knowledge. Remind yourselves that this knowledge had been hidden to 99% of the public prior to the advent of crypto. By being so transparent with its monetary policies, crypto has exposed how non-transparent and corrupt the fiat world is.**",1635076227,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeqmn2/whether_you_win_from_crypto_or_not_crypto_has/

I'm curious about the role of media in terms of getting people into crypto or even creating a real hype for it. 
I read about the BTC cycles, that the periods were/are getting longer and about the possibility for another crash. I think (and i obviously can be wrong) that there is a relation between crypto and the news about crypto affecting each other. (ofc just because some news papers say BTC is going crash, doesn't mean it is crashing)
For that thought of mine about this relation and a possible crash in the future, i was wondering, if the presence of crypto in the media in 2018 could be considered nearly as big as it is today?
And, starting from either the answer is yes or no, how far this could affect the extent of the possible crash in the future?
Of course there are many more factors having an influence on the crypto prices, especially today with billions worth companies investing in cryoto.

There is an Android app named [Velocity VPN](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vpn.proxy.velocity) that uses dPVN to provide free VPN services. They support staking and are currently giving up to \~61% APY. Staking is supported at Cosmostation and Keplr Wallets. The project claims open source code and encrypted, permissionless and  censorship resistant VPN networking. According to the project's website, they will be supporting bandwidth mining, where you can share your internet bandwidth to earn rewards (somewhat similar to [Mysterium](https://mysterium.network/)). Project is still in its early stages and currently only major CEX listing is on KuCoin and DEX listing on [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/).

# Technical:

***How to read the table:***

* The rank represents the times the crypto was mentioned in this sub.
* The values on bearish and bullish columns are the ratio of bullish or bearish comments to how many times the coin was mentioned.
* Reliability index  is percentage of strongest sentiment (except neutral) with respect to all sentiments in the comments and averaged over all the comments. It can also be seen as average sentiment distribution (per comment) for the coin.
* Change 7D (%) is the percentage change in the price of the cryptocurrency in last 7 days.

***Methodology:***

*For Sentiment Analysis:*

* Data collection for sentiments (comments) are performed everyday at 12PM UTC -8:00.
* The comments with less than 6 words are not included in the analysis anymore as many research papers argue them to be low quality sentiments.
* Another filter that is applied that a post or comment should at least have 2 or more upvotes to be included in analysis for this table.
* For this analysis, only one mention of a coin/token per user is considered.
* The sentiment analysis is performed using lexicon model and natural language processing ([nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) module for python).
* Emojis are also considered in sentiment analysis and are demojizied using [Python emoji library](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/).

*For WordCloud and n-gram:*

* A word cloud (aka a tag cloud) is **a visual representation of words** in a picture format. These representations are used to highlight popular words based on frequency and relevance.
* An N-gram means a sequence of N words. For example, for 1-gram or unigram, we consider the frequently occurring single words, for 2-gram or bigram, a sequence of two words and similarly a 3-gram or trigram a sequence of 3 words. They are basically a set of co-occurring words within a given text or in this case, this subreddit.
* For the wordcloud and n-gram analysis, all the comments (without any filters) are collected and popular stop words are removed using ([nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) module for python).
* N-gram analysis is performed using  WordNetLemmatizer from nltk module for python.

***Feedback request***:

* Previous posts with ""Fun Fact"" section is renamed to ""Low Cap Radar"". This section will be used to provide weekly updates on some of the low cap cryptos with interesting use cases. OP is no where affiliated to any of these projects.

24,CryptoCurrency,summerlad86,Taxes question regarding cashing out from Binance.,"Okay so I need some help because I don't know where to start.

Im sorry if this question should be posted elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I have lived in Japan for x years. last year I opened an account on Binance.

On Binance Ive got some crypto (not what ppl would consider a lot but still). These were bought using my Japanese bank account and whilst living and working in Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

Now!

I do not want to pay the tax on crypto here since it is insanely high. Ludacris.

If I decide to leave the country, move back home and cut ties with Japan, do Japan still have the right to tax my income that I have made on the crypto? Since historically, most purchases was made whilst living in Japan and through a Japanese bank.

&amp;#x200B;

Im from a nordic country. My country and Japan has a "" double tax "" arrangement. Meaning that I can not be taxed by both countries for my income. This isapplied to salary and stocks. But! since Crypto is still relatively new I have tried to seek answers from someone that has done something similar but has not been able to find anything.

To give an example. In my home country I have stocks. I sold them. Only taxed in my home country.

Since Binance does not have the right to conduct business in Japan, I would assume that this might also be one of the key factors when coming to not wanting to pay tax for it in Japan... perhaps.

When cashing out from Binance, where does the money come from? Is it a transaction from the HQ in the Seychelles?",1635074018,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeq4si/taxes_question_regarding_cashing_out_from_binance/

32,CryptoCurrency,paulrudder,Question about Koinly / taxes,"I asked for recommendations on here last week for tracking DeFi transactions, and Koinly seemed to be the most highly endorsed. So I figured I'd try it out.

I went to Trust Wallet and clicked on my BSC scan address, then exported my 11 transactions to a CSV file. Then I uploaded that to Koinly and it auto imported everything.

But I have two questions I'm hoping I can get guidance on:

- every transaction shows up as a BNB withdrawal, even though I swapped bnb for alt coins a couple times. Is this accurate? Is every swap shown in BNB because that's the ""root"" coin I used? I guess I was confused why, for example, I cashed out my Baby Doge but I don't see any transactions with baby doge in the title. They all are labeled bnb withdrawals.

- should I include all 11 of my transactions even if some of them were purchases for coins I'm still holding? For example if I include a swap for an altcoin but I haven't sold it yet, would I include the purchase info on this year's tax return or ONLY include it once I do eventually sell the coin? I guess the reason I'm confused is that let's say I decide to hold a coin for 2yrs and then sell it... If I've already included the purchase / cost basis in this year's tax return then wouldn't the cost basis need to be reported again when I sell? So I'd be listing the purchase this year and again two years from now to show what the cost basis was?

Sorry if these are dumb or confusing questions. I know this isn't a tax accountant hangout, but since there are lots of other people who do their crypto taxes here, I thought I may at least get educated replies. I don't think accountants in my conservative town have much experience with crypto /DeFi so I may need to look for some kind of online accounting firm or a chain if people here aren't sure of the answers.",1635073746,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeq2l0/question_about_koinly_taxes/

69,CryptoCurrency,DebateMeLoser,The true risk behind Shiba,"Let me preface by congradulating all the shiba holders for being in profit. Gaining 40% in less than 6 hours is no joke!

Im seeing a lot of disorganization when it comes to explaining the risk behind Shiba especially in the midst of such a rally. I wanted to give some insight into some risks that might have not been considered by some. 

To start I want to reference a video: 
https://youtu.be/r6k7kNr3Q3w

TLDR: The issuing of currency by private banks was a thing around the 1800s closely resembling crypto today. Easy to access capital requirements to open a bank as a business allowed anyone to issue actual curency exchangeable at banks that issued the notes much like a dex. At the peak of the Free Banking era there were roughly 16,000 banks issuing their own notes. The Federal Reserve was created to reign in 'Tiger Banks' who were known for predatory practices. 

So you might be wondering.. what does that have to do with anything? If we have learned anything its that history repeats itself, and we are walking into some shifty waters when it comes to the Ripple court case.

Now dont get me wrong but if that whole case is about disproving that there is an expectation of earnings when purchasing crypto as a contract then thats a tough argument to fight even if were supposedly winning against the SEC. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/crypto-heatmap/

If you look at the categorization of the different coins through cmc youll notice that BTH is called a Store of Value, which when compared does seem like just a currency, with no expectation of returns.

Smart Contracts though? thats rough waters. To say that hodlers of ADA or VET arent 'holding equity of Cardano or VeChain' is a long reach particularily when you look at how they are defined when compared to a traditional security.

Lets bring my points back full circle, because upon a simple glance of Shiba subreddits, to say that there is no exprctation of earnings from shib holders or shib shillers is.. astronomically false.

The institutions that monitor crypto define it best themselves. The cdc heatmap calls shib a memecoin. 

All my points demonstrate that were still remarkably early in cryptos life cycle if compared to history, but its also the wild west of unregulated financial systems, which is great for huge gains but opens up massive risk. 

Shiba and Doge in themselves may be genuine in their beliefs, and managed well enough to not have made the explicit mistake of 'promising gains' that which crosses the line of expectation of earnings, but at its core it is a vehicle to amass wealth, and it is observable by the cesspool of alt cloins that have spawned around shiba.

Im talking coins like Dogebonk, Bone, Dogenomics, BabyShiba, Shibanova, Shiba Floki, Floki Shiba, Minifloki, BabySpaceFloki etc..

These coins have listings on subreddits like 'cryptomoonshots' explicitely promising returns. 

They expose the whole crypto industry and are a massive risk to the credibility of our investments.

I dont want you guys to think im just upset about missing a wave, im sure by this point the experienced investors are used to this type of volatility and everyone has their say to get gains, but the whole category of memecoins is a unignorable vulnerability to the credibility of crypto as a whole and should be discouraged.",1635071559,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeplei/the_true_risk_behind_shiba/

79,CryptoCurrency,Scary_Milk,The one crypto oracle that was always right: Pi Cycle Top Indicator predicting cycle tops,"I‘m not into any TA (technical analysis) stuff, graph interpretation, moon phases or astrology in terms of crypto.

I‘m a classical holder, do my own research when something covers my intention and if I‘m convinced, I invest and just hold. Every coin and token has it‘s time if it‘s a good project and pump and dumps don’t interest me, I‘m here for the long term values.

But since everything is coupled to Bitcoin in crypto and a dumping BTC takes everything down into the abyss, it‘s good to know when BTC peaks to park your investments into a stablecoin until the market starts to recover to have some extra gains.

The index I follow for that cycle tops, which I discovered at my first BTC dump in 2018 is the pi cycle top indicator. It‘s crazy accurate and predicted every cycle top within three days. And yes, also the last cycles top in april 2021.

I don’t even understand the tech side, for your interest: It uses the 111 day moving average (111DMA) and a newly created multiple of the 350 day moving average, the 350DMA x 2. When the 111DMA moves up and crosses the 350DMA x 2 we see that it coincides with the price of Bitcoin peaking. 

The name pi comes from 350 / 111 = 3.153, which is very close to Pi = 3.142. 

For me, it worked very good for the past two cycles and I‘m watching it closely. It’s looking very good right now for BTC by the way and we‘re still at the beginning of this cycle if you believe in Pi.

Do your own research, it‘s just my observation and opinion and I hope it helps someone.

80,CryptoCurrency,XLMisthebest,"My crypto investing strategy, what's yours?","In the grand scheme of things I'm still pretty new to the world of crypto. I did a lot of research and decided that I'd play it a bit safe and generally go for long term steady gains.


The one thing I read a lot of was that you need to have a strategy and try to stick to it, I also read a lot of pro DCA comments I'm sure there's people with better strats than mine, but here's what I've been doing.


Step one: DCA in and out with coins that generally trend up over time.


For this, I picked coins in the top 20 or so and invested small amounts into them, slightly increasing my amounts as the price went down. I'd sell off once I was able to make a profit of a few USD buy trading fractions of it as the price started to rise and rinse and repeat. Although the amounts I was getting was relatively small, I would put it to one side and I quickly saw this pot add up.


Step two: Invest profits into long term holding projects.


Whenever I'd catch a coin that I liked and wanted to hold long term going down in value  I would invest the profits from my step one into these. I'd do this every week and just forget about it, basically just DCA in and hold.


So far I have made steady but decent long term profits doing this. I don't make massive gains off anything or really chase moonshots and since the money going into these long term holdings are all raised from profits taken from step one I'm literally investing what I can afford to lose which is nothing out of my salary.

I'm interested to hear what you guys do too.",1635071061,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qephjr/my_crypto_investing_strategy_whats_yours/
82,CryptoCurrency,slushkan3an,What do you guys think of DAOs and the future of online communities?,"I believe, in my opinion, that Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) will not just revolutionize online communities but also create a whole new 'industry', especially when it comes to smart contracts and the subjective human, non-binary elements required to validate or invalidate a smart contract. 

Ok ... that was a mouthful. I am not really good at translating my thoughts to written words but I hope that this example helps: 

Let's look at Person A and Person B. 'A' wants to sell the house and 'B' wants to buy it. Usually, both 'A' and 'B' would have conditions and only if these conditions are met will the deal go through ... this is why we have 3rd party validators and ESCROW. 

'B' asks 'A' to do a some touch-ups and repairs before they buy the house. 'A' accepts but is worried that they do all this work/cost and then 'B' simply decides to pull out of the deal because they found a better one. 'A' asks 'B' to get a 3rd party validator (kind of like a judge that both parties will trust to be fair and objective) and place funds in an ESCROW. Once 'A' completes the repairs/touch-ups, the 3rd party will validate and release the funds in ESCROW from 'B' to 'A'. 

The argument for smart contracts is that they would be able to facilitate this whole thing in a much more efficient (automation), cost-effective (cheaper as there is no middle man fees) and trust-less manner. 

Let's say 'A' did the repairs and touch-ups as requested by 'B' however 'A' used the cheapest materials and labour ... basically just enough to meet the base requirements. Most 3rd party validators will not go way out of their way to validate the quality of the job (good/mediocre/bad) ... their incentive is to make the deal go through as fast as possible so that they get their fees. 

Ok ... so how is all of this related to smart contracts and DAOs?

Problem with smart contracts is that they are binary ... yes or no. Either something is validated or it is not. What about the subjective, human, non-binary elements like quality (which is more of a spectrum)? I think this is where DAOs come in. They would 'ride' on top of smart contracts and would help smart contracts validate non-binary things. For example, there could be a DAO (online community kind of like a subreddit) that specializes in homes/construction/interior design and its community of experts get to vote on subjective matters and get rewarded in crypto for their votes. This feeds the smart contract and the smart contract takes care of the rest. 

TLDR: I think that DAOs will be revolutionize the future of online communities and will be super essential for the adoption of smart contracts, especially for non-binary, subjective human perspectives. 

What do you guys think about this? Really interested to discuss this with you and learn from your inputs :)",1635070975,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qepgv6/what_do_you_guys_think_of_daos_and_the_future_of/

You wouldn't be able to deposit fiat from your bank to your crypto wallet or favourite crypto exchange and visa versa, you wouldn't be able to exchange your crypto to fiat and hence cash out to your bank.

So I'm wondering what body or regulation set governs this, who sets and allows this market in the first place. If the powers that be decided to ban this crypto/fiat swap ability then the crypto markets would come crashing down?

This is largely to do with my lack of understanding how markets work and are made.

86,CryptoCurrency,Newmovement69,Here is why Mark Cuban loves NFT ticketing and is going to implement it for the Dallas Mavericks this season (Indepth post on NFT ticketing)," In March Mark Cuban said that the Dallas Mavericks will start with NFT ticketing the upcoming season. With the start of the NBA season, we are seeing the first signs of mass adoption of NFT tickets collectibles in the NBA. This week Miami Heat announced that every ticket holder will receive a limited edition NFT of the FTX arena, after the ticket is scanned. When a twitter user called out Mark Cuban that he is suprised Miami Heat beat the Dallas Mavericks to NFT tickets. Cuban responded with a couple of tweets suggestion NFTs for the first Dallas Mavericks home game.

**Benefits of NFT tickets include:**

**Collectible** \- Tickets become tradable digital collectibles (NFTs), with a variety of awesome possibilities for fans &amp; event organizers. (most adoption of NFT tickets is currently happening in this area))

**Increased profitability** \- Total control and insights over the primary &amp; secondary market. Take in the profit that would have gone to scalpers.

**Unrivalled data** \- Clear, verifiable data on ticket ownership, vastly improving marketing efforts.

**Pre - financing events** – using tickets as colleteral to finance events leveraging the benefits of DeFi and NFTs

**Cuban**

Cuban has said the Mavericks were trying to find a good option for turning our tickets into NFTs. He is interested in increasing the revenue from ticket sales and maximizing the experience for fan using NFTs. The possibillity to ask royalties on NFT tickets is a great feature to increase revenue from ticket sales by getting a royality on secondary market sales. Cuban noticed season ticketholders will sell their tickets for a few high demand to pay for their wholse season ticket package. With a royality fee on NFT tickets sold on secondary market sales, the Mavericks will profit aswell from secondary market sales. 

**Adoptiong is already happening** 

major ticketing companies like **Ticketmaster and Seatgeek** are actively working on implementing NFT ticketing. Ticketmaster recently launched a FAQ for its NFT ticket marketplace. Seatgeek hired a blockchain executive as VP of engineering and Seatgeek plans to roll out NFT ticketing for the NFL and NBA. 

Which projects are working on NFT ticketing?

**GET protocol – 50m usd (+- rank 600 coingecko)**

**GET protocol** has been working on blockchian ticketing since 2016 and had its ICO in 2017. GET protocol offers existing and new ticketing companies tools to easily implement NFT ticketing. GET protocol has recently crossed the **1 million NFT tickets sold** mark. **9 ticketing companies** are using GET protocols NFT ticketing solution so far. The recently announced YourTicketProvider, which sells 2 million tickets annually. What I really like is that all tickets can be tracked on NFT ticket explorer.

Furthermore, the tokenomics of GET protocol create value for tokenholders. Ticketing companies that use GET protocol for NFT ticketing need to buy GET from the openmarket. The GET tokens that paid for usage of the protocol get transferred to the DAO. Tokenholders decide what happens with the funds of the DAO (burn the token, marketing etc). This proces is currently done manually. Automated on-chain tokenomics is currently in the last test phasing and will likely be announced at the end of the month. A technical overview of the flow of tokens used as fuel for the GET protocol can be read from the link below.

I am not aware of any other crypto projects with an own token that focus on NFT ticketing and have significant adoption. There are some projects without a token focus on NFT tickeing, like YellowHeart and NFT.kreds

The beauty of it is that it negates the risk of the market because it spreads the investment out over time.  


So the reverse DCA. For example, you have decided that you want to start profit taking and sell some of your BTC. So you think about when you want to sell and how much of it. So you sell some of your BTC at $65K. But then the BTC continues to rise to $70K so you sell another fraction there.   


The maths: 2 BTC at $65K is $130K.  
One BTC at $70K and one at $65K is $135K.

32,CryptoCurrency,kwadoss,Open Source medical research without intellectual property : launch Etica Protocol,"Since 2018 I've been working on the creation of a *Protocol for* ***Open Source Medical research without intellectual property*** *aka the* **Etica Protocol**. [https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org/)

As Victor Hugo puts it so well:  ***""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""***

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

**Brief presentation:**

Etica aims to promote ***open source medical research without intellectual property***. It incentivizes ***publication of research oriented papers*** (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (*ETI*). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the *curation rewards (for voters)* and *editor rewards (for creators of proposals)*.

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a *curation\_reward* as well as an *editor\_reward* will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit *Proposals* in order to get a part of the *editor\_reward*  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for ***bosoms***). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for ***3 weeks.*** *After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.*

The protocol is designed in such a way that **only about 72% of proposals will be accepted**. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to **improve the quality of their papers** to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

*The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).*

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

***The whitepaper:***

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe **smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper**  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

Reddit [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/):

I recently got ownership of [r/etica](https://www.reddit.com/r/etica/) and this is where I plan to organise the emerging community. If you are interested in this project make sure you join [r/etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica/).

Etica is all about open source and **creating a community based project** **with nobody having specific privileges**.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed ***it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1***.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to **launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community**
2. There will be **no premine**
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka **I won't have any privilege nor anybody else**
4. It is completely **open source**
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched **on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)**
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. **Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)**
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas

37,CryptoCurrency,Randrufer,"Shiba Inu makes me hate myself, Crypto and others who actually bought it. And I don't like it","I did the correct thing! I diversified into projects that have strong fundamentals like SOL and LINK and MATIC. The biggest chunk of my shit consists of ""Blue Chips"" like Bitcoin and ETH. I have some obscure coins like ADA, BNB and NANO just in case. 

WHAT I DON'T HAVE, BECAUSE DADDY TOLD ME NOT TO BUY IT, IS AN UTTER AND COMPLETE SHITCOIN LIKE SHIBA INU.

And I felt very smart. Shitcoin. No usecase. Kept alive by sheer hype and the occasional Elon Musk Post. The higher it went, the SMARTER I felt because surely it would come down aaaaaaaany second now.

I wanted to throw 100 Dollar Lottery Money into it at the very beginning.  I didn't. Sex isn't fun anymore.  Food has lost its taste. I can SENSE the parallel universe where I quit my job by deliberately giving me diarrhea and shit into my colleagues desk. That old hag.

If I had made a different decision some months ago, I'd be in that other train. But I'm in THIS train.

And that's why I started to hate everything.  I'm grumpy. But I still won't buy Shiba Inu. It will come down at some point.  But if it doesn't,  and becomes THE world currency, I hope my other crypto will be worth enough for the rope I need to buy for sexual asphyxiation.

I'm also relatively new to this cryptocurrency subreddit but really love the community so far. Hence I bought this premium to support this community. I need some advice on the stuff I am buying.

The majority of them are from people's recommendations from this Reddit. Overall, I am up about 7%. It is not that much but it is a good start. Here is the list of my holdings (please do not scold me):

|CRO|40%|
|:-|:-|
|ETH|22.2%|
|BTC|13.4%|
|ADA|6.1%|
|NANO|5.7%|
|MATIC|5%|
|ALGO|4.8%|
|VET|1.6%|
|ZIL|1%|
|DOT|0.1%|

The majority of my funds are in CRO because I applied for a card from them and I am using all the cashback to grab another token regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any mistakes that I have made so far and additionally, are there any other coins you guys recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate all the help from you guys! Thanks in advance! Please do not be mean to me as I am really new to this :) Hopefully, this would also serve as a post to guide other investors who are as confused as I am.

43,CryptoCurrency,Nuewim,"You can tell people about your crypto investments, but first move to better neighbourhood.","There were few stories about people being killed because they told their friends and neighbours about their crypto profits. Problem is that most of them lived in very bad neighbourhoods. With all my compassion for victims I can't imagine how dumb and irresponsible you need to be to tell poor and potentialy dangerous people you have a lot of  money and park sport car in slums. Informations like that move like lightening in bad neighbourhoods. In few days everyone will know it, drug addicts, homeless people, gangs, murderers, thiefs etc. Everyone can imagine  how it will end.


I am poor, I would never tell in my neighbourhood if I would have life changing money. I would just move out  to better neighbourhood and never come back.  I am one of them cause I am poor, if I would be rich all my neighbours and friends would hate me. I am already a freak cause I study at university. Everyone who is different in places like this, so want to have better life earn more money, be educated either move out quietly someday or lose everything, cause they told it to wrong person.


If you want to ""show off"" your wealth, so buy expensive things like iphone, brand clothes etc. better to move to normal neighbourhood, where having 2k$ phone is not death sentence. If you want to have mansion and lambo then move to rich neighbourhood, where people will be rich like you, and they will not want to steal your money and things. Some people think it is wrong, but you can't save the world alone and definietely you will never do anything good if you will die.

There is nothing wrong with being rich and showing it, but do it in secured place. You don't need to act poor your whole life. There are a lot of rich people, many of them hundreds times richer than you ever be. Are they in danger? Of course no, cause they do not spend their time in worst districts, where they would be robbed or killed. Humans are envious and greedy creatures, they like to spend time with people simmilar to them. Everyone better or worse is either envied or despised.

If you don't have money to move to better neighbourhood, then just shut up, if you don't want problems. If you have just move out, before you will start buying any better things.",1635068072,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeouu0/you_can_tell_people_about_your_crypto_investments/
44,CryptoCurrency,Socialinfluencing,Do not underestimate moons,"I think it's safe to say we're transitioning from to a time in human history where we're becoming more dependent on large corporations or chains for things like food, essentials and other everyday uses. Moons may not be the only form of reward for contributions on reddit or even the wider internet.  


But here's the kick, it's happening now. There is gonna be a massive wave of job losses in the way of retail, fast food and transportation. And due to covid, many professions are being altered in a permanent way. For example, therapists will eventually be able to work entirely from home.

The point is, whether good or bad, society is shifting. Whether people choose to be blind to it or not, it's definitely happening. Moons are not only the most popular social media contribution reward, it is also powered by one of the most visited or engaged subreddits on the entire reddit. Do not overlook or underestimate this. I know this is pure speculation, but I think the future economy will be much more home based than people realize.  


I feel it in my gut that moons are eventually going to be looked back at as either a missed opportunity or a fond memory, especially for those of us that are here now.

For example, if you make a robbery, it's not like you can point the gun to the cashier, ask for money and then say ""by the way this is not a robbery"". It doesn't work like that.

53,CryptoCurrency,Whiskeywonder,One of the last posts Satoshi was expressing if it was possible he would have some kind of mechanism where supply expanded and contracted like a decentralized Federal Reserve. That us now real using Ampleforth and Chainlink.,"The devs are real money nerds. Brian Amstrong is personally a VC investor. One of the main developers went to college with Brian and they together created the first Android Bitcoin wallet. He then went off to work for Google on AI and has recently moved back into the crypto space. 

So Ampleforth is imo the best ‘stable coin’ there is. What makes it completely different is it’s not pegged to dollars or any fiat and isn’t backed by other cryptos or assets. Think of it as simply a Bitcoin that has an elastic supply which is always in flux to target a dollar price. When I say dollar it’s actually a CPI dollar in 2019 so actually it presently targets around $2.05. This makes it perfect money as it will keep ahead of inflation and if there was a currency collapse it would simply readjust. So in time an Ampl dollar will be worth more like a few bucks. 

It’s chain agnostic and can run across any chain. It’s completely decentralized now. Name a better way to store your wealth long term. 

The big innovation is Ampl is about to be composable so a stable version of Ampl will be minted and can be used anywhere from defi to exchanges.",1635067116,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeoo4c/one_of_the_last_posts_satoshi_was_expressing_if/

After the 1st months payout you will have a total of =

5,037.50

In the second months payout, the 37.50 you earned the first time around, will net you even more interest = 37.78 and your total will be 5,075.28

Third month = 38.06 and your total will now be 5,113.34

There are blockchain bulls who argue that the power used for mining is by utilizing unused power or from renewable power. There's El Salvador using volcanoes for mining when the same electricity could be used for something less taxing like proof of stake and household use. 

There is excess GPUs out there, ready to be dumped on the market when ETH goes fully proof of stake. There is carbon footprint for every excess GPU that was made and don't forget about ASIC miners.

You don't need big warehouses and excess power for proof of stake. So these warehouses that were constructed for this purpose contributed to the carbon footprint.

All the excess accessories like pcie risers, PSUs, motherboards, ethernet cables or wifi does contribute to the overall carbon footprint. This will seem petty to a lot of people, by you just need 1 PC running a single or multiple virtual machines to mine any coin that you like with proof of stake and people with existing hardware can do so.

These miners who aren't voting on ETH moving completely proof of stake are no different from self absorbed politicians who just like the world burn.

With all the forest fires, floods and climate change around Canada, Brazil, Germany, India and parts of Africa, etc. I think more people should talk about global warming and how block chain is making it worse.

26,CryptoCurrency,chedebarna,Taking a loan to buy crypto may be OK,"Many people will freak out, but I think this is becoming a more popular opinion as figures like Michael Saylor insist on it and spread it.

It is OK to take a bank loan to buy crypto. Under the right circumstances.

First and foremost, as a conditio sine quae non, the loan needs to be repayable even if you lose 100% of the investment. This is akin to the trading advice of not overleveraging. If you have to go without food to pay back your monthly installment, you did it wrong.

I think it's common sense, but we all know about that, so I felt I had to spell it out.

Personally, I took a personal loan that takes less than 10% of my monthly income to pay back. I could have borrowed more, but I just didn't want to. The payback period is 96 months.

This for me is the equivalent of DCAing that amount of less than 10% of my income every month for 8 years, which I think is a treshold used by many people who DCA.

I just used the loan to accelerate this and be able to do a lump sum investment instead to benefit from higher returns from the earlier investment.

The price I pay for that is the loan interest, which at the current rates, compared against the upside of crypto, made it a no brainer.

Now, about what to do once you've accumulated enough profits to pay the loan back in one go and get rid of it... Do not.

Your debt in fiat depreciates every day. And you won't get any discount for paying it off earlier. As a matter of fact, you will usually be penalized.

For example, I am in year 2 of my 8-year loan. I could already pay everything back, principal and interests, with my crypto profits, and be done with that... But early payment incurs a 1% penalty.

Ridiculous, I know. Welcome to modern ""banking""!

Also, why would I want to pay now, when we all know that 1 dollar today is worth easily 1.5 dollars of 2028? Think about the things you could buy with 1000 bucks 8 years ago, and the milleage you get today. And it's just getting worse.

So no, you want to drag ever-depreciating fiat loans for as long as possible in fact -- while accumulating ever-appreciating (at least for the next 10-15 years) crypto.

Now, a similar reasoning works for the previous question that led me to the conclusion that borrowing was the way.

Why DCA in small sums, when you know that in the long run the trend goes up? You want to be a bit careful about the specific moment you throw in the lump sum of course. Try to find a dip. But even if you bought at the peak, if you give it enough time, it's likely that eventually you get a higher return than just DCAing.

Finally, the bit I think will be most controversial, because thisnis Reddit and we're here to play:

If you're young, asset-less, and have a 4 or 5 figure sum to invest (for instance by borrowing it), ignore the ""you should diversify"" crew.

If you have concluded (correctly) that crypto is a good investment that outperforms any other known asset class, why malinvest on purpose? That's not being cautious, but being incompetent.

Diversifying into low or even negative yield assets sounds like the type of eccentricity millionaires can afford, not young working people with no assets who are trying to generate and protect generational wealth starting from 4 or 5 figures.",1635061573,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qenjid/taking_a_loan_to_buy_crypto_may_be_ok/
28,CryptoCurrency,Drstrangelove2014,Cryptocurrencies Are Proof Our Beliefs Shape the World 🌍," More precisely, **Cryptocurrencies** are **proof that humanity's relationship with money is similar to religion.**

To prove a religion exists, I simply ask the following questions:

* Does the religion have a leader?
* Does the religion have followers?
* Does the religion have beliefs?
* Does the religion have rituals?
* Does the religion have places of worship?

When you put it like this, it is easy to show how basic principles of Bitcoin line up with these five factors.

This is how cryptocurrencies work:

* Bitcoins have no individual as a **leader**. However, a leader does not have to be necessarily an individual, but a function. In this case, the function of ""leader"" is filled by Bitcoin's algorithm, which acts as the ruler that governs the entire currency and network. The result: a robotic leader.
* Following Bitcoin are **miners and holders**. These people actively participate in the religion of Bitcoin and ascribe to the belief that it is a universal currency.
* Bitcoin has core **beliefs**. The main one is that it is a global currency, can't be controlled and is a payment system that is superior to all others.
* Bitcoin has **rituals**. Sending a transaction is a ritual, as is storing your Bitcoins somewhere. Keeping your wallet safe is a ritual. Mining is a ritual.
* Bitcoin has **a place of worship**, which is the exchanges. Exchanges act as a point of contact for people to communicate, trade, and engage with the religion of Bitcoin.

Note that the same thing is true for any other cryptocurrency. It is also the same structure in nations and

In fact, if you have any cryptocurrencies, you are actively participating in a social structure that has a one-to-one correspondence to a religion.

The **most interesting part** about all this?

* *We don't need to convince the world that Bitcoin is a good idea.*
* *We don't need to convert every person in the world to our way of thinking.*
* *We don't need to eliminate cash, or enslave humanity, or fill people with hate and set them against each other.*

Cryptocurrencies are proof that you can have a universal currency without any centralized body controlling it.

***And that's fucking beautiful.***

It's a fascinating example of both the power of groupthink/bandwagoning and how we can intentionally change our culture by creating rituals.

You can reprogram your own mind by simply changing your patterns and creating new ones.

The secret to controlling people is simple: control the flow of information. In this regard, we're winning, badly.

More and more people are becoming financially independent. They're moving away from the herd and constructing their own ideology by taking in information from a variety of sources.

We're winning because we're thinking for ourselves.

34,CryptoCurrency,RefugeeDutch_Syrian,CoinMarketCap got hacked!," 3.1 million email addresses linked to CoinMarketCap accounts were reportedly being traded on hacking forums, according to Have I Been Pwned. 

&amp;#x200B;

CoinMarketCap, a price-tracking website for cryptocurrencies, has reportedly fallen victim to a hack that leaked 3.1 million (3,117,548) user email addresses. 

The information came into light after the hacked email addresses were found to be traded and sold online on various hacking forums, and [revealed](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#CoinMarketCap) by Have I Been Pwned, a website dedicated to tracking hacks and compromised online accounts.

CoinMarketCap, confirmed that the list of leaked user accounts matched its userbase:

 **“CoinMarketCap has become aware that batches of data have shown up online purporting to be a list of user accounts. While the data lists we have seen are only email addresses, we have found a correlation with our subscriber base.”** 

 

While confirming the correlation of the 3.1 million (3,117,548) user email addresses with its userbase on Oct. 12, the company has assured that the hackers did not gain access to any of the account passwords. “We have not found any evidence of a data leak from our own servers — we are actively investigating this issue and will update our subscribers as soon as we have any new information,” CoinMarketCap spokesperson said.

Despite the confirmation, CoinMarketCap has yet to identify the exact cause of the hack. Responding to Cointelegraph's request for comment, CoinMarketCap [said](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/good-security-habits):

&gt;**""As no passwords are included in the data we have seen, we believe that it is most likely sourced from another platform where users may have reused passwords across multiple sites.""**

38,CryptoCurrency,RefugeeDutch_Syrian,Texas pension fund makes history and purchases bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH),"The Houston Firefighters Relief and Retirement Fund, a US pension fund with some $5.5 billion under management, has announced that they have recently invested in both bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). This makes the fund one of the first pension funds in the world to dare to invest in cryptocurrencies.

The pension fund is said to have invested a total of about $25 million. The fund's chief investment officer, Ajit Singh, thought the choice to invest in these cryptocurrencies was a logical one, he said in an [interview with Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/houston-pension-buys-crypto-an-asset-we-could-not-ignore):

""I see this only as a tool to manage my risk. It has a positive expected return and it has a low correlation with other asset classes.""

Ajit Singh, however, strongly preferred a direct investment in bitcoin and ethereum over a possible investment in one of the new bitcoin futures ETFs. According to him, the risk associated with futures ETFs is too great.

""We didn't want synthetic exposure. That's why we decided to go straight to the token. Once more and more institutional adoption will take place, more and more changes will develop for supply and demand. Owning physical assets, actual tokens, will generate potential income for us in the future.""",1635060280,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qen9m5/texas_pension_fund_makes_history_and_purchases/

Remember to always have a plan. Don’t over leverage, take out high interest loans you can’t pay and FOMO into any project you don’t believe or can hold through a bear market. Most alts can crash up to 90%, check CMC and see how many of the top 100 alts are there from each cycle. 

Ask yourself : what is your goal? 

Consider tax implications. We are fortunate to now have CeFi/DeFi like Celsius and NEXO where we can earn yield and take loans at 1%. For loans at least you won’t be subject to taxes and can keep your collateral. This will be a big market in 2022.

I have participated in AmA’s, asked several questions to the CEO directly, and the answers were less than satisfactory. 

When a bunch if potential new investors shared some concerns about why Strongblocks even needs investors to buy the tokens to run the “nodes” instead of just doing it themselves and making all the money themselves, this was their CEO’s response : “I’ll answer this question with some questions of my own: What would be the fun in that? How would you get non-technical people involved in building out the future? Even simpler: Why would you have a party but not invite anyone?

They had to torture him to give out his private keys.

When the corpse was discovered, the 30-year-old companion had first declared to the gendarmes to have been the target, with the student, of a homophobic attack, before admitting during his police custody to have participated in the assassination, with the two young people of 18 and 23 years old. The trio acknowledged their involvement, ""even if no one assumes having given the stab wounds,"" said the prosecutor. And the suspects eventually revealed that the twin brother and his wife helped them plan the crime.

TLDR:

There can be a perfect oracle network (perfect code, transparency, decentralization) but it is open to something called Sybil attack, where fake data can be profitable. This can be overcome but during that period of time, people will lose trust/traction in this network.

Chainlink solves this by using real-world reputation (banks, companies, etc) to make it a strong network initially and make it a high standard for the future so there's no scamming and therefore can build trust and gain traction from the start.

This post ends with that chainlink will consume all of the trust assurance industry, which I'm not totally sure. Basically everything that has to do with contracts and etc. //my opinion (and I'm not an expert by any means) is that while chainlink will be a big part of this, as it connects the real-world data to crypto world, there has been a lot of advancements since this original post which seems to be from 2019. I think it's more true that **crypto** will consume all trust assurance industry, and chainlink is one that cannot be missed in that world. I am very bullish chainlink and eth.

Even nfts and projects I see nfts barely scrape by on Solana, almost all real  nfts are built on the eth network or on their own. I think that Etheruem will continue to dominate the space for a minimum of the next decade and tbh I don’t see anything out right now over taking it ever.

88,CryptoCurrency,piggleii,"What would be considered a 10x (or whatever ""x"")?","I sometimes see posters on r/cc saying they 5x'd or 10x'd they're investment. But what exactly is a 5x or a 10x. Seems like a simple question at first, but let me dive deeper here.

Say you started DCA'ing a coin when it was $1. And you continued DCA'ing all the way up to $10. So you've obviously 10x'd your earlier DCA's but your cost average is obviously higher given you continued DCA'ing all the way up.

So in the situation above, could you say proudly that you've 10x'd your investment (or at a portion of it), or is that declaration only reserved for those who dumped a lump sump into a coin never to invest in it again, and/or for those who stopped DCA'ing at some stage, thereby easily determining that they 10x'd their total investment?",1635057281,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qemm7r/what_would_be_considered_a_10x_or_whatever_x/

""Sell (5%, 25%, other) of coins held.""

I have numerous amounts invested in 40 coins. I'd like to capture my initial investment, but am wondering if I should capture way more? 

My current strategy (based on what I'm forecasting to at LEAST hit) is to sell off 15% of coins owned. That will give me my initial investment + 25% profit of initial investment and still holding coins for whatever happens next.


X = Amount of coins to sell
Y = Initial investment
Z = Initial investment profit
A = Coin ticker
B = Amount of coins held

AB(.15) = X

X(40) = Y

Y(.15) = Z

$0.14 price * 250,000,000 total supply = $35 million current market cap

I think MOONs will be at least a top 100 coin, based off of being one of the first social coins on a major social platform like Reddit. The #100 coin on Coingecko right now has about a $1 billion market cap. 

$1 billion / $35 million = ~28x of room to grow

$0.14 * 28 = $3.92

So: I think MOONs will break $1, and then much more, based of some pretty conservative estimates IMO. That's the crypto market right now; in a few years, I would think a top 100 coin will be more than $1 billion, and it's not unreasonable to think MOONs could reach $10, which would only be about ~$2.5 billion, which are a dime a dozen even now.",1635056212,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qemdwi/why_i_think_moons_can_reach_10_based_off_of_its/

5,CryptoCurrency,9inchChaceOF,Lessons learned on NOT listening to this sub and NOT taking profits Feat. Shib,"(Disclaimer: I know very well that shib and related coins are closer to dog shit than a token that could be considered anything even slightly useful, but im just here to make money)

The story:

Having a strong feeling that the bull run was no where close to being over I was quite sure Shib would have a new ATH in not too long of time. (Spoiler: it did)

I bought Shib after it bottomed out after the May pump at around .000006. It practically sat stagnant since then. After quite a few months of this, I'd be lying if I wasn't considering getting this bullShib off my hands. But, despite the constant hate and advice to sell on this sub, and the spirit of Satoshit, I held on.

Fast forward about 5 months later 

Pumptober hits and Shib gets a new support at .000025 - 28 range. From .000006 to . 000028! 

I log back on to my favorite subreddit, and shib is in nearly every post. 
""Well that's cool, ima click on one"", I say.
Result: dirty no-Shibers advising us to sell asap, get out of the pump, etc. 

Reddit is effective. I started to have paper hands, the spirit of Satoshi was slowly being replaced by the spirit of The Average Redittor, and I considered selling for a simple and lowly 4x. Still better than stocks of course, but not good enough for Satoshi or myself. I was scared. I was alone. I was becoming a Redditor.

BUT 

momma didn't raise no bitch. I grabbed my ballsack and held for dear life. 

Fast forward to today. Shib new ATH at .00003652, support strong at .000028, holding now at around .000036 with steady upward trend as I type.

Now sitting with over 6x on this shitcoin everyone advised me to sell a thousand times. 

Will I sell now?

No. 

Will I regret it?

Probably, but only after shib gets a few more ATHs

Will I listen to redditors?

No.

Should you even listen to this post, since I myself am a redditor? 

No, I could be totally lying about all of this.

28,CryptoCurrency,callumjones,Don’t assume KuCoin going down is fraudulent activity.,"After reading the borderline conspiracy theory on KuCoin going down I felt it was worth sharing my perspective as an engineer who has built businesses on AWS and that we should not always assume the worst intent. It’a typically a company that is going through growing pains. I’m not saying this is good, KuCoin should be meeting demand if they want to avoid hurting customers, but they are not trying to commit fraud.

What is really happening here is KuCoin is likely not able to meet demand. A 504 or Gateway Timeout is just a standard response mechanism from backend services when they are overloaded with requests e.g. they have more demand than their system can handle. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/504. We call these gateways or proxies because in the early days web servers would proxy the backend requests to scripts that would execute the request.

Now why can’t they handle the scale? It typically comes back to a weak point in the system: they don’t have auto scaling for their web servers (AWS will happily let you launch as many servers as you want, they want to make money) or their database instance isn’t sized correctly (you can’t just add more RAM to a database without some downtime).

The post proposes that geo load balancing can solve this. Sadly it cannot unless you are literally Amazon, Facebook or Google. Databases are unfortunately still very hard to run in multiple regions without giving up some characteristics that require them to replicate the data consistently amongst each other. So because of this most companies decide to operate out of one region (you would be surprised how many big tech companies do this) because one region going down rarely happens. So for that reason you just end up putting all your servers in one spot.

Finally there no AWS sales rep blocking companies from scaling out. There are systems limits by default but you can get customer support to remove this in a matter of minutes.

86,CryptoCurrency,WaffleOverlord,InfinitX is a rug pull (with proof you can verify yourselves),"If you've been thinking of FOMOing into INX, don't.  The devs (dev??) are the same as InfinitUP, which flatlined a little over a week ago from a rug pull.  If you take a look at the InfinitX CoinGecko listing, and then look up the Smart Contract listed there on BscScan, the marketing fee wallet is the same wallet as the one in the InfinitUP code.

Let's verify this!

Go to the BscScan page for both the InfinitX CG listing (0x1f5d9ffafa57604ae2a43cebadecc175df2f069e) and the InfinitUP CG listing (0xc6f26e6df5f44c0ccd939581987c09b866cdbd1a), and then checking the Smart Contracts for both, which are both listed previously, and available on both CG and CMC.  Go to the Contract address for each one, (INX =0x1F5d9fFAFa57604Ae2A43cebAdEcC175DF2F069e , IUP = 0xc6f26e6df5f44C0Ccd939581987C09b866cDBd1A ).

Now we check the Contract source code.  

Scroll down to where that little green checkbox is, next to the word Contract.  That green checkbox means that the source code shown is verified by BscScan to be the same code in the actual contract.  Now, we use Ctrl+F to find ""marketingFeeReceiver"", and we go to the second result.  Do this for both INX and IUP.  Now compare the marketingFeeReceiver addresses, and copy+paste it (they're the same) into the BscScan search bar.  Look at the drop down menu showing what kind of tokens the wallet is holding.  This wallet has both IUP and INX!!

But wait, there's more!

If we look at the websites for both of these coins, and then scroll down to the Road Map, the Road Maps are virtually identical, with the exception of BNB being changed to XRP.  The dev even misspelled the word ""celebrities"" as ""celibrities"" in both websites. 

I'd very much like to be wrong about this, but the information is all publicly available, due to the Smart Contracts being open source.  I created a burner Discord account and joined the INX Discord server, and pointed all of this out, and the dev MoonP resorted to throwing insults and calling me poor.  At one point, they even said something along the lines of ""I'm a dev and that means I know better than you"", which solidifies my opinion that this is a rug pull.  I made a second burner Discord account, and joined the server, acting as a concerned investor, and was able to get MoonP to admit that the contract addresses I had provided earlier (on the first burner) were correct, from the pinned messages in that Discord server. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I have to say this, but I would like to stress that XRP and BNB have nothing to do with this aside from the fact that they were pegged to each coin on creation.  Also, this is not financial advice. Do your own research and verify yourself that the information I've provided is accurate.  I refrained from posting links or screenshots, but I will provide them if asked.  Or you can join the Discord server yourself (the link is on InfinitX's CG listing) and scroll up to about 7:20-7:30PM PST or so for the day of October 23 2021.",1635048629,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qekmyj/infinitx_is_a_rug_pull_with_proof_you_can_verify/

3. They believe this because they believe that inflation is a sin.
4. Inflation is the debasement and devaluation of one's currency.
5. And by doing so, the government is essentially stealing a small portion of their own citizens' money every year.
6. Breaking the eighth commandment, ""You shall not steal.""
7. Governments can print any amount of money at any time, devaluing their own people's money at any rate they choose.

As a Christian, if you believe this case to be true, then it is probably a good idea to get involved in the cryptocurrency space.

24,CryptoCurrency,prajwalwillrule,I'm here to warn you about Leveraged Futures Trading. DAY TRADING warnings are nothing when compared to this !,"Story time,

Last snapshot I decided to fuel my trading addiction by doing a 1 month hodling+staking vs day/swing trading experiment. I started with 100$ because I'm broke af. 

Spent a few days turning that to about 130$

Then I finally thought to check out this Futures trading. I didn't know shit about fuck, so a quick YouTube tutorial and I put in the 30$ I made into it. Shiba was on fire back then and just starting to drop from ATH. 

With 10x Shiba Shorting, and some BTC, ALGO longs, I turned my 30$ to about 250$ in a week! That's about 8 times my investment. 

I came on this sub to brag and got a shitload of warning. The good part was I hadn't been liquidated in that 1 week.

My greed got the best of me and I started trading with bigger amounts(from 250$) and with 20x and 25x
I watched my profits in the position at 100s of $ and like a dumbass I went to sleep thinking I'll be a millionaire in a week this way.

Fast forward to next morning, I opened my eyes and saw 4 messages from Binance. They said my positions had been liquidated 😂

I was back to 15$ now. I made 8x in a week, and lost it in a night. 

I'm not warning you guys because I lost money overnight. I warn you because I got addicted so bad, I put in more money and lost more of it. 

Once you get a taste of how quickly you can make money  with high risks, it's hard to go back. This has turned me into a damn gambler, moving me from 15min charts straight to 3 min and 1 min charts.

**Tips for anyone looking into futures trading**

1. **DON'T**

Well, if you still wanna do it,

1. Take profits on time. 

2. Don't get greedy and increase your leverage too much. The ""volatility"" of crypto goes both ways, up and down. So don't get greedy and lose your money. 

3. Most coins follow BTC, keep a close eye on it. 

Having said that, I'm going back to my rabbit hole and try to get back my initial investment before quitting futures(no I'll seriously give up once I get my money back. I swear on Shiba coin)

I'll give you a life tip which you can tell the entire world, and the world will become a better place.

DCA, Stake, and HODL.

One thing I have come to realized is that - if you are to fall in the rabbit hole the “right way”, meaning, do your own research about different coins/chains, it is more natural and makes more sense to be a maxis than to be a multi-chain. If you really do your own research, it takes a lot of time because not only do you need to read and understand the white paper, you also need to deeply immerse yourself in the community to have a better understanding of how the community works, read different posts/books and listens to hours of podcasts to understand the context of why the chain is created, what problems the chain is trying to solve etc… Once you finished your research, it is highly likely to be a maxis in the coin you just researched. I genuinely think that those who say they are a “multi-chain” supporter has to have a very macro pov (hence, not that technical and more financially focused) and doesn’t do a deep enough research in any chains.",1635045130,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qejr64/unpopular_opinion_it_is_easier_and_makes_more/

First post here, and I'll just say I know enough about crypto to be dangerous to my bank account and why it exists as a whole.

Outside of that, I'm basically clueless.

Right now I want to start transitioning from my ""trading only"" approach and actually holding my crypto myself and not on an exchange.

First of all, how would I do that and how do I not get scammed in the process?

Second, if I'm looking for quality news and discussion on crypto outside of this sub, where can I find it?

Third, where can I educate myself on crypto as a whole and its benefits to the world? I know YouTube is a good source of info, but I never know when I'm walking into a minefield with mixed truths and misleading statements. 

I'm guessing BTC is the big staple that everyone wants you to hodl, and ETH is probably a close second since they're the heavy hitters.

I do plan on continuing my trading on the side and participating in some Moon shots... but I feel that crypto I hold on my own and long term will be better for me than any short term gains that are held in an exchange.

33,CryptoCurrency,Many_Scratch2269,"The US Dollar has to devaluate significantly in order for the US to pay off its debt. If you don't invest in Crypto soon, you will regret it later.","The US debt currently sits at more than 28 Trillion dollars. This is 140% of the US GDP. There is absolutely no way the US can pay this much debt off without devaluating the dollar. The US has already printed more than 50% of its dollar supply in the last 2 years alone. We are already seeing supply shocks happening and inflation rising.

It won't be stopping anytime soon either. The US keeps touching its debt ceiling faster and faster and the debt is rising exponentially. 

https://preview.redd.it/o0bl8z7u8bv71.jpg?width=910&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9110b2bca502cfdb3d2ddc7f37801609f4f6f2

Just in case you forgot earlier, in order to pay this debt, the US will have to devaluate the dollar significantly. Guess what happens when the US dollar devaluate? Other countries will also follow. 

**Currencies pegged with the US dollar**: Aruban florin, Bahamian dollar, Bahraini Dinar, Barbadian dollar, Belize dollar, Bermudian dollar, Cayman Islands dollar, Cuban convertible peso, Djiboutian franc, East Caribbean dollar, East Timor centavo coin, Eritrean Nakfa, Hong Kong dollar, Jordanian dinar, Lebanese pound, Netherlands Antillean guilder, Omani rial, Panamian balboa, Qatari riyal, Saudi riyal, United Arab Emirates dirham, Venezuelan bolivar.

The takeaway from this is that Cryptocurrencies are going to be extremely valuable in the future. You probably already know this, but Crypto is going to be more valuable than what you currently think because not only is there significant inflation already, it is only going to get worse as countries have to pay off their debt. 

The US isn't alone in their debt crisis however. Almost every country has to inflate away their debt. The inflation we are seeing currently is nothing considering what might come in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

[\*significantly more as of Q4 21](https://preview.redd.it/hbjxq4ahbbv71.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c57542af8aacf7ada28e9cb35a5273601f70875)

How do you think the world is going to pay all this debt off? Short answer, it can't. Inflation is going to be huge. Crypto is currently the best way to avoid inflation. Crypto literally has deflationary currencies right now while some countries are facing severe inflation. Crypto is one of your only bets to survive the coming inflation. The inflation we are seeing currently is severely underestimated as the CPI doesn't count the housing market and other assets that have ballooned in the last 2 years alone.

TLDR: Countries are going to have to inflate their currencies to pay off their debt (especially after the pandemic, we are already seeing a huge inflation rise) and one of the only ways you can avoid inflation and take advantage of the situation is to invest in Crypto. Invest while you can because inflation will ruin your financial condition in the future if you keep holding your wealth in fiat.",1635044577,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qejlw6/the_us_dollar_has_to_devaluate_significantly_in/

They aren't taxable. You're Soda in you're fridge is property as it was paid for during a Voluntary transaction but it's not taxed everywhere except some places. But Cryptocurrency has Property taxes. Why? Well there's no Valid reason as to why Except it's free money for the government to impose taxes on because they're greedy.  


  
I Hate the idea of NFT and Cryptocurrency taxes as they're not property of 1 nation. Let me put it this way. If I owed a House in Canada The US Wouldn't be able to tax me for owning a house in Canada. So it's pointless to tax someone's crypto when the currency exists on External servers in god only knows where. So if cryptocurrency can exist on any number of servers or hard disks anywhere and has to use an API or Internet connection to calculate prices then it's not anyone's to tax.  


Again relating back to the problem of it being a ""Property Tax"" If It's on a server in IDK let's say Russia... Then Why should the US Have any ability to tax me? Anyone got an answer to such a stupid question? No? Great.   


  
I'm not saying you should commit tax evasion but hey you lost your wallet in a boating accident. But Just pay your taxes and fight like hell to have this BS Tax Law thrown out the door. It's pointless and stupid. Remember if you're a Citizen of the US.... We the people are in control of the people we elect. Bureaucrats? No but with enough push they can be thrown out too.  


Fight like hell to have these Tax laws thrown out. They're profiting off of something that's hard to prove you own or that isn't in server that's inside a building located on the soil it's being taxed on.",1635039065,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qei643/crypto_and_nft_taxes_shouldnt_be_a_thing/
21,CryptoCurrency,amosrendao,Crypto tax software that allows you to project future scenarios to compare tax implications of various strategies,"It's nice to see so many robust softwares coming out of the last couple years to make handling the complexities of crypto taxes easier, but I'm still struggling to find a software that allows you to put in hypothetical sells in the future and compare tax implications of various dates, amounts, accounting methods (FIFO, LIFO, SPEC ID, etc).

I'm not presently completely clear on how exactly you land in various tax brackets when factoring in normal wages/STCGs/LTCGs, etc. So a huge bonus would also be to see that all pumped out for final comparisons while entering in variables for multiple strategies.  


I build an airtable over the last couple days that nearly accomplished this goal, but I'm starting to think airtable has some limitations that can't handle circular references around accounting for splitting a buy across multiple sells :(

Couple of weeks back, I understood that binance is centralised and hence, discouraged by the community.

What do you think about adopting BCH more than BTC ?
I just realised is an illusion.
You can’t totally exclude a part of society like companies, politics and banks from  money in a bliss of an eye.
Changing take quite relatively its own time.
Adopting now BCH in terms of payment and p2p electronic cash would be a nightmare.
A war against central banks instead of a slow transition (but steady) like bitcoin is doing.
It’s obvious that majority of people don’t get what an hardware wallet is or DeFi.
This is where institutions and banks are still taking profits, but with times BTC is doing a transition of power from centralised institutions towards individuals.
And this is all great and blissful.

I think that BCH will continue growing reflecting the power of his father-mother BTC in the future.

69,CryptoCurrency,SergeyKalinin,I would like to tell you about my Simplex registration story..,"1. Completely buggy image verification system. I sent I sent my passport in vain thirty times literally (it only to find out that instead of national - that is, my civil passport (is written on the website clearly: ""please attach the national identification document"") , it turns out that a foreign passport is required (!!) and this is indicated by support in a letter a week later! ...

In general, I wonder why require a foreign passport ... I'm not obliged to have one as a citizen of the Russian Federation. Is this something that should somehow hinder the crypto operations via Simplex? Okay, so be it, a week later I started loading my foreign passport ...

&amp;#x200B;

2. Every time I attach documents, the system writes that photos are blurry, glare detected - I actually tried to attach it 30 times, I took pictures from the 8th iPhone, from Samsung, from different angles, under different light conditions, I even asked another person to take a picture of these documents instead of me (I thought it was from maybe my hands are crooked), the result is the same - blurry! ... idiocy, the system simply does not accept documents and that's it. This identification is not really well tested and instead of simplifying the verification of documents, it's just torturing people who want to register !! Passports always contain glowing security features, and they will always be blurry and make glares!

&amp;#x200B;

3. By some miracle, after completing the ""attach pictures"" exercise, from the attempt number 31, having lost faith in humanity, and also receiving robotic replies in Simplex chat - I proceeded to the window, which stated that photos I have uploaded are on ""manual verification""... This window just hung for another week without any changes. After this week of ""manual verification"" I was simply asked to try again uploading pictures to the buggy system ... Dear Simplex, where is logic?  I even mailed them already by that moment all required documents in high quality - all the same, they send only formal replies and asking you to perform clearly according to the algorithm, like robots ... In a response to my letter, they just repeated me a link, to upload all photos to this moronic system as if I have just registered.

So what do you think? I opened that link and saw a window which stated that ""manual verification"" is being carried out and there were no forms for uploading a photo ... Then there were 2 more iterations of useless correspondence with robots and their formal replies in chat and by mail, in style ""we will fix it now"", ""everything will be ok"" ... and another week of my time has gone...

&amp;#x200B;

4. After some time I again managed to upload all the documents and froze for another week on ""manual verification"". Deja vu... I wrote to them about all this in their chat, they promised to speed it up. As a result, thank you, they ""speeded it up"" ... Another week has passed and I receive a new request:

1. Certificate of criminal record (it takes up to 30 days to receive this paper from the police!)

2. Extract from all bank accounts, where I spent how much and how muck i have earned for 3 months (is this really necessary to open a simple banking account??? What will Simplex do with all my McDonnalds spending checks?)

3. Am I a politically engaged person? (Oh Really? They haven't googled that I am the former president of Russian Federation after a month of registration??)

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, In total, it has already been already 5 weeks since I started my registration in Simplex ... In fact, the account has not yet been opened, I continue sending and sending all new documents ... My requests, to somehow speed up this process, are replied with formal robotic answers that are in fact don't help much.

By today, I have sent an the statement from Sberbank with all my income and spendings for 3 months. Now I am waiting for the readiness of a certificate of no criminal record from the police (I have never ever been asked such document in my life, Simplex is the first company that asked me this shit).

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to lose a month of your life, chat with robots and achieve nothing, then apply for registration in Simplex. I wouldn't recommend Simplex to anyone, it's a terrible service. It would be easier to open an account in the most ordinary bank!

&amp;#x200B;

PS. I will by all means get them to open an account. I need it, because without it, you cannot issue a COTI debit card. Up to now it is 1 month that has passed in vain. I will write on how things are developing!

I would like to wish to those who implemented such a ""convenient"" customer service to burn out in hell, I never thought that registration would have to spend so much time and effort!",1635036278,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qehetv/i_would_like_to_tell_you_about_my_simplex/

82,CryptoCurrency,diwalost,TLDR - What is VORTECS experiment and score?,"For those who don't have time to read the complete article, here is the TLDR

Here’s the basic premise. In partnership with data firm The TIE, Cointelegraph Markets Pro has developed the VORTECS Score, ""an algorithmic determination of how bullish or bearish current trading conditions are for a given crypto asset.""

The score is based on historical data, and it considers whole history of a coin or token looking for conditions like trading volume, recent price action, social sentiment, and even the volume of tweets about that asset, that are similar to those it observes right now.

If it finds similarities, it looks at what happened next. Did the asset go up or down? How consistent was that movement? How significant was the rise or fall?

1. Combining all of these data points, it creates the VORTECS™ Score,  
2. The higher the score, the more bullish the outlook — and the more confident the algorithm is and vice versa.
3. A neutral score of 50 means the algorithm sees no significant correlation between current conditions and past price performance.
4. A Buy 80, Sell 12 hours strategy means that the test ‘buys’ every asset that crosses the 80 score, which is considered strongly bullish. And then it ‘sells’ the asset again after precisely 12 hours.
5. Of course, this is not happening on an exchange — it’s happening on a spreadsheet because it is just a test of concept. 

Why you couldn’t do this

1. It takes someone two manage the portfolio 24*7 even without sleep.
2.  It doesn't take into account liquidity or order depth on any particular asset on any given exchange. 
3. exchange fees involved.

So why is this a valuable test at all?

A high VORTECS Score has a proven correlation to price appreciation. Not in every instance, not for every asset… but in general this ten-month trial has made a compelling case.",1635035826,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qehai6/tldr_what_is_vortecs_experiment_and_score/

when I look at this sub 70-80% of daily posts are shitpost and copied content, rest are shared articles with fortune tellers predicting moving of market and ~5% are actually good posts.

So lets say we didnt have moons in this sub, there wouldn't be that much shitposting or even any. But the question is, would that kill the sub or would it be quality over quantity? I wasnt here before moons so elders please step up and speak about how this sub was before. 
In this state sub is more quantity over quality but it keeps us interacted in some way and so called shitposting let people earn moons. For some People moons might even be a main source of income and that is why they are of great value, literally changing lifes! I agree there is a lot or rather too much copied content and it bothers me.  I would prefer more calm sub with a healty ratio of quality and comedy posts!

I don't know if possible but if this sub could be divided by tabs, one of the tabs would be designated for shitposts/comedy posts and another tab for helpful posts/guides etc. that would greatly help divide those two things in sub while keeping everything in the same sub with possibility to earn moons either for shitposts or quality posts!
This way we could achieve what people of this sub want, be able to avoid low quality/comedy content and only see content they want to see. 


This might be a hot take but I actually think moons improve this sub aside some downsides that come along! We could say we are still early with moons and for me community has to play role in shaping this sub! We need to speak up, and help keep this sub in best shape possible!

54,CryptoCurrency,amandamichelle90,Some of the best advice I ever heard - Stop mentally pricing coins by your own experience with it,"We all do it, our entry price or the price we spent the majority of our time holding it at, or the ATH we put mental emphasis on certain prices and to us it becomes “on sale” or “overpriced” just because we saw it higher or lower for a long time and got attached. 

Times like this we hear “don’t buy at all time high” which, by the way is only a thing until it goes higher and only really matters if you’re looking for a quick flip — kinda irrelevant to the long term idea. 

But as time goes on, you lose those emotional evaluations of the standard price, a little over a year ago we saw BTC hit 10k for the very last time and there were absolutely people who discouraged buying in at that price — today though you would be happy you did. *There’s also people who sell at times like these, hoping to buy back in on the dip and end up holding more coins, we don’t speak of it as frequently but it’s the same feeling as selling for a loss because people do often eventually buy back in at a higher price than they wanted to.*

TLDR: Get in when you get in, and stay in. Old floors become new ceilings so don’t get attached to random price points just because you lived with them a long time.",1635032074,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeg7tk/some_of_the_best_advice_i_ever_heard_stop/

Just remember that even making enough profit for a practical car, getting yourself out of any debt you may have or providing a better life for your family  are HUGE wins.

Anything less than being filthy rich is not a loss. Just because you didn’t turned your life around after being invested in crypto for 2 months does not mean it will never happen, i don’t think getting rich over night is healthy for you to be perfectly honest.

70,CryptoCurrency,Zantti,Is HYPE really the crucial thing that gets a cryptocurrency going?,"Is hype really the crucial thing in cryptocurrencies?

As stated above I truly believe that hype is important in this space but sometimes I get the impression that it is also the only thing that matters in all of this.

We’re all witnessing some great projects not being listed on exchanges while some “shit” projects are being listed.

Why?

They have no purpose, they don't have any project behind them, but they have something that some great projects don't have and that's hype.

Let’s be honest, many people finish ""DYOR"" within minutes. They google ""price prediction"" and are happy with the number they see, and since they can buy millions of coins for $50, they feel they will make a huge profit. They don’t understand tokenomics, they don’t understand market capital. In the long term they may fail, but in the short term it happens that they sometimes succeed.

I sincerely want everyone to make gains but I can’t hide that the success of some coins that serve no purpose frustrates me while some good projects with awesome hardworking team behind them fail.

Why does this matter? Because new people who enter this world do not understand a lot of things. They lose money and cryptocurrencies are in their heads ""a scam"".

But I DCA a little differently, and for 3 consecutive weeks, I've sabotaged myself with greed. 

**Here's how I do it.**

So today I was to buy ETH. Saturday is my day for ETH. And when I woke up, the price was somewhere around $3,975. I figure it's reasonable with price fluctuations throughout the day to set a limit buy for $3,950. But then the prices went up. Over 4k it goes and I adjust my limit to $4,000. 

But the price kept going up. $4,050, $4,100, and now nearly $4,150. If I just bought at whatever price this morning, I'd be up 4% already. But now I'm still holding my money because I don't want to buy high. 

Granted, I could've bought at the random non-round number, but the psychology of it wants me to get juuuuuust a little bit better of a price. 

So now I have a $4,000 buy order, and it will likely fill during a big fat dip as the knife falls.

- Are ecosystems like Cosmos, Polkadot, Cardano etc. more similar to tcp than browsers? 
   - if so, why can you view them on the internet and not have to use a specific application? Basically how does it all connect together and how do I ""use"" Atom or Polkadot for example?
- also how tf is monero not traceable? Can't they just see what was on your account and do the math? 
- if coins are built on specific blockchains, why aren't wallets and exchanges and dexs more transparent about what chains the coin you hold are on!?!

10,CryptoCurrency,FieldMarshallSimpson,Crypto currency and the Internet,"When the internet began it was largely misunderstood and not seen for its potential. There were problems with some of its regulations and laws were not in place to prevent or lessen its misuse. 

The infrastructure has been constantly upgraded over time and issues and limitations have been worked past.

""Experts"" also said it would fizzle and its a fad and it will die. The dotcom bubble crash of the early 2000s seemed to confirm this but long term it was proven otherwise.

A similar trajectory I've seen with crypto. Smart contracts, blockchain improvements and security improvement have seen it become more viable and more and more wide spread adoption. Governments are buying these tokens and looking to implement them. The global money transfer is too cumbersome in this day and age and takes too long. 

Interest from banks don't keep up with inflation and the normal working people don't benefit. Making crypto more understood and making people see a future in it would cause a widespread uptake.

So the reason for my post is this... how do you mitigate this final risk?  obviously she has access to the seed phrases.  she isn't confident enough to handle the wallet to exchange, sell order and then withdrawal to our fiat account. 


I said maybe in 5 or 10 years time the technology wouldn't require the withdrawal to fiat or use of exchanges but still... what if died next year?  that money is locked up.  you can't trust a stranger not to steal it when you ask for help.

However, I reckon most people want to sell all their portfolios this end of the year (trying to time the peak of this cycle) to buy back in the bear market. Of course you should do whatever you want with your money, but you never know if the peak of this cycle will be EOY, Q1 2021 or even later. You must consider all options since every market cycle is longer than the previous one. With institutions,companies and even countries in between, I do believe that this bull run will probably go to Q1/Q2 2022 and who knows, maybe even later. The thing is, if we peak in Q1/Q2 2022 (which is a possibility), those who sell in December will regret their decision.

Everything went ok, just like always, drinking and chatting, but at one point when mood was ""uplifting"" (shots and beer was hitting) we ended up talking about money.

Investing, stocks and all that was on the table. And of course ""Jake"" started to talk about crypto ""guys, its probably best what you can invest these days"". ""Jim"" followed same song and in a second i knew they were in this together. They started to talk how you dont need to invest thousands, only ten here ten there is enough to make you rich if you are patient. I told them i know something about crypto and i have been ""investing"" more than a year, and we started to go in details. Rest of the guys were hangin around bar so they didnt know what we were talking about, i bet they wouldnt even care.

And yes, boom, here it came. ""You should invest in Shiba, its best way to make a fortune"" and bla bla bla. They both told how they have invested few hundreds in Shiba and started to explain how massive gains it has made in the past, none on any crypto have made anything like that and how it will explode. I just listened and they kept going about how Shiba will be next year 0.1$ and in five years 2-5$. I couldnt hold my self and tried to explain thats impossible. I tried to explain what would it mean to market cap and how massive it should be to make those prices happen, but they wouldnt listen. They just kept repeating how Shib only needs to gain +2000% every month, like so far, and in the end it will be over 1$ with no problem. 

I am not gonna explain how i finally realizd i was only bangin my head on the concrete wall, all what i tried to explain even most simple way, it was just pointless. They kept repeating same thing like cult believers. Of course, we were bit drunk so first shouting and then fighting.

In contrast a memecoin with nothing happening is under the exact same price fluctuations as bitcoin - only buying/selling matters.

Is anyone able to confirm or deny that projects make no difference to the viability of a coin, and are purely for advertising purposes like news articles?

1. They think it's linear
2. They measure with the wrong things

People are claiming CPI is a terrible measure of inflation for a few reasons:

1. You're measuring plentiful goods
2. You're measuring what it means to subsist rather than get ahead in life

The true measure of inflation is how much assets have increased in price. Assets are what people should strive for and what QE keeps pushing farther and farther out of reach of those who don't have any.

Since we fired up the money printers in April 2020, both real estate and the stock market have gone up \~27%. Which very closely mirrors the increase in the money supply. That is the true cost of inflation.

By knowing current market cap we know how big our profits can be.  By calculating our dream price x number of all coins we can check if market cap will made our dreams ever possible to achieve. 

But there is one problem. It is just numbers. Reality often prove math doesn't work so well as it should. People and markets are unpredictable. 10 years ago Bitcoin having 1 trillion market cap was crazy idea. You would probably end in mental hospital for saying it. In XVI century no would have idea some tulips will be worth as much as a houses. In 2019 no one sane predicted doge can grow so much as it did. Human history if full of impossible things.


Not all existing  coins will possible to  sell. Actually bilions of $  in crypto  were lost forever. For example 21 millions  BTC is just base number. Already thousands of wallets were lost with combined tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of BTC. Satoshi Nakamoto alone have like 1 million BTC. His wallet is inactive for years, we don't even know if he is alive. A lot of other  coins are on lost wallets or destroyed hard discs, owners died etc. Access to them is lost, no one will ever sell them. 

And also a lot of projects burn coins to increase price and reduce number of coins. Market cap is not good measure for coins that have burns. And there are quite a few coins like that, and unlike most people say not only shitcoins burn coins. Best to examples are Ethereum and  BNB also Shiba. Calculating current number of coins with future price or market cap doesn't work for them.

So yes market cap is very important, especially for beginners that dream about impossible things, but after all it is just another stat that can change to certain level especially in long period of time.",1635022938,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qedgzd/market_cap_is_very_important_but_not_most/

I got greedy in March thinking I was a genius, put everything I could in April to only have it crash.

I was afraid in may and June but didn’t sell. I was trying to round up fiat but even then, I was always wondering if it would go lower.

The fact is none of us can time the market. If you could then you would leverage trade. However, you should always be in a position to come out ahead no matter what it does.

For instance, I wanted to get into matic and thought 1.22 was too high and wanted it to get down some more. I said screw I’ll put in a little bit (now it’s at 1.60).

I bought Vet when it was a 22c and then it crashed to 7c. I decided to put more in and now it’s climbing up to 14c+

So long as you don’t need the money immediately, red days will help with long term wealth accumulation. It’s much easier to 10-20x when you are buying a crypto at a 50% discount than at an ATH. 

This mild picante sauce dip is a good day to do weekly/monthly DCAs but don’t fret when the rest of your portfolio is down.

70,CryptoCurrency,Kilv3r,Crypto Stamps: a bullish sign towards mass adoption.,"If you were born like me in the last millennium, chances are that you, or someone you know, collected postage stamps.

This was one of the first collectibles I engaged with, long before Magic: The Gathering. I remember the excitement of waiting for the stamps to come off the water-soaked envelopes.

At that time, I was far from being the only one involved in stamp collectibles. Nowadays, this lost some mainstream attractivity.

But that might change thanks to the global adoption of NFTs.

 The Swiss national post launches Switzerland’s first crypto stamps.
The Swiss national post recently announced that they would launch the first Swiss Crypto stamp (on November 25, 2021). This new of a kind stamp will be composed of a physical and a digital part. The physical stamp will cost 8.90 CHF (approx. 9.71 USD on October 2021) and have a digital crypto image associated with it. 

After purchasing a stamp, people will be able to scan a QR code to reveal the digital counterpart. The digital crypto stamps will have different rarity levels, as it is common in the NFT space.

Swiss crypto stamps facts:

- 13 different designs
- Each NFT is stored on the Polygon Blockchain
- 65,000 copies of the most common digital design and 50 of the rarest
- 175,000 stamps available at launch

This collection of digital stamps shall relaunch the excitement for collecting, exchanging, and trading stamps. Only that this time, people will exchange their stamps on NFT platforms such as OpenSea.

Note that the Swiss crypto stamps are not the first ones to be produced. The neighboring country Austria previously released the very first crypto stamps in 2019.

 Why am I so bullish about this announcement.
Launching these crypto stamps means that a broad audience will have direct exposure to the NFT world. Imagine that now people will be able to buy NFTs from their local post office!

Soon, people will want to know more about NFTs and the cryptocurrency world in general. 

This is a step towards better education and mass adoption of cryptos, and the reason I am so bullish about this news.

My main issues are:

1. The so called Anti-Whale mechanic isn't described except the burn 2% distributed 2% to holders, if a set limit to sales exists, its not listed in their white paper or any other part of their site.
2. I don't see a single unique technical thing that this coin has going for it, even the name isn't ""MEME"" enough to make people direct buy into it 
3. The kinds of platforms and wallets they are talking about building with SaitamaMask take a very specific team skill set that I don't see in their founders (I see the sales, business, and a bit of tech but not web dev or a CTO that I have faith in)
4.  Offering the option to buy NFT's as well on their platform seems like an afterthought and not a well built plan 
5. A token that charges 2% per transaction then distributes that amount among holders seems to not incentive transactions and in fact only help long term large holders of the coin.

Its main strengths:

1. Got alot of hype, many people are already saying ""I made XXX% on Saitama Inu'
2. If they manage to launch a platform, it will look really good (Press X)

77,CryptoCurrency,inevitable_username,"""Every project is a scam or dead end until proven otherwise."" – DYOR strategy that will save you some cash","When you see a new crypto project you may feel this is the one: ground-breaking, low market cap, *clearly* undervalued... ""Why shouldn't I buy this coin?""

With this approach you'll definitely be left holding one too many heavy bags filled with regret...  

Believe me, they tried very hard to make you feel that FOMO. **You're their target audience.** They put a lot of effort to be that convincing and vague at the same time, to throw just the right amount of buzzwords on their landing page. Most projects spend more on their PR, website and social media than on their tech...

To save you from FOMO-ing into every new revolutionary coin, I suggest the following strategy:

**Every project is a scam (or a dead end) until proven legit.**

What it means is you should start looking into any project as if it is a scam OR as if it's dead in the water. Keep this in mind as long as you DYOR. Turn the tables – *they* have to tick all your boxes to convince you. 

By the time you start researching a project, the team has already revealed all they wanted to reveal on their website, in whitepaper, medium articles and such. If some information is not clear or missing – assume it's intentional.

Now other people knowing this creator tweeted him asking if it's really him. Just to make sure when they buy his art that it's legit. It wasn't and the original creator was upset about how easy it is to ""steal"" and make money off of his art that way.

This made me think. What if you just create some random 3D art in your basement at 2 o'clock in the morning under the influence of a good energy drink and great melodic dubstep and mint it and put it on opensea. Then 5 days later someone else just takes your png and mints it and puts it on SolSea.

I as a random boyfriend of your wife: how do I know who the original creator is? You could say look at the time stamp but what if I don't know about opensea and just happen to only use SolSea? You know what I mean?

https://np.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/qdmc74/anyone_else_having_an_issue_with_coinbase_card/hhnbw3f

This one comment is the only thing I can find admitting they're aware of the problem. One comment in one thread. No emails. No in app notifications. No tweets. No push notifications. Nothing. 


Fuck everyone who has something on autopay with this card I guess? I guess I'm just lucky I don't have anything important on it, and looking forward I'll make absolutely sure I don't.

Sorry this is wordy, I had the post rejected for a comment minimum which was pretty annoying, considering I didn't really need to say much to get my point across. Literally just rambling now. I'm on mobile so I can't check my post length.  Think I'll scream a bit to make sure I don't miss.

9,CryptoCurrency,creepy_robot,I have X amount of ONE in my metamask that's on harmony main net. I can't access this unless I'm logged into ViperSwap. How do I transfer this to the actual 'one' network?," I found some forgotten ONE in a wallet on my metamask. It's on a Harmony Main net network. If I try sending it, it starts with '0x' and I can't use 'one' as the receiving address. How do I transfer or convert this over so that it's in my actual ONE wallet on Guarda? 

I noticed I can swap for something like 1ETH or 1MATIC, but I'm afraid if I transfer that to my ETH or MATIC wallets that it's not a 1:1 bridge and that I'll lose everything forever.

11,CryptoCurrency,Amelie007,When is SafeMoon going to hit $1 in price?,"The answer is never. When it comes to matters of price it is important to keep a little perspective, and one of the best tools for doing that is to compare the marketcap of one coin to another. 

The crazy but more proper question would be like this: ""What would be the price of SafeMoon if it had the marketcap of Bitcoin"".

https://preview.redd.it/ttkr436v79v71.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7337142e4ac41ae53a879190bb46033a588e8495

So as you can see, even if SafeMoon somehow managed to achieve a marketcap valuation of $1.16 Trillion dollars, SafeMoon would still not even get close to $1 in price. When you look at the circulating supply of Bitcoin being close to 19 million and understand that the circulating supply of SafeMoon is 574 Trillion, that should also tell you why a $1 SafeMoon is an impossibility, as it would have to reach a marketcap that not even all the countries in the world combined have.

**You can go to** [**https://www.marketcapof.com/**](https://www.marketcapof.com/) **and start comparing the marketcap of one coin to another to get a better perspective.**

Another example; When is Cardano (ADA) going to be worth $4k just like Ethereum (ETH)?

The answer is never. Let's use the website now and compare them both to get a potential price that is not batshit crazy;

Also, to acknowledge in the best way I can just how immensely powerful Moons have been in shaping my own life in the past 12+ months and how I perceive the future. I can't wait to get back to classroom or in person teaching and use Moons as the perfect educational tool for my students and clients.

I'm pretty new to the NFT game and very much learning the ropes with Art, Photography etc. with a view to honing the craft and releasing an NFT collection in future which will also form an integral part of a turn-based blockchain game.

I'd appreciate any feedback regarding this or indeed any of my other NFTs in my collections, especially concerning how they are displayed, and whether the markdown meta data for exclusive content displays as it should.

NFTs are a super exciting emerging market that will eventually become ubiquitous throughout society for birth/land registry, certifications, authenticity declarations etc.

I highly recommend anyone takes a wee bit of time to learn how to mint the most basic NFT as it's a skill that will automatically put you ahead of the curve in pretty much any future industry.

Even if I don't ever sell a single NFT, the experience and learning process will be reward enough.

To ""Everydays: the First 5000 Days"" by beeple selling for $69.3 million. All this happening solely on the Ethereum Blockchain. Some believing that Ethereum is the only option. With gas fees being so high it has made it difficult for the average investor and potential artists to get involve. 

There are other known blockchains that have become popular for NFTs.
Examples;
WAX 
Cadano
Binance
Polygon 
Tezos 
Flow 
and even RVN and Algorand

What some crypto enthusiast may not know is you can have Bitcoin backed NFTs as well. These are different to Ethereum NFTs and others listed because they do not exist solely Bitcoin Blockchain. As explained by crytonews
 
""While NFTs “on Bitcoin” don’t exist purely on the Bitcoin blockchain (in a way that ERC721 tokens exist on Ethereum), they are secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. The additional tech stack that powers the ability to issue and secure NFTs with Bitcoin is provided by the likes of Counterparty, Stacks, and the Liquid Network. "" 

An already popular collection of Bitcoin NFTs are the Rare Pepe NFTs. These can be found on Scarce City. There users can sell physical artwork as well as NFTs for Bitcoin. The Rare Pepe collection is powered by Counterparty. Counterparty is an open source protocol built on top of the Bitcoin network that uses the Bitcoin Blockchain to record data. 

The creator of the collection has stated 

""By securing NFTs on Bitcoin, these digital collectible cards arguably have a chance of lasting longer than NFTs secured by newer chains that may end up disappearing (or forking) in a few years’ time. For NFT holders, that is something to consider. """,1635018479,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qec28f/incase_you_missed_it_bitcoin_nfts/

52,CryptoCurrency,UnexperiencedIT,These are the reasons why I believe in Harmony ONE,"So why do I believe in ONE?

&amp;#x200B;

1. The project is still young so the price of ONE should keep increasing. Their market cap rank is only $2.5B which is nothing for most of the coins we have.
2. Gas fees are very low and transactions are very fast. Once you try transactions with Harmony ONE you won't like using another one. Basically, the fees are so low that it is impossible to print them in fiat currency for example. One ONE can serve you a long way.
3. Promising Road Map (Go check it out I am not sure if it is allowed to put that link on this sub)
4.  It is one of the first sharded blockchains to provide staking. Additionally, Harmony also introduced cross-chain loans, which is the first non-custodial cross-chain lending protocol. 
5.  You can store your ONE token on compatible wallets like Ledger, Trust Wallet, Harmony browser extension and more
6. Harmony launched an Ethereum-Harmony cross-chain bridge with the name of Horizon.
7. Bridge with Bitcoin should come by the end of the month or in the next month, not sure when though
8. The bridge is a secured group of validators, who submit their confirmations through the multi-signature contract
9. The team behind Harmony is a combination of engineering experts and academic research. 
10. ONE still hasn't had a massive growth, it is slow and steady. But it reached a new ATH yesterday.  
11. Harmony is cryptocurrency investment that I have both for passion of the project and profitable achievements.

56,CryptoCurrency,Nervous_Sky_5167,"Nobody went to jail for the 2008 recession: This is why crypto exists, this is why we are here.","TL;DR: A rant about banks and how ridiculously corrupt financial services are today.   


In the early 2008s, a bunch of wealthy banks decided it was a good idea to sell unbacked, sub-prime mortgages. This was the practice of giving mortgages to individuals that had so bad credit scores/ low income, it was nearly impossible for them to pay it back. To compensate for this 'risk', these *subprime* *mortgages* charged higher interest rates, which were FAR more profitable than the *prime mortgages* they were used to selling. As more and more banks piled on this train and the subprime bubble grew, it only would take a few defaults to set off an explosion. And that it did.

After the US banks bailed out these banks, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, just to name a few, were fined **fractions** of their profits. Only 54.4 billion dollars were fined from the largest banks involved, their crimes which had cost the global economy **30 trillion dollars of wealth**. Over 9 million Americans alone lost their jobs, or 6 % of the total workforce, but that wasn't even the worst of it. 

After these banks screwed up subprime mortgages, they used the bail-out money to robot foreclose MOST mortgages, which ended up in one of the worst real-estate dumps, and as a result, 13 trillion dollars worth of homeowner net worth was wiped clean. Robo-foreclosure is the extremely lazy, indiscriminate practice of EVICTING a homeowner and then LIQUIDATING their home to cover the bank's portion of the mortgage, without even considering the mortgage's quality or status. 

**And the crazy part of this all? NOBODY, NOT A SINGLE BANKER WENT TO JAIL FOR THIS.** 

All the youngster's still reading, you think this was bad? Research fractional reserve banking, the practice where banks routinely credit lend your deposited money for interest farming and then pay you a small surplus of what they earn. That's how banks earn most of their money, through lending. And oh my god, does it reak havoc. 

When your deposit of 100$ is blended to another bank at an interest rate, the credit present in the world nearly doubles. Banks are required to secure at least 10% of the original deposit, but the other 90% are lent out, creating 100$ of ghost money in your account, and another 90$ of real money in a loan borrower's account. And this happens successfully, 90$ gets loaned into 81$, and that gets loaned into 73$... Suddenly, an additional 144$ was created out of thin air from your deposit! 

Now when you withdraw your 100$, in a linear world, the 144$ of loan ghost money is suddenly wiped. Now think what would happen if more than just a few people took out their money. Does anyone here still remember the Greece Euro financial crisis? Everyone withdrew their money until all that was left was ghost money. BILLIONS of the inflated economy LOST in seconds. 

And here's just a list of atrocities banks have:

\- The fact that, by policy, your deposited money is not owned by you, but becomes the property of the bank, and that you have ZERO right to that money. 

\- The fact that over 35% of the US dollar's entire existence was printed from February 2020 to 2021. Don't believe me? Look below:

&amp;#x200B;

[A 35&amp;#37; recent rise in TOTAL MONEY SUPPLY \(M2\) of the US dollar. Look at how small of a blimp the 2008 Recession was compared to how bad things are now.](https://preview.redd.it/3evwka6k29v71.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd314097651155dfad934098835c05ebe333b2ab)

\- The fact that just like any other 'speculative asset', does the US dollar also have restricted liquidity. You probably wondering, if 35% inflation is backed up in a single year, why isn't everything on fire? Due to low distribution since the Pandemic has lowered spending, money doesn't exchange hands fast enough as of right now to fully distribute 35% inflation. Check this post for more info: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/osfxr5/the\_postpandemics\_upcoming\_economic\_fallout\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/osfxr5/the_postpandemics_upcoming_economic_fallout_on/)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, ok, I suppose that's enough for a single post. To any newbies out there, this is why crypto was initially created. The very first, decentralized blockchain crypto that started it all was Bitcoin. 

I don't care whether your crypto achieves zero transaction fees, or whether is environmentally sustainable because of Proof Of Stake (PoS), **we must all look back at our roots and realize why we are here in the first place, and what we inevitably fight for.**

Hi, i tried getting into margin trading for the first time, just trying to clarify a thing or two.

Could someone please tell me exactly how are the fees/interest calculated on binance? I found this formula on their site: I (interest) = P (borrowed money) \* R (daily interest 0.02%/24) \* T (in hours) , and i saw somewhere that they charge 0,1% (or whatever amount) of the borrowed amount per hour. Does it mean that you're paying both the hourly fees on the amount you borrowed plus the daily interest?

For exemple, with a 1000€ collateral and a X5 leverage in a long, would it mean that i couldn't let it run for too many days, orelse i'd have to pay some stupidly high fees? 

If that is the case, could you recommand any other exchange that would be more advantageous, if there is any? Thanks.",1635015632,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qeb4ua/how_does_binance_margin_trading_really_work/

You wouldn't tell others how much you have in the bank, would you? You wouldn't tell people the size of your IRA either. **So why would you tell anyone how much crypto you have?** It is literally an asset that can be sent instantly and irreversibly to a criminal... with a knife to your throat.

Crypto ""merch"" advertises to the world that you have some of the asset and almost certainly ***more of other crypto assets.*** There are two reasons that I hear from people for why they have crypto swag.

1. **I want to spread awareness**

The people who would buy a crypto after seeing it on a t-shirt are the wrong ~~idiots~~ people to get into crypto. They're going to call it a scam every time the price goes below their purchase price. Generally, if you do anything because a t-shirt says to... you're an idiot.

- People will either think you're a nerd.

- Or people will think you're rich.

Do you really want the people who see you to think any combination of those things about you? Robbers see someone with a crypto t-shirt and probably think to themselves, ""This guy is a rich nerd; a perfect target for me.""

This is equivalent to 51.8% of the country’s gold reserve, 7.4% of the total remittance or 1.3% of total reserve. The dip alone is worth $1.25 per capita, almost the same as an hour of minimum wage.","To date, the country has bought Bitcoins several times:

On 07-Sep-2021: 400 BTC for $21M

On 08-Sep-2021: 150 BTC for $7M

On 20-Sep-2021: 150 BTC for $6.4M

Total so far: 700 BTC for $34.4M

At the current price of $61,389; these 700 BTC is now worth $43M. That means El Salvador has gained $8.6M on the dip.

To understand how big is $43M in El Salvador’s context:

El Salvador’s total remittance is $583.85M. Compared to the value of holdings, it represents 7.4% of total remittance.

El Salvador’s reserve is $3.292B. So, the total Bitcoin holding is 1.3% of the total reserve.

El Salvador’s gold reserve is $83M. So the current value of Bitcoin holding is 51.8%, just over half of the country’s gold reserve.

And how big is the dip gain ($8.6M)? If this amount is distributed to every person in El Salvador, everyone will be better off by $1.25.

Again, how big is $1.25 in El Salvador? It is almost the minimum wage for commerce, service, industrial, and agroindustrial sectors ($1.50 an hour, $12.00 per day)

Every time I read a post that says don’t worry, we’re “Still Early” it makes me want to liquidate my entire portfolio. 

Crypto has a market cap of: 2.6 trillion.

The World GDP? 81 Trillion.

That doesn’t matter though. Because everyone’s heard of bitcoin for 5-10 years. People have short attention spans and they forget that adopting new technology takes time. 

People have been so endeared to the fact that ‘technology is speeding up’ that they think 5 years is enough that they’ve already missed out.

I’m not saying this is a bad investment. In fact, once Crypto streamlines global finances and blockchain tech gets utilized in businesses around the world, that World GDP is likely to get much higher. Crypto is going to take up a larger and larger percentage of that as it happens.

But for the LOVE OF GOD, stop saying, “we’re still early.”

10 times to get above $1,000. 

17 times to get above $100,000

20 times to get over $1,000,000.

It's been sitting around $1 to $1.10 and it shows no signs of moving (without BTC's assistance) until the SEC case is closed, which is NOW projected to be early to mid-2022. I feel it would be a waste to own as it feels like the market is on an upturn and is about to do crazy things so why basically own a stablecoin when everything else is going to be making positive moves? I'd rather reinvest it into some projects with more potential like ATOM or Tezos or maybe some smallcaps like CKB or Proton/XPR that have their whole life ahead of them. And yeah, I know when the SEC case ends 'XRP will go to the moon' (maybe 2 or 3x) but by that point, I can make gains in other areas and reinvest into it.",1635011365,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe9qay/so_what_do_you_do_with_a_project_you_think_is/

94,CryptoCurrency,jgarcya,Attention all Governors,"To all my fellow Algo governors.... 

It has come to my attention that rewards will not be available to roll over into period one of next year...

So all of us governor will have to wait to roll over our rewards to compound in q2... This means we will be behind on quarter of compounding interest...

Why is this... Our first governance period ends... Dec 31st 2021...

But you have to commit algos for the next period b4 the new one q1 starts in Jan 1st 2022...

Our rewards will not be given b4 the new commitment period starts.

What do we do in order to maximize our compounding interest...

Here's what I am doing...

I am adding more Algo to my wallet before the end of this year... I will double my holdings(plus max 32%, which is the max reward given)...

By doing this I will be able to take advantage of all the potential compounding interest possibilities.

By doing this I will be ahead of everyone else, that does not do this...

And in compounding, the sooner you start, the greater the return...

So if I cover the max reward myself... I compound an additional 32% in q1 of next year, while others will have to wait till q2 to compound their rewards from the first Gov period.

Let's say you start q4 2021 with 100 algo.

Q4 100 reward 20%  = 120
Q1 100 algo reward 20% = 120
Q2 120 algo reward 20% = total 144 algo plus 20(q4)=164
Q3 164 algo reward 20% = 196.8 algo.


But if you add the reward yourself... You can compound right away...

Q4 100algo at 20% = 120
Q1 120 algo at 20% = 144 
Q2 144 algo ( plus the 20% earned q4 = 20) equals 164algos committed) at 20% = 196.8 algo...

By doing what I'm doing I'll double my algo in 3 quarters instead of 4.

In my own humble opinion the war on crypto is something that can escalate depending on if the goverments start losing control of their only source of power which is FIAT.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I got into crypto, I've been looking for ways to take advantage of the massive volatility in the market, however every time I've tried to trade on my own I get crushed.  I spent some time looking into algorithmic trading that the big fish do and everything I found was a proprietary paid service.  I'm not much of a coder so writing my own code and integrating an API wasn't a good option for me either.

&amp;#x200B;

Superalgos is a project I found that is so under the radar it honestly took me a while to find it, even when it was exactly what I was looking for.  It's everything I could have dreamed of.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously guys, this thing has an amazing graphic interface and tutorials that detail how to build or use bots.  The team behind it has been working on it for four years now and are at the point where they've integrated machine learning and AI.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not here to shill, it's not a paid service and I'm not a contributor.  I searched this sub and found almost nothing about it, and it deserves more attention.  The entire premise behind it is that the algos evolve within the ecosystem as the community grows and more people contribute.  

&amp;#x200B;

Take a look, I'd love to hear what you guys think and if you have any algo experience!

5,CryptoCurrency,StudentForAllMyLife,Siacoin and decentralized storage,"I'll begin off with explaining what the difference between centralized storage (current popular storage architecture) and decentralized storage (Siacoin). 


Centralized storage in simple words is saving all the data that someone has in one place, for example Facebook or any other platform saves all of Its users data in its private servers. Therefore a hacker could focus on Facebook and try to breach it (as it always have already happened) since it's a single point of failure. While decentralized storage is saving your data in different servers(computers) without risking security. Therefore hacking a decentralized storage system is much more difficult.

11,CryptoCurrency,kola401,So glad I didn't buy a mekaverse NFT,"If you don't know what mekaverse is, it's an NFT that had a huge audience and hype.

200,000 people lined up to buy one at the price of 0.2 ETH, but only around 8k was available for sale. They had this raffle thing like a lottery ticket to decide who gets to buy one and who couldn't. Many people, me included, didn't get a chance to buy one.

After these NFTs entered the open market, they were priced at 5 ETH/each. That's how crazy it was. 0.2 to mint, resold at 5ETH. The people that won the chance to buy one, basically won lottery tickets.

Many people, me included, were incredibly disappointed we didn't even get the chance to buy. But here's the scary part. Many tried to buy from the openmarket at 5 ETH because the FOMO was getting wild.

Many people that bought them at 5 ETH lost a lot of money because now they are being resold for 1.5 ETH. 

1) bought at minting price, I would have made some nice 5 figure profits.

2) If I bought after they entered the open market at peak FOMO, I would have lost 5 figures.

Small lesson here.

1) If you can buy into an early project with great FOMO, and get it at the original price (not resold), do it.

2) Be careful of FOMO. Prices tend to go down after FOMO.

2) Be very cautious of NFTs. The risk to reward is unnecessarily high. Many people lost a lot of money buyng Mekaverse.",1635009997,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe9a1d/so_glad_i_didnt_buy_a_mekaverse_nft/
12,CryptoCurrency,TrafficConeWriter,Polynomial Regression Models for (some) Top Cryptos,"I was running some numbers out of interest to see what regression models would say about some cryptos I am into. I figured I would share.

A quick statistics background, a regression model is calculated based on the historical data. I pulled 5 years of the crypto's daily high price (note: not all cryptos have 5 years of data). The R-squared value is an evaluation of how accurate the model is. In statistics terms, the R-squared value is defined as ""the amount of variation in the historical data accounted for by the model equation."" In other words, the closer to 1 the R-squared value is, the more accurate the model's projects will be.

As a general reference, typically in projection models, anything about 0.65 is considered pretty good at projecting the future, and anything about 0.90 is considered very reliable.

Here is the summary of the projections for 1 year from today:

&amp;#x200B;

[1 year projections](https://preview.redd.it/6050czcbf8v71.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=376044eb9724eb09c7e882d7ddfd725c1d5e278d)

Based on the data, Solana will have a 744% increase over the next year. The R-squared for this model is 0.8715, which is actually pretty high. However, to assume the value will actually jump 744% would probably be pretty insane based on logic and reason, nevertheless, this model seems very promising.

BTC has a 97% projected increase, and this number I take more significantly. Also take note of the two columns to the far right. The % low means the model is confident in the value being above 62%, but it means it is not very likely the increase will be above 140%.

You can take a look at some of the rest of the values, but most of them seem promising.

BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, and ALGO are the coins I was really interested in, DOGE I added because, well I don't know I figured people would want to know.

BTC, ETH, ADA, and SOL all had R-squared values above 0.8, so to me I would have some faith in these models. 

Another important thing to note would be that the more data there is, the more accurate the model will be. BTC, ETH, DOGE all actually had 5 years of data, ADA had about 4 years, and SOL and ALGO had around 2 years.

I'll post the actual trends with their trendlines and their equations below. In each case, the top equation is the polynomial value and the bottom value is the linear equation. I never actually did any calculations based on the linear equations because linear equations wouldn't really be a good projection of crypto trends.

On a final note, the disclaimers. This is not financial advice, do your own research, and statistical projections are always going to be risky for financials. I personally will probably use these projects, but in no way to I expect something like 700% increase in any SOL investments.

I hope this helps for people, but if we are being honest, numbers and statistics like this sometimes seemingly don't add anything to decision making.

33,CryptoCurrency,anakanin,Mega bullish: Japanese have 10 bank accounts per adult on average and their banks started going negative interest rate!,"
Lately several central banks in Europe have implemented a negative interest rate policy aka NIRP on excess bank reserves in the financial system. Japan is the next country that will be affected with the NIRP. 

For a country where there are 7 national banks operating and many, many other megabanks and postal banks, residents are estimated to have as much as 8-10 accounts per adult on average. This is mega ultra bullish. Not resident but adult, keep that in mind. 

I used to live in Japan in my youth and people store insane amount of money across several different banks in order to get those sweet returns. And crypto is far from popular there. US and EU is years ahead in terms of adoption compared to Japan where its still almost unheard of to be holding crypto. People think Japan is super ahead of others when it comes to tech but its quite the opposite. Fax machines are still the king of sending the documentation and important data in banks. 

According to the data from Bank Of Japan, there are approximately 920,000,000 reported bank accounts in Japan. Given that there are about 125 million people in Japan and about 13% are children this brings you to about 10 accounts per adult on average. 


According to the latest [Statista report](https://www.statista.com/topics/7629/banking-industry-in-japan/#topicHeader__wrapper) the banks assets in Japan are worth above 18.5 trillion dollars. Coinbase knows that and thats exactly why they decided to go in Japan now. They see this opportunity of a lifetime.

With negative interest hitting the Japanese hard, we will very likely see a massive influx of people coming to crypto. And when that happens…market will go insane. Mark my words",1635008954,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe8xqx/mega_bullish_japanese_have_10_bank_accounts_per/
35,CryptoCurrency,HulkingBrain,"An “exit strategy”, in both Life and Crypto","I find that a complicating factor when investing in crypto is that the space is so young, that potential returns are enormous once you start pushing the goal posts back a few years, or a decade, or two decades. Any exit strategy that I come up with seems premature.  What’s a 300% win if a 1000% win might require just a little more patience?  When should I sell an asset that keeps rising in value, year by year?

This is where I think it’s useful to become a bit more existential and death-oriented (the other great exit) in my thinking.  There’s a useful exercise that some therapists employ, where you draw a line on a piece of paper about 10 inches long.  Imagine this line is how long you’re going to live. The beginning of the line is your birth, and the end of the line is your death.  Now, mark on that line where you think you might be.  How much life do you have left?   How much time?  

Now start to imagine what you want to accomplish with what’s left of your time line.  House and kids?  Do you want to start your own business?  Write an publish a book? Record a music album?  Leave your loved ones financial security?  Study vipassana meditation like a monk for a few years?  What’s the thing that you would do that would endow your life with meaning, that you would be proud of when you’re reflecting backwards on your death bed?

Whatever project that will give your life meaning will no doubt come with costs on your time, your energy and your material wealth.  It’s the last of these costs that, in my opinion, are the ultimate consideration when considering an ‘exit strategy’ in crypto.  For me, I have a rather specific life project that, once I can afford to do it, I’ll cash in on my investments—and not a day before that.",1635008893,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe8x0d/an_exit_strategy_in_both_life_and_crypto/
44,CryptoCurrency,Wannaberich_83,Market Cap," There has been discussion of Market Cap and how a lot of people have hopium without really understanding Market Cap and coin circulation effects. I wanted to post a breakdown of a couple coins, some I own and some that are highly discussed, for those to see how how the coin circulation and market cap effects a coins value in USD. I hope this is assistance for those just getting into crypto to have reasonable expectations in the future of their investment. I know I got into things thinking I could just get rich with coins with big circulation supply and not really knowing or understanding the effects with supply and Market Cap.

46,CryptoCurrency,FunContest8489,Rules for casuals,"Ok so I keep seeing posts about things for crypto beginners to know, etc. I’m a casual investor, i.e. I don’t have thousands to put in, don’t do a ton of research, and there’s a whole hell of a lot I don’t know about crypto, blockchain, etc. But I’ve been pretty successful with it (~ +800% return overall). So here are my rules for casual investors who don’t want to spend all their free time researching/checking charts and don’t have $10k to YOLO into projects they like. 

1. HODL. One of the things I learned really quickly is that chasing short term gains, by chasing market volatility, can make you money. However, it’s a lot of work, hard to get right (read: risky), and really requires an understanding of markets, graphs/charts, trend patterns, etc. As a casual, it’s much easier, and likely more profitable, to buy things that are likely to grow and just hold them. 

2.  Don’t panic! The crypto market is super volatile. Which means that things can change in the space of a minute. It also means that things can change back just as quickly. If something goes down, just wait. Unless you bought into something sketchy (see rule 3), it’ll probably go back up eventually. 

3. Buy from reputable exchanges (except Robinhood, fuck Robinhood). If a coin is tradeable on Coinbase, Voyager, etc. it’s probably not going to FULLY collapse. Obviously there are exceptions to this statement (don’t @ me), but it’s a much better bet than some random shit coin you heard about on telegram and traded into on a DEX. 

4. DCA is your friend. If you can, DCA is a great way to mitigate risk. This doesn’t need any more explanation I don’t think…

5. Avoid FOMO. If a coin is spiking, you’re probably too late. There will always be another meme coin/pump and dump you can take advantage of. Don’t worry if you missed this one. If you FOMO in at ATH and it only goes up another 5%, you aren’t going to take profits because you’re chasing the big win. You’re going to lose value and be stuck waiting for another pump. 

6. Diversify. Don’t just pick one. Put a little bit into several coins. Most successful strategies I’ve seen have relied on spreading investment around to take advantage of multiple things rising. And, if something goes down, you aren’t losing as much. 

That’s it. If anyone has additions or changes they think would be good I’d love to hear them.",1635008216,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe8ooi/rules_for_casuals/
49,CryptoCurrency,vvb777,Note to Shitcoin Investors/Gamblers 🚨🚨,"With ALT season upon us we must warn newcomers about investing into shitcoins and turning their investment into -90%. Yes you may get the timing right and invest and start to see your coin(s) pumping but don't get fooled and start investing more into that project as a result of FOMO. Most cases that coin isn't pumping because of any technological superiority to other crypto instead it's just a case of HYPE that could last a while but could die so so so quickly and when it does and you see those red its going to be redder than blood and cause you sleepless nights checking those charts in hope of recovering your investment.

DOGE explosion in the crypto world has propelled other projects ambitions to create coins with no use or future that is bad for the future of crypto because of the ponzi characteristics. People need to understand MARKET CAP and it application to a realistic growth potential. Its also important to note that there could be a massive swing in market cap due to volatility however understanding market cap and its application to realistic growth is very important and proves to be a great method of project evaluation.

Your shitcoin could never reach the status of BTC or ETH by just HODLing yes you may have heard of people who got gains but did you hear about the thousands who lost thousands. Invest in BTC and ETH and DYOR while you look for suitable projects to invest in. Many suggest DCA investing and attest by it being almost certain for gains so it's worth researching and trying. Don't invest what your are not willing to loose

82,CryptoCurrency,BrownTransGirl,Newbies: You should learn why it's true that an actual algorithmic stablecoin coin could be the highest market cap crypto. And why that doesn't mean you should 'invest' in any stablecoin that exist currently.,"Let's get some info out of the way:



Current stablecoins are pegged to individual fiats, which have their own issues. USDC for example is pegged to the us dollar. CBDC, Central bank digital currencies? Not decentralized, and not what I'm talking about. They'll stay pegged to fiats. You can hold money in them for bear times, but otherwise they're not what will be the Web3 revolution that adds a payment layer to the Internet becomes mainstream for. 


Let's check in on Bitcoin


Bitcoin is very like gold, and eventually, all scarce things find their price. Will that scarcity be enough to be more valueable in market cap to a coin that can be transacted around the world and even off world? 



Hell no.

So, I'm possibly expecting to receive some form of NFT in the future, and was looking at cold hardware wallets to store them securely. Offline.

I stumbled upon 2 brands that really stick out for me:

Ledger and Trezor (Keepkey also seemed interesting, but I'm worried it isn't as safe).

Anyways,

There's issues with them that are making it difficult to decide which one to get.

Mainly:

Ledger: data leak and tiny screen.
Trezor: can be brute forced.


Anyway, these are some of the main differences I've noticed simply by reading reviews..

Pros:

Ledger: sleek, cheaper, dual-chip.
Trezor: open-source, larger screen, shamir backup.

Things that give me pause:

Ledger: S can only hold 3-4apps?(what does that mean and does it matter to me? I think the NFT will be on Eth).

Trezor: Pricier..  budget is at the moment a concern for me. But if one is definitely safer than the rest, I'll pay up.

Thanks for any help, sorry I'm a complete noob at this stuff, I'm just catching up to crypto/NFT...

42,CryptoCurrency,jgarcya,This is why I'm rarely in the red,"I'm poor... An artist, was homeless( couch surfing, but employed).... Had little money to invest due to too much debt....

But that was the past..... Except being poor.

I managed to elimininate a major bill, over 14yrs of paying it....

Here's why I'm rarely in the red.

I was gifted my first $100 in btc in 2018 @ btc= 10,000.... I also used faucets to gather btc, eth, ltc, and bch.

I was lucky to find Bob loukas and his 4 yr cycle of btc, in early 2019.....

Then I was lucky enough to find coinflip ATM... Where I could buy btc,ltc, and eth.

So in March 2019, the start of the 4 yr cycle.... I started taking every extra bit of money, after my bills, and put it in ATM... I was buying pieces of btc for 3800, ltc for less than $40, and eth for under $200...

This was just $20- $100 at a time... No more than $200/mo....

2019 btc ran up really fast.... I wasn't able to keep up.. I had a goal of owning 1btc.... Never happened.

But then, as time went buy, I started buying more and more btc.... When it dipped 10% I went and put $100 on it.... Every dip I could buy I bought.

The crash of March 2020... Btc went from 10k- 3800... I bought every dip... But only small portions...

Then came the run up of 2020...10k- 30k very quickly... I stopped buying btc at $11,500...

In May of 2020, I finally decided to buy some doge...
I found an ATM to get some 3.5 hrs away... Paid an 16% fee, but bought $140 worth at .003... Doge was my long shot.

Still acquired more ltc..... But stopped buying eth( stupid)....

2021 still bought more doge, and bought more eth at $1800...after we saw highs of 3-4k... I bought the dip!.

So here it is current 2021... My last purchase was ALGO... Just to lock it up in governance at 5.7- 32%.

Knowing the 4 yr cycle... I refused to buy btc in 2021, knowing it will retrace 70-80 % in 2022...

I couldn't justify.... Bringing my average up... I average btc at less than 8k...

All of my holdings are in massive gains 300% - 8000%... Except algo( but this is a different play.. Passive income).

So I got to ride out all of 2020 after March in the plus... All of 2021 in the plus...

All of 2022 will be in the plus( even though it will be a down year).... Bc I didn't chase ATH...

In 2023... At the next 4 yr cycle.... I will take saved up fiat, and buy more btc/eth/ltc.... And doge if it drops below .10...

I sleep great at night knowing... I don't have to worry about dips of 30% or 50%... 

I know most here think DCA is the best strategy... Just set a time buy a set amount every 2 wks or month.... And yes it works...

But for me.... I only buy depending on where we are in the 4 yr cycle.... I don't buy the bull run(except wth at 50% off)..... 

I won't buy in the bear of 2022.... I won't try to catch a falling knife.... I'll wait till it hits the ground, then pick it up in 2023...

People say you can't time the market.... That's not necessary... Just know the cycles, and buy the dips... The bigger the dip the better.

I have turned a couple k into 5 digits... And possibly 6 at the end of the bull run....

Never in the red again.

Hope this helps others... Patience and knowing the 4 yr cycle is key...",1635004846,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe7ku3/this_is_why_im_rarely_in_the_red/

She told me stocks are the old way of investing so me being new I’m listening to her. Then I started to do my own research and realized with the stocks your returns “could” be very beneficial. So I started reading books, material online and YouTube and the occasional Reddit post. After talking to a friend and the returns he’s been getting investing in crypto is very appealing. So I’ve been doing my research and like what I see. But also have been seeing negative comments and articles saying stay away from crypto very volatile and could lose your life savings. Well to me same goes for stocks. So I continue on with my research and doing my DD and found that one trading platform offers visas and your earnings could be transferred to the visa. Nice I like that!! I sign up and start seeing hype about Shiba and other ones and start researching online the various coins. Now I’m very interested but keep seeing a lot of posts and articles to stay away!. I believe crypto is here to stay and yes very volatile but some good returns. If your not a professional stay away!! But I don’t want to I want to learn more about this and go for those nice gains. That being said how many and be honest, can say they are new to investing and are self taught and can learn from YouTube videos and even Reddit and made it work in the crypto world. I’ve read don’t day and swing trade crypto, buy and hold. But see lots are successful at day and swing trading. All the positive and negative make it harder to decide if one keeps going.

Most of it is controlled by very few big companies, it's constantly used as a tool of manipulation and advertisement, and a weapon against the working class. Sure, it has made some changes in our lifes yes but, is your life really better because of it?  


Let me be clear, I'm not saying the Internet is a bad thing. I think is a wonderful concept. But human nature does not deal very well with wonderful things. It always ends up boiling things down to a matter of dominance. And it will do the same with crypto.  


Hopefully crypto will end up beeing (like the internet) a very small step in the right direction for humanity (and a very big step for some of us lucky bastards :P )",1635004040,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe7bhv/cryptocurrencies_and_blockchain_wont_be_the/
65,CryptoCurrency,Poopasite1,What are some ways an average person can benefit from crypto?,"I’ve been thinking that for me crypto is extremely beneficial for a plethora of reasons but mainly because i enjoy to explore the tech behind it.

I think a common goal in the crypto space is for it to somehow go mainstream but as for right now, I struggle to find reasons as to why an average person who has no interest in trading/investing can benefit from it. 

If somebody asks tells you that they are interested in crypto and the hype how would you introduce them?

I think this is how I would introduce because it’s how I got into it.

1. Create an account on an exchange with support for the bank of your local country

2. Start with a small sum that their willing to lose to buy an amount of 3-5 or so different coins.

3. Read into the features of each coin and play around with the features, move coins from wallet to wallet understanding transaction fees etc.

4. (Only when more comfortable with losing money.)Try DeFi staking, adding liquidity to pools etc.

My question is what are some more services or ways/things that beginners to the space can utilise cryptocurrency?",1635003597,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe7640/what_are_some_ways_an_average_person_can_benefit/

Later that evening I ended up coming across the most ludicrous new released shitcoin I had ever seen on Binance Scam Chain. And figured I’d throw a $100 as that’s what I would have spent on the night out. 

This was just purely for shits and giggles and I forgot about it a week later I checked the charts of the shitcoin just to see how much it would be down only to find out it had gone on an insane run and I was in profit to the tune of thousands of dollars. 

Of course I took out 40x my investment and let the rest ride as a clown market shit happens insurance. But as I was cashing out in increments as I had enough to completely tank the price.

I joined the Telegram just to see if there was any news. And nope zero news whatsoever... just a ton of shilling and hype and getting new suckers to buy into the shitcoin with zero usecase. Someone new would ask if they are still early and how to buy and all the shillers would say “it’s the next Shib” and “hop in don’t miss the 1000x”. 

And seeing all the buy orders with some people throwing in thousands I just felt bad. As I was dumping my bags to the next lineup of idiots while making a killing. And the pump is unsustainable so they will likely be left holding their bags.

71,CryptoCurrency,Some1fromReddit,"Because of Cryptocurrency, I'm never going to be able to swim in the ocean ever again.","Cryptocurrency has opened my eyes to everything that goes on in this world.   Especially the fact of how criminal networks operate.

After researching how criminals use cryptocurrency to evade taxes, and launder money, I decided to see what else criminals use to do illegal things. 

I found that many are using the ocean by placing boats on it to transport drugs, weapons, and stolen goods.     

  If you support using the ocean , you support it's existence, and as long as we keep using the ocean to fish, going on trips, and swim, we are indirectly telling criminals that they have the ability to use the ocean too...  For their illegal activities.  And I'm taking a stand now, and never using the ocean for anything again. 

The fact is, deep in international waters, there isn't much regulation.  There isn't enough eyes on it, and anything can be going on out there.    Especially pirates.  

So one someone tells you they like going in the ocean, remind them of all the illegal things that take place in it.    They should feel bad.     Educate them on the dangers.",1635003303,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe72oq/because_of_cryptocurrency_im_never_going_to_be/

If you are making profit on a coin and want to cash out so you can invest in another always use the convert option. When you sell and invest in another coin there is the fee you will pay. The fee equals losing money, not a lot depending on how much you are cashing out but that fee can go in another coin instead of losing it. When you convert your profit to another coin you get more of that coin than you would selling and buying that coin. 

I've been doing this the whole time since I've been I crypto and it has compounded my money over time. I'm not going to lie, I cashed out once and realized I made a amateur mistake. Only cash out if you need the money

82,CryptoCurrency,fuzzyduck88,How would you make your crypto untraceable / hide it long term?,"So to start I want to clarify: this is NOT for tax purposes or ANYTHING to do with tax. Also as a matter of FACT this would also NOT be classed as money laundering as one of the proofs for money laundering is that the money was the “proceeds of criminal conduct”. It’s fully legal to hide any legitimate money. Please don’t turn it into a conversation about anything illegal. There are strict rules here. 

This came to light from a conversation I was having with a friend about divorce and the the age old myth of losing your keys “in a boating accident” so that you wouldn’t have to give away half. 

I’m not getting divorced or anything. This was about a famous person who had recently been divorced and practically lost everything and how he could have avoided it. 

Although there’s no way of proving the keys weren’t lost in an accident I don’t believe this would last in court given the burden of proof in civil cases is only based on probability. If it would be safe to say “given the facts heard, he probably didn’t lose the keys”…then you’re screwed. 
This is obviously different to a criminal case where it has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 

So, back to the beginning. How would one hide their crypto so it’s impossible for someone with full access to your bank accounts to to determine if you own some or not?(I.e - they can see you deposited money on an exchange). Or is it even possible?

My theory was the best way is to “muddy the waters” to an extent that it just becomes impossible to determine where the money is. (was it spent, gambled, invested further etc). To do this would mean spending a bit on fees:

(1)Transfer from exchange to a private wallet.
(2) Transfer from wallet to gambling site
(3) Transfer from gambling site to another wallet. 
(4) Transfer from wallet to a new unused hardware wallet such as trezor etc. 
(5) Bury wallet for years.

15,CryptoCurrency,No_Weather682,10 Most Common Mistakes Crypto Beginners Make,"**1-** **Thinking that a coin with very low price has greater potential**

I’ve seen too many people saying “If Bitcoin is at $60.000 it shouldn’t be very difficult for SHIBA INU to reach $1”. Nope, that’s not how it works. You can’t compare the price of cryptocurrencies by their USD value, because they have different amounts in supply. 

**2-** **Not having a strategic plan**

This is a common mistake made by many beginners that start investing before having a plan. They end up buying too late or selling too early for not having an entrance/exit strategy.

**3-** **Getting Scared of Market Volatility**

You can’t expect a 10x in your portfolio if you can’t handle a +20% loss. A lot of newbies get scared of market volatility and end up panic selling. But if you want to stick around you need to understand that cryptocurrencies are very volatile.

**4-** **Falling for Scams**

There are all types of scams (influencers promoting a scam coin, fake emails or fake promotions), but it’s crucial to recognize them if you don’t want to lose all your money. Why would a random person double the amount of money you send him? Exactly, never give personal information to nobody. 

**5-** **Being too lazy to DYOR**

Too many people want to get rich in crypto yet are too lazy to do mínimum research.  If you don’t understand the crypto you’re investing in and only listen to “experts”, you will get into big trouble and lose a lot of money.

**6-** **Investing money they can’t afford to lose**

A lot of beginners throw all their savings or loan funds to crypto without considering that they could lose it. Always remember, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.

**7-** **FOMO’ing/FUD**

Falling for FOMO or FUD is something that almost everyone fall for when entering the crypto space. It’s important to not fall for emotions when investing/trading so you don’t get too greedy and end up losing money.

**8-** **Not diversifying**

You should diversify even when you think you’ve found a sure thing, it simply doesn’t hurt you to have more variety. On the other hand, when you’re starting in crypto you should stick to a few crypto with good fundamentals that you clearly understand them.

**9-** **Trading**

If you’re not a professional, just stick to investing. All you have to do is buy,hodl and DCA, you will not time the market so strop trying to sell at peak prices.

**10-**  **Following trends**

“What coin is everyone talking about this week? Ok I will buy it”. Too many people just follow trends, and when their shitcoin trend is starting to lose popularity, they jump into another trend. A good investor often does not get carried away with the trend set by whales or twitter accounts.

Be honest, how many of these mistakes did you make when you started investing in crypto?

As I see it now, crypto currencies like bitcoin have several advantages over fiat currency- they can't be over printed, there is a fixed supply, and there is no central point of failure. The one disadvantage I see is the inelasticity of a crypto currency with a fixed amount in circulation. Economists regularly argue that a currency should be able to expand to meet the needs of trade. The problem is that when you have a group of people deciding when to expand it and by how much, then human error plays a role (i.e. it can be over printed beyond the legitimate needs of the economy). So why not a crypto currency that has the decentralized advantage combined with the advantages of a currency that can expand as needed? This currency, instead of being controlled by a group of people, would be controlled by an artificial intelligence which takes inputs from economic indicators and decides just how much new token should be added every year.",1635000170,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe65gs/a_best_of_both_worlds_crypto_currency/

Of course there are other coins that compete with avalanche. SOL and ALGO are pretty centralized compared to avalanche. Cardano and polkadot don’t seem to have the biggest selection of dapps as of yet (why aren’t they on Aave?)

Avalanche seems to have a bunch of extra things going for it too like how it’s easy to bridge between Ethereum and avalanche and its multiple block chains.

65,CryptoCurrency,thisiswhining,"TIL about Victor Glushkov a Soviet mathematician and cyberneticist who proposed an electronic ""moneyless system of receipts"" in 1960s","I recently learned that Soviet scientists had been working on a information network in the early 1960s, analogous to the modern internet, that was denied funding in the 1970s and therefore never materialized. The National Automated System for Computation and Information Processing (OGAS) was pioneered by Victor Glushkov. While reading a book dedciated to the topic I came across something I thought some here might find interesting.

Glushkov saw the future of soviet economy to be “incrementally organized into a cybernetically balanced network of labor, production, and consumption inputs and outputs” and therefore he saw good reason to “virtualize currency itself and make the exchange of funds take place by ""electronic receipt.""” He wanted to remove the need for a hard currency and allow all economic exchanges to take place on the OGAS network. In this original draft paper for the network system he proposed to “eliminate all paper currency, providing in its place wire­less money transfers, or a ""moneyless system of receipts"" over the OGAS network.”

*Glushkov is the on the right, sitting in the chair.*

The ""moneyless system of receipts"" sounds familiar doesn't it?
Naturally, had any such system been implemented in the Soviet Union, it would have been totally centralized, but it's still very interesting to see such early mention of a fully virtual currency. Makes one wonder what a Soviet crypto would have looked like, similar to what China might do in the coming years?

Well, they do not like the idea of decentralization, lack of control and basically because crypto **is a threat to the business of central banks.**  

But people who work in banks support us.  They are simple, regular persons just like all of us and all of them are just trying to earn some money for them and their families. 

I even have a couple of friends who work in banks and they are forbidden to trade cryptocurrencies. Well they have their own way of avoiding that rule, and they are interested in crypto as much all of us on this sub.

73,CryptoCurrency,Joubranoo,Need help for using crypto currency in a sanctioned country.,"I live in Syria, and until recently the easiest way to transfer money in and put is through Western union.
That untill today I heard they stopped operating in syria, so now the country is basically shut off from the rest of the world, the only way left is to go to Lebanon, set up a bank account, then just keep on going between the two countries, it's so much work and the banking system in Lebanon is literally falling apart.

So I thought of using crypto for exchanging money, but I still don't know how to set it up and what does it require, I don't have a Powerful PC and the internet/electricity is not stable here so I can't rely on mining, What are other options left for me?

The case is of general interest for this sub (more now that more users enter every day), so with the permission of the original creator I proceed to post the following. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Been using OKEx for some time, their spot and margin trading is great, no issues encountered so far.   
Withdrawal and deposits are also normal hence, I decided to try using their perpetual trading to leverage my position in order to maximize my profits.     

I opened a sell position worth 1 BTC at 64,000 USDT and I had a total balance of 571 USDT in my trading account at that point in time.   
Note that I only have one position opened at that point in time as well.   
Unfortunately, the price of BTC went up and boom, at 64,282.7 USDT, OKEx decided to liquidate me at a PnL ratio of -55.22%.   
This was a shock to me as the liquidation reason provided was cross margin ratio dropping lower than 100%.   
U can see clearly that my PnL is only -282.73 USDT which I should have not been liquidated in the first place and the worst part, they charged a total of 571.99 USDT to my trading account! Isn’t that daylight robbery?       
There online support is next to non-existent as they will just keep telling that they will help to escalate the case to their relevant team which is their technical department and even after 4 days, no follow up is given.   
Take this as a personal experience and even though for my case, the sum involved isn’t a lot but if u ever use OKEx, I would strongly advice to stay away from their perpetual.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/GzQ6z5r](https://imgur.com/gallery/GzQ6z5r)""

85,CryptoCurrency,dwin31,Alternative to DCA,"First things first, I've been investing in stocks for about 20 years, and crypto for about 2 years, and I firmly believe that my DCA strategy has been most successful in both areas. With that said, I've been contemplating a different approach to meet other goals.

Rather than a set amount like buying $100 ETH every week until I reach whatever goal I have, what about buying a certain amount of ETH every week instead regardless of price. So like buying 0.05 ETH every week. Just using hypothetical #s for example here. 

I get that straight up DCA is the best strategy in the long run, but wondering if having a second strategy like this has any major shortcomings? I get that extreme price movements would be a big issue, but I'm more concerned about accumulating a certain quantity in a specific time period for certain investments.

I myself was a newbie without a proper guidance , I invested lot of my money in meme and shit coins with low market cap in expections of huge gains but that didn't happen . Just a few basics Really can change the game for the new folks .

1. DCA in and DCA out - DCA means dollar cost average your money when you enter and when you leave the market , that is investing a previously thought amount of money irrespective the price of the asset. It removes your emotions and fluctuations in the price. And so if you believe in a project and know it's good in the long term , DCA is the best.




2. DYOR or Stay in top 20 ! - research low market cap projects thoroughly or to be safe you can stay in the top 20 crypto which have a good reputation like DOT LINK MATIC ALGO ETH BTC.







3. Stay away from Meme coins - You may gain some profits from them but this will ruin your discipline and Can Be vey bad in the long run ( I have a post about it already you can check it out) 






4. Buy Red Sell Green !! such a simple thing but people still struggle with it !!
People buy in Euphoria when the market is going up and sell in panic when the market is going down ... 







5. Keep (or Atleast try to keep ) your emotions out of the market  .

**10 ways for Cardano to increase its mass adoption and value in the short term.**

1. Rebrand its token from ADA to AAA in order to alywas get on top of charts (when sorted in alphabetical order).
2. Move the deadline of their updates one month later and then release the same updates one month earlier so to look like they're moving faster than expected.
3. Change the name of Charles Hoskinson into Charles Nakamotoson.
4. Ask Kim Kardashian to support any other alt-coin and cryptocurrency (then extend the request to Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan).
5. Stop referring to Cardano as the ""Ethereum Killer"", start referring to Cardano as ""Ethereum's ex wife who asked for divorce and custody of their children"".
6. Invade Poland.
7. Send a press release simply saying: ""I have something to tell you later"".
8. Change their logo into something trypophobic people wouldn't be scared of.
9. Mint those f\*cking NFTs they promised at the Cardano Summit 2021.
10. Start a collaboration with the porn industry issuing a new project called Cardanal.

96,CryptoCurrency,FOMObius,Unconventional Opinion: DYOR is generally bad advice,"We hear DYOR (Do Your Own Research) posted on here constantly, especially as advice to new investors.  The intention is good, and it’s fine insofar as it’s taken to mean 

1) Stay vigilant, be skeptical of everything you read on the internet 
2)Avoid advice from those who are financially gaining from giving advice (YouTube, Twitter)
3) A redundant way of sayings “Not financial advice”
4) Possibly applicable to scouting ultra low market cap gems
5) Obviously always check primary source materials 

That’s about where the utility of DYOR ends. I don’t Do My Own Dentistry, nor should you.  The vast majority of crypto investors, even self proclaimed veteran experts, are poorly equipped to singlehandedly do their own research. It’s a huge task for any one person to take on.  *There is tremendous power in the hive mind, and we should actively seek to leverage this* ..

As long as you avoid coin/token specific subs, the general subs like this one should be a forum for public debate and critique.  Find a source that turns out to be faulty?  Thousands of fellow crypto enthusiasts have a chance to drop links to primary sources that blow yours out of the water.  Have a prediction about how particular market forces will play out? Post it up and see if your idea can hold up to the strongest possible criticisms.

Academics across all disciplines don’t truly DYOR.  They comb through the work of others and submit research to be Peer Reviewed.  

Likewise, if you want to bleeding edge of accurate information on nearly any hobby, forums are a brutal place where all ideas are challenged. The best ideas generally survive and get something like consensus.

I’m not suggesting we drop DYOR from the CC lexicon.  But it’s important we understand the limitations. I do strongly believe that “Nobody Knows Shit About Fuck” is a literal waste of server space, a cop-out only useful for farming Moons.  Instead, let’s all spend time together, constructively researching.  Brutally critique or support ideas with primary sources.


TLDR: We learn more together than individually, and almost nobody is skilled enough to Do all of their research alone.",1634997473,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe5bv5/unconventional_opinion_dyor_is_generally_bad/

99,CryptoCurrency,ilovepussygrool,Hold on for Dear Life.,"Back in December 2020 I bought my first ever crypto because of one of my good friends. He basically shilled the hell out of XRP when it was around 20 cents and told me how valuable it was going to be. I decided to throw in a couple hundred and see where it went. 

Come February I had a few thousand in it and it was peaking around 50-60 cents. I thought to myself “there’s no way this goes higher. This is my chance to make money off of this gamble that I took.” So I sold for a small profit. I would have come close to 10xing it if I had held. 

The same goes for SOL which I bough back in January when it was a modest $12. Sold at 70 and have regretted it ever since. 

My advice is this: before you sell make sure you understand what you’re doing. I’ve always believed in taking profits but the best advice I have heard in crypto was this: “I always hear about people saying they shouldn’t have sold as early. I have never heard someone say they regret holding longer, that is if you don’t talk to a meme coin holder”

Of course I bought some crypto a few months ago but that's just 10% of the money. The rest will be invested into future tech ETF, water and green energy. 

So yesterday was the day to meet our bank manager (he's around 50 I'd say) and we started to talk about this and that. At some point we started to talk about crypto and my wife mentioned that I own some since many years. 
That was the point where this conversation took a turnaround. The bank guy was very interested in crypto and was obviously disappointed that his employer (biggest bank in my country and owner is the state) don't offer any crypto etf to his customers. He asked me a lot of questions like, where to buy without being scammed, where do I see the market in the future, what coins do I own and so on. 

We spend there 4hrs ... Of which 3 was just about crypto! Interesting was he never said one bad word about crypto, but he seemed to be curious about this space.

Secondly, my trading account had a balance of 571 USDT which u can see from my screenshot. With a sell position of 1 BTC opened at 64,000 USDT and for OKEx to liquidate me at 64,282.7 USDT is simply shocking.

I left Australia for Germany in Nov last year and have been a German tax resident since my arrival.

Confused how the double tax treaty works when it comes to my CGT gains (hoping to find guidance here from tax savvy ppl).

My understanding of how I would split my CGT liabilities is below, but hoping someone may have been through this before could verify?

I leave Australia for Germany in Nov 2020:
- I need to pay tax on any Australian gains between the start of the Australian tax year (July 1st 2020) to the date I left (Nov 2020)
-  On top of this, I need to also pay Australian exit tax on any unrealised gains on the date I leave.

Live in Germany from Nov 2020 – present
- I need to pay income tax from my arrival date on any short and long term gains. Long term gains are 0%.

Question - I am unclear how my cost basis would be calculated in Germany with a double tax treaty? Considering I will have paid exit tax in Australia, would that mean my German cost basis the same as my Australian exit tax proceeds?

If so, what does this mean for any long term gains discounts in Germany? i.e. if I bring over assets I've held for more than a year, can I still realise a 0% tax in Germany? Or.... because I have paid Australian exit tax - are these assets considered to have been ‘sold’ on the date I left Australia?

Depending on how I calculate this has a huge effect on my tax hit... any help greatly appreciated!",1634994902,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe4qed/moved_from_australia_to_germany_to_realise_crypto/

56,CryptoCurrency,TheRealJanMarsalek,The common Crypto Scams,"1. **The Dusting Attack**  
This is a scam where you will receive very tiny amounts of crypto, also known as dust, to a lot of addresses. The criminals will watch these wallets that thye've sent the dust to, to see if they can de-anonymize the wallet owner. Once they've identified the owner, they can set up more elegant phishing attempts to sweep the funds from the owner's wallets. Or, they may even physically target the owner to get them to give up the keys. Best way to protect yourself from this would be to leave the dust where it is. Do not touch it, do not interact with it in any way. And most of all, don't bother trying to sell it.
2. **The Clipboard Malware**  
This one is where your device has been infected with a malware that changes the address that you have copied and pasted from your clipboard. The malware can swap the addresses to the hacker's own address, or to a random string of characters. When that transaction goes through, you'd have lost that crypto to the hacker or just poof, thin air. To avoid this scam, make sure that your device is clean, and not infected with any kind of virus. Keep your antivirus software up to date. When you copy and paste your addresses, double, no triple check to make sure you're sending it to the right address.
3. **The Hot Lady in Your DM**  
Gentlemen, this scam is the one that targets your primal brain. A very attractive woman often dressed scantily with big boobs (sorry) may show up in your DMs asking you about crypto and try to chat you up. This eventually leads to ""her"" manipulating you into giving up your 12 word phrases or passwords. They may try to initiate exchange of nudes for crypto. They may even have a sob story and make you feel bad into sending her crypto. Best way to not fall for this, is to always remember that ""if a hot lady DMs you about crypto, ignore him"". Another variation of this is the ""send me crypto I'll double it for you."" or the ""Investor"" who thinks you're so special and wants to help you. There is no free lunch in this world. Nobody here is looking out for others by giving you free crypto (except moons of course). Personally, I avoid talking to anyone via DMs on here.
4. **The ""Helpful"" Support Team in Your DM**  
This one is where a support team ""member"" from the project DMs you via Telegram or reddit to help you validate your wallet. This is an attempt to get you to divulge your private keys, or they'll link you to a phishing site that looks legit to get you to key in your 12 word phrase. It is very common to get some attention from scammers in your DMs when you've just posted a question on a subreddit or telegram group. To protect yourself, remember not to entertain any kind of DMs from anyone. Do not click on any links, and most importantly do not give anyone your private keys.
5. **The Rugpull**  
Rugpulls happen all the time, and even billionaires have fallen victim to them. This is a scam where the developers of the smart contract, or the project drain the funds from the liquidity pool. This is especially common in De-Fi, and have been on the rise as well. The best way to not fall victim to it, is to make sure you invest in projects that have fully doxxed and trusted developers &amp; have trusted smart contracts. Of course, not everyone's gonna go through the code to make sure that the code is clean. There are third party companies that do contract auditing, such as Certik. This is where DYOR comes in. Personally I would avoid Binance Smart Chain projects altogether, cuz that's where i've experienced many rugpulls.
6. **The Honeypot**  
This is a very common scam that I've experienced quite a few times in Binance Smart Chain ""projects"". The scam is very simple. The contract is written in a way where you can buy the token, but selling will be impossible. So if you're watching the charts, and you've thrown money in there, you'll see the value rising. However, when you're ready to sell, you'll notice that you won't be able to. The best way to avoid such a scam is just to watch the transactions on BSCscanner, to make sure that buy and sell transactions are going through to unique addresses.
7. **The Attack of the Clones**  
Another kind of phishing attack, where you might get an seemingly legit looking email from an exchange, with a link contained within the email, or clicking on links from untrusted sources. These links may lead to websites that look like the carbon copy of the original website. There might be a security notification telling you to key in your seed phrase. When you do key it in, the hackers will own your crypto, and can simply sweep your wallet clean. To avoid this, you should double check the url of the site you're using, as they often look dodgy, with a .org or a .net extension. For instance you may click on a link that takes you to ""pomhub.com"" instead of the actual site. To protect yourself, bookmark the actual links to the exchanges, instead of clicking random links.
8. **Pump and Dump**  
There are many telegram groups that organize planned pumps and dumps, hoping that others will FOMO in and buy in. Once the price has pumped, the people who are in on it will dump their positions, causing significant loss to the ones who had FOMO'd in. Often times, the owners of the project may be in on it, and may even pay influencers to shill the project. When the coin has pumped enough, they will just dump their positions and pocket the profits. To avoid this, just don't FOMO into projects. Don't listen to some influencer with 1 hit song back in 2013 to make financial decisions.

Back at that time I was living in one of the poorest countries of the world, Argentina, and during the bull run a friend told me that he was making money with B.T.C. 

I had heard about B.T.C. but it never had caught my attention. I thought it was something strange and unaccessible from the dark Web. 

Then I asked my friend how was he buying B.T.C. and he took added me to a Facebook page. 

I found out about an exchange but it had fees, and to me in a poor country, fees are important. So I wanted to avoid that. 

In the Facebook page there were people buying and selling B.T.C. through references and bank transferences. 

I created my wallet with some help and made my first purchase, and number was going up. I bought a small amount when B.T.C.=3kUSD. ""Exciting"" I thought, ""number goes up"". 

Another guy selling, with reference, I was buying. Second purchase. 

I want to remark that the way of buying was: someone posting ""I sell x amount, I need x amount of $"" I contacted them through private messaging, then they used to tell me the bank account details, and I used to leave my room, my house (usually at night), walk 800m to the closest ATM because I couldn't make bank transference though my computer, and transfer the money. Also send a picture of the receipt. 

Now, there was this scammer who was selling 0.2 B.T.C. cheap. I did the procedure. And then he told me that he didn't get the money. Then I slowed down and check his Facebook profile (only 2 photos) d@mn! His bank account with a name different from his Facebook account. I was confident because of the first transactions but this one... I felt nauseous, my savings... Ok, thought chat I kept calm and even though I had a feeling that he was a scammer I pretended that I was working out a solution and made up that my ""uncle"" (made up) worked in the bank and I was about to talk to him to ask me about why he didn't get the transaction. Maybe he felt scared of going to jail or something so in the end he transferred me the B.T.C. 

Days later another person was posting that he scammed him. 

Doing this I managed to buy around 0.42 B.T.C. 

Unfortunately I was noob and sold in a peer to peer transaction it when I was worth 1 B.T.C.=7900USD. I was happy with doubling my savings. 

Back at that time I've only bought P2P.

87,CryptoCurrency,theycallmelopez,Man arrested in France for hiding 2M€ in assets in cryptocurrency from the fiscal authorities.,"TLDR; Man facing years in federal prison for not declaring his gains to the fiscal authories in France after he received a speed ticket in a Lambo. - Always fill in your taxes unless you are part of the ""1%"".

A man in France is under arrest because he was hiding assets in cryptocurrency from the fiscal authorities. 

After a speed ticket was given to him for riding too fast with a Lambo, police launched an investigation and it appeared that the individual's lifestyle didn't match the declared revenus/assets. 

His explanation is that the speed at which he was gaining those assets didn't give him enough time to declare the gains to the authorities and also the lack of knowledge on how to declare them has prevented him from doing so too. Obviously, the judge didn't buy the excuse, thus a fraud investigation was launched.

At the 1 bedroom appartment of this man, they found the following items;

- 10 gold ingots (1kg/ingot)
- 250 pure gold and silver coins (value ~500k€)
- 1.5M€ in crypto assets in his cold wallets on the computer.

It is also discovered that he made several trips abroad to sell the gold and silver he had in his possession. It is the way he chose to convert crypto to fiat. Thus adding a money laundering charge into the case.

This happened this week, no updates have been done in regards to this matter as investigation is still ongoing.

Moral of the story, ALWAYS declare your gains unless you're part of the 1%. We clearly don't have the same rights, and unless things change, it is what it is, don't risk years in prison after all the efforts you've done in crypto.

93,CryptoCurrency,XxLetsgetrichxX,Newcomers beware.,"

Everyone needs to read this, stay safe out there it is a dangerous place to be if you haven't put the research work in.

If you are in this group and you are a begginer I really want you to consider this when you are investing. 

I don’t consider myself a skilled developer and in fact I know very little, to nothing, about coding. When it come to being technical, I'm the guy who refers you to my buddy lol.

Now, I've been trying to dig more into the tech behind crypto and found a lot of things  confusing, but, all technology aside, I was curious as to what creating and launching a coin really ment.

Fact is, after 1 google search and 20 minutes, I could transfer $100 to a ETH wallet and create a coin with a 50 million supply with a few clicks and copy and paste.

The entire thing took less than an hour.

Let’s say today I created a coin with a 50 trillion supply and sent 25 trillion to someone else. 

Now I really want everyone to think about the fact that a person with no real technical understanding could create a coin in under an hour. I'm sure everyone in this group probably could too after watching a few tutorial. 

For an extra $50 I could put up a website and another 10k on a copywriter, I could easily launch an ico and sell a shit ton of these useless tokens promising things that don't even exist.

Its actually pretty easy to get listed on exchanged and coin market cap if you create enough hype and trading volume around your coin as well. Just meet their criteria and apply.

This is what 90% of the stuff in crypto is, nothing more than a coin that took 20 minutes to make and $100. I want everyone new in this group to realize that 99% of the promises that cryptocurrency and blockchain projects have are in things that do not exist and tech that hasn't even been developed yet.

This is why all this is so exciting but also so scary.

Before you invest in a coin do you ask who are the developers on a project? What funding do they have? Do they even have a working platform? If not, What's the application they are working for and what are their benchmarks? Is the coin actually used to power the tech or is it just a ""coin"" that has no real function?

The reason why people spend hours really digging into these coins and the projects behind them is because it's extremely important to understand the REAL risk.

Anyone can create a coin in 1 hour put up a website in an a day, and have a ico promising pipe dreams ready to launch in a week, in a world with no rules or regulations. 

There are just over 13000 different crypto currency’s,(based on Coinmarketcap) how many of these do you think offer actual use cases? How many do you think are a scam? My guess is probably about 90%

Just want to make sure everyone is safe. Do your research and never invest in something yo do not 100% understand.

You can read more about it in my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qc9zoe/finally_did_it_i_made_a_crypto_trading_bot_that/). 

In a nutshell I created a crypto trading algorithm that can scans the Binance announcement page, and when Binance announces that they will  be listing a new coin, the bot will automatically place a buy order on Gate. io. 

I've observed that coins shoot  up when Binance announces that they will list them, and people rush to buy it on other exchanges in anticipation of the listing - creating a snowball effect. The crypto trading bot aims to take advantage of that and ride this spike that can sometimes reach 10x.

Manually trading it would be impossible, so a tool is needed to act quickly.

So many of you got involved with the project that we now have a growing community of 750 programmers and crypto enthusiasts all working to improve the original tool!

As I didn't knew much of it I went on Google and searched to find stuff about them. And Oh boy did I miss those Red Flags. They had a system where you get 60% of your investment every 60 days. So if you invest $500 you get $300 bucks every 60 days. If you recruit others into the ""company"" you'd get your money earlier than after 60 days. If you invest more you'd obviously get bigger gains.

To be honest: I was curious. So the Work-Colleague did set up a profile for me. In the meanwhile I bought my first ever Crypto and ""prepared"" myself to invest about $2000 into Masbitcoin. But in the end something in my head said: go for the smallest investment and I listened to myself and ""only"" invested $250 into Masbitcoin. All the other coworkers took way way bigger investments like $2000. 

So after investing I saw in the pyramid that my Co-Worker placed me above all other Co-Workers. Per Person which gets placed beneath you you'll get the money 3 days earlier so after 45 days I really got 60% percent of my investment back ($150). Now all the other Co-Workers realized that this ""works"" and started to invest even more. 

Skip forward 60 days. I should get my next payment by now. I never wanted to ask others to invest as I don't like to give financial advice to others. And oh wonder: We all didn't get paid.

The homepage was down. All numbers were blocked and you had no way to get into connection with Masbitcoin.

I learned my lesson with a loss of $100. Luckily the BTC prize increased and the amount of BTC I still had in my wallet easily covered my loss.

My Co-Workers lost it all as they didn't own Crypto next to their investment into Masbitcoin.

This was the last thing I ever heard about Masbitcoin: [https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/masbitcoin-ceo-jorge-sanchezs-bodyguards-gunned-down-in-mexico/](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/masbitcoin-ceo-jorge-sanchezs-bodyguards-gunned-down-in-mexico/)

34,CryptoCurrency,vonvinvoo,Ledger live Polkadot interface outage,"As we are all aware ledgers UI stopped working for DOT around 13 days ago for me, and I grew tired of not seeing my staking rewards.

Knew from the announcements they were working on it so thought I’d just wait and hope something changes soon. Noticed firmware 2.0 was available, also connected my Nano x to my ledger live on desktop and noticed it is actually displaying all of my rewards for past 13 dates and the relevant updated actual amount of DOT.

I completed update 2.0 hoping it would update my dot like my desktop live. After completing update it still showed the amount of DOT before UI stopped working. 

So I deleted the DOT account to re-add it hoping it would sync and update, but when I try to add the account it fails at the 3 of 3 synchronisation stage, with the error message;

Cannot convert metadata from version 14 to 13.

Is anyone else having this issue, does anybody know a work around? Because now my ledger portfolio is missing my DOT holdings entirely, and it’s killing me wish I never deleted the account.

35,CryptoCurrency,cheeseburger_daddy,CoinMarketCap data breach - over 3 million email addresses have been leaked.,"Seems like CMC has been breached and over 3 million email addresses stolen, so make sure to check haveibeenpwned.com to see if your email address was part of the breach. 

[See this tweet.](https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/1451650181552750594?s=21)

My email was part of it, so I’m spending my Saturday changing passwords and email addresses. You should too if it was part of the leak. 

Especially if you use that email for exchange accounts, you should remove it asap and use another one. Expect a lot of spam and crypto scam emails heading your way too. 

The following statement has been given by CMC: *“CoinMarketCap has become aware that batches of data have shown up online purporting to be a list of user accounts. While the data lists we have seen are only email addresses (no passwords), we have found a correlation with our subscriber base.”*

This is also another reminder to **never** recycle passwords, especially when it comes to your crypto. My Reddit account was frozen yesterday as well because of “suspicious activity” and I was prompted to change my password to unfreeze it. If there is a correlation to my email being leaked or not, I cannot know, but especially with vaults on Reddit your accounts become increasingly valuable.

36,CryptoCurrency,Prab1472,Some of the worst crypto mistake a beginner may make,"Using Leverage without its knowledge. Just so you can utilize leverage on a centralized exchange like Binance, you need to use leverage correctly. 

The reason is that you're using borrowed money to trade with someone else's money, in this case the exchanges money, and you're taking on increased risk in order to use that money. For example, if the market moves 10% in your favor, you make 10x gains using 10x leverage, but if the market moves 10% in the opposite direction, you make 10x losses.

&amp;#x200B;

Another is, Following the herd (fomo) is a mistake I see a lot of people make. What does it mean? It means buying too late and entering after the move has happened. Let's take cardano as an example. We had a pump because of a herd of smart contracts and buying on the way up in fear of missing out fomo. By the time you've bought in, it's retraced and you're at a loss.

If you lost out on the news piece of any project, and you missed out on its pump, you're too late. If you're looking for an entry point, you're better off waiting for a retrace and entering there.",1634990691,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe3mq7/some_of_the_worst_crypto_mistake_a_beginner_may/
37,CryptoCurrency,robotmole,How many do we need?,"So we know that the future will encompass a variety of coins and chains that fill different roles. There is no need for one to try and tackle every use case and be solely responsible for all financial applications.

This is pretty well agreed and why we all diversify happily. But the question then becomes, if we don't just need 1 chain, how many do we actually need for a thriving connected ecosystem that handles all roles and ideas.

It seems like every day a new promising project pops up that claims in its summaries to do basically what others are doing but a little better or with a different buzzword.

So ultimately most of these will never get the success they would've had they come a year or two earlier because the first horses out the gate have already filled their niche to bursting.

My question is what are the main chains we need for all uses and how many?

For example:

Secure value store with stability: Btc
Smart contracts: Eth
Oracle: Link
Ecosystem connecting: Atom
Stable coin: Luna/terraUSD
Cross border rapid payments: XLM

There was a post about Worldcoin will collect your biometrics to issue free coins.
Basically pointing towards that they will give free Crypto coins in return for your biometrics.

The idea of giving free crypto is not new, Stellar(XLM) was the first one to came up with the idea to give free Crypto via Facebook profiles but after finding out people have multiple facebook accounts they dropped the idea.

So this time Worldcoin came up with the idea to give free Crypto with the purpose of Crypto mass adoption,it is completely willing participation.
The iris of a person's eye will be scanned to issue free share.,no other detail is required.
The idea behind collecting biometrics(iris scan)  is to make sure nobody gets double share of free coins(as per their website) 

Isn't this a great idea to bring more people to Crypto. Isn't what we want?  More adoption !
Or Do we have something else to do for mass adoption?  Or wait until one by one people coming in Crypto space their own just like you and me?  

And about privacy Social Media platforms are already making billions by selling our privacy
So what is wrong if we get some bucks for giving out the same thing which Facebook sell almost everyday and we ourselves normally put into various websites on internet? 

Honestly, tell me what they can possibly do with the iris scan? I really don't have any idea,teach me about it.,seriously.",1634990015,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe3gt2/worldcoins_idea_of_giving_free_coins_for_mass/
49,CryptoCurrency,Vgta-Bst,I have come up with a new strategy.,"This new strategy is about trying to stop checking my portfolio hundreds of times a day. 

A few weeks ago, this was my morning routine. 
- Wake up, shut off my alarm and grab my phone.
 
- Check FB to get rid off stupid birthday notifications. 

- Check RH (I still have it bc of AMC)

- Check my crypto portfolio. 

- Check reddit and kill time until I'm ready to get out of bed. 

And throughout the day I would check mt portfolio every chance I get. Until I discover something. When I wake up and check reddit, if I don't see the crypto subs posting about new ATHs or hyping coins or news about this or that and check my portfolio, it is flat. Barely any movement. But if the opposite happens where the crypto subs are trending and all that and check my folio, it is up quiet a bit. 

So pretty much I stopped checking my portfolio on days where reddit and the crypto subs are dead. And only check it when everyone is talking about possible rockets and shit like that.",1634989994,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe3gme/i_have_come_up_with_a_new_strategy/

I think we are all in a good position currently to have some good returns in coming months. But what is the way to become wealthier and remain wealthy?

In general the best way to handle your financial situation is so easy you may overlook it's simplicity :

*Spend less than you earn.*


That's all there's to it. Try living on less expenses than strictly needed. Drive a little older car, choose the less expensive cell phone, try to think what clothes you buy and need, spend less on groceries.

When doing so consistently you can start saving money. The money you can use to pay debts and start investing. Investing means diversifying in crypto and stocks for example. Don't bet your life savings on 1 crypto coin.

Of course I could buy more ETH via coinbase and then send it to my wallet for swapping on a DEX. 
But due to the first in first out rule my „older“ ETH in my wallet, which has gained profit since I acquired it, would be regarded as „sold with profit“ if I use it for a swap to another coin.

Not just with noob crypto adopters, but also with more and more industry and venture capital money pouring into the market.

The ever-growing amount can often overwhelm not only noobs, but also those who have been in the game for awhile. I know that I occasionally have anxiety over whether I am doing enough research &amp; due diligence on all these coins - old and new.

I definitely learn better in that sort of environment but I’m not sure if there are any courses which Can be signed up to or recommended. 

Any help in this department would be greatly appreciated - I also have no idea how much this would cost either.

63,CryptoCurrency,Salibih,I'm scared to post this here: I want your opinion on a coin (No shilling and no bashing please)," 

I have to give some **background information** as I want to avoid the general bashing and shilling comments that usually come with such questions therefore I have to explain the following first:

I used this sub a lot to get a better understanding of certain things when it comes to crypto in general some examples are:

\- How do CEXs works (liquidity providing, pricing etc.)  
\- How does staking work (PoF)  
\- How does wallet encryption work?  
\- How to securely use crypto (store on CEX, different wallet types, security measures etc.)  
\- and many many more

So what I want to point out is I got very good information when it came to talking about general topics but I also noticed that talking about a certain project usually leads to only two types of answers:

1. People that simply shill coins not including any reasons why something is good.
2. People that simply bash coins calling it a scam or even gettin personal telling OPs to stop shilling their shit coin etc. without doing research about it and give an informed opinion and reasoning behind their bashing.

What I want to ask **this community is about their opinion on a certain small cap token** which I came across due to a fork (I had the old token and they opened a Swap window to swap the old ones for the new one. The first project was a failure but some of the core team members sticked to the belive that the idea was great and relaunched everything learning from their mistakes - at least that's what they communicate).

I read their whitepaper, checked their website, asked questions in their TG chat and decided to go for the swap. Now I'm thinking of investing a little more into their project because I like what they want to achieve but I also know that when it comes to crypte your project's idea can be the best on earth if people do not like it will fail.

**Why do I want your opinion on this specific project if I already did my research and came to the conclusion to like it?**

1. I like their idea/vision - but that does not mean that others will like it too and that's what it is about.
2. I did my research - but that does not mean that my research was well. After all I'm not a professional but simply a guy that loves crypto and is looking for different projects to put a little money in, hoping to get something back.
3. I can not know all the other crypto projects and therefore it's unclear to me if this project does something which has not yet been done by others (or at least they do it better than others which have the same goals).

**Now coming to the token itself:**

I'm talking about Pawhtereum, an ERC-20 token which goes into the charity-token area of Crypto (and I know there have been lot's of scams around this topic in the past). They just recently burned some tokens (left overs of the swap - meaning people that did not swap the old one to the new one) and have currenltly a total supply of 860mio tokens. There will be no more burns in the future (at least not from the dev team). Their tokenomics can be found in there whitepaper (see link below). 2% of every transaction is being assigned to a publicly known charity wallet from where they donate money to cat shelters - the community can decide how, when and to whom it is being provided. They already gave 82'000$ in charity to cat shelters and currently the charity wallet has more than 10'000$ ready for the next donation. Besides the 2% fee which goes into the charity wallet another 2% are being split between all holders depending on their stake. I like this because there is some real benefit from this crypto to the real world. People can speculate with it but with every transaction there is a little amount used for donation purposes.

Website: [https://pawthereum.com/](https://pawthereum.com/)  
Coinmarketcap: [https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/pawthereum/](https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/pawthereum/)  
Whitepaper: [https://pawthereum.com/shared-files/2097/?Pawpaper.pdf](https://pawthereum.com/shared-files/2097/?Pawpaper.pdf)

**Now coming to the bad points I see:**

1. For charity the tokens in the charity wallet need to be sold (even if they accept pawth in the beginning they will have to sell it for fiat to use the donation)
2. The coin needs more exposure and more market places to 1. compensate the charity sells by having enough buyers and 2. create more volume to even get larger donations which should lead to a larger exposure and more people hearing from it.
3. The new token was launched not even two weeks ago and already donated 10'000$ having another 10'000$+ left in the charity the other 62'000$ were part of the old token from what I understood. -&gt; People may want to see larger amounts to be absolutly sure that they will not simply steal the charity wallet but I think that's a trust question and something everyone has to answer him/herself personally.

For me it sounds good. It's also related to pets like all the large meme.coins but in this case it has a real life use case and actually helps pets - that's greate in my opinion.

Still I want the opinion/inputs of people that did not hear of this token before (Telegram is a place where only belivers are and that's not really good to have a critical opinion on something) so I can include those points to take a finale decision on investing more into it.

Thank you all in advance!

54,CryptoCurrency,Wilmotac,"If you wanted to use a reserve currency, would you use Bitcoin or the USD?","The Dollar has a lot of influence, making nearly 60% of the world's official foreign exchange reserves. More than that, it's used as a safe-haven currency in countries with unstable local currencies, and even other countries aim to accumulate USD. 

We've all seen posts labelling the USD a shitcoin, citing its inflation, centralisation, and distribution, but for just a second, imagine you were the leader of some Central American state. Would you want to amass reserves in a currency controlled by a foreign - and often hostile - power? Would you want to amass reserves in a currency that is being devalued at record speed? Bitcoin presents an alternative that only becomes more powerful as it sees widespread acceptance. 

Yes, Bitcoin is volatile, but even taking buying the top and selling the bottom, it holds its value better than a handful of national currencies. The volatility that so characterises Bitcoin is dissipating. Besides, would you rather hold reserves in a currency that is volatile, or a currency rapidly trending downwards?

Long term, the real flippening isn't BTC overtaking gold, but BTC overtaking the USD as a reserve currency. 7 trillion of FX reserves are USD, and that's not even accounting for the unofficial day to day use of the dollar.",1634978574,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe12om/if_you_wanted_to_use_a_reserve_currency_would_you/
55,CryptoCurrency,aacid,Bitcoin vs environment,"I can't help myself thinking about this again and again... Whole world is riding the ecofriendly wave. Countries all over the world planning to ban diesel engines, heavily investing into electric cars,boosting recycling efforts, developing ecologic alternatives to plastic and so much more.

David Attenborough (and many other scientist and activists) pleading to start thinking more about the future of the planet otherwise our grandchildren will problably have some tough times...

But when it comes to Bitcoin, no one cares. Bitcoin is the future, digital gold, economic savior... Does it really do not bother you that mining bitcoin wastes more energy than a smaller country? And for what? So some people can make money of off it? How is that different than deliberately not recycling or polluting?

The worst about it IMO is that we have alternatives. It's not like we either waste energy using bitcoin or nothing. There are thousands of other cryptocurrencies that don't need Proof of Work.

trillion archangel tokens were transferred out of my metamask wallet on my
phone. I didn't not authorize this transaction. I tracked the transaction on
etherscan.com the transaction was for 35T of my tokens with about 670 billion
sent to a tax wallet for the token and another 670 billion sent to the burn wallet.
The hacker recieved 33 trillion of my tokens after ""tax"". I was able to view this persons
wallet on etherscan.com and I was able to see my crypto sitting in his wallet. The
full amount sat there for maybe 10 minutes before being swapped into Wrapped
Ethereum. I can see the different swaps and transfers to different wallets. My
crypto community and I were able to track all the way to the final withdraw to a
regulated centralize crypto exchange in Europe. These transaction were
""addressed"" to a wallet owned by the hacker and offered by Binance. Binance is
a cryptocurrency exchange which is currently the largest exchange in the world
in terms of daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies.
Binance is the final destination for people wanting to turn their crypto into

I have put some money into btc/eth/ada/shib/doge and Dot but this is purely out of hype/things ive seen in this subreddit, ive tried searching ways to actually get started/reasearch any new and upcoming coins or get more info on how this works but to no avail.

And unfortunately its not the good kind of youtubers like Guy from CoinBureau or Ben Cowen, you know people who actually do research and know their shit. 

Nah, those were too boring for my man so he went right to the shit tier of youtubers who call themselves anaylsts. Those Youtubers are straight out pump and dumpers who buy their coin pre-pump and then start shilling it. And when the dump beings they start claiming that its just a dip and buy the dip or dont trust the fud. Then there is those stupid thumbnails, x1000 and :o faces

If you are a newbie those people will promise you insane gains, 24/7 bull run all year round, no losses just gains, better put money in ASAP and shit like that. Many of these youtubers play the drama card. Drama and scandals always sell. So when the market dips they go full drama ""OH GOD NO DIPPING SO HARD"" or "" TOLD YOU TO SELL"" , ""LAST CHANCE TO GET RICH"", ""BUY THIS BEFORE 1000000x"" and so on

If you are someone who just started getting into crypto...I would highly advise you to stay away from such people and just go with some high quality channels which I'm going to list:

***- Coin Bureau (ignore the stupid face he does on thumbnail, he has good content)***

***- Benjamin Cowen (very analitical, very knowledgable guy)***

***- JRNY Crypto***

***- Invest Answers***

&amp;#x200B;

These channels are absolute top tier. Trust me.

Many of the newbies only see their investment and they want it to go up and only up. Most of them are not yet used or understand the market fluctuations. Hell even I dont know half of the time why it dips or rises and ive been here for a while. At least not until new start coming in.

Newbies, don't get hooked with those low level youtube channels who want your money or just turn like the wind does. They will screw you up in most cases.

77,CryptoCurrency,zorko86,It took me 6 months to understand the technology and true value of bitcoin and blockchain. How to pass this knowledge on,"We’re all busy in our dailiy lives, read full time job, kids etc. I knew about bitcoin for years - tried to mine it several years ago but this project got burried due to the kiddos and my job.

Anyhow. I started investing some money into crypto end of last year. Like every starter I expected it would go up forever. Went through the panic selling phase to the hodling, then the may crash happened - where I sold in profit. 

I took this time to do more research on various crypto projects. Reinvested in some coins and mining equipment (antminers, HNT miners) to understand the hardware part of some blockchains. 

By doing this, and a lot of reading, I now truly understand the power of decentralisation and bitcoin, it’s cycles and price action. 

Still difficult to pass everything I understand to someone else as everyone seems to be programmed to stick with the system where they trust banks, state issued currencies and their time for money trading mindset. 

Sometimes I think it is better to not talk about it as most of the people pretend to get it, but on the next day they admit still not understanding fuck about shit.

84,CryptoCurrency,Jeronemoo,Which questions do you ask yourself about a project before investing?,"Personally I'm only invested in projects that solve a real world problem, add value to the usecase, have a product and are already adopted by the general public. My personal questions are therefore all about what the project does and if I think it can stand the test of time;

1.  **What is it, what usecase does it do?** A clear simple elevator pitch should be possible.
2. **What real world problem does it solve?** If it doesn't solve a problem, why would anyone use this over existing solutions?
3. **Is blockchain really needed to solve that problem?** If it isn't, why would someone chose this over non-blockchain solutions? Chances are, this project is just building on hype.
4. **Do they have a product?** If they don't, you'd just be investing in, oftentimes empty, promises.
5. **Is the product usable by the general non tech-savvy (i.e. your grandma) public?** If it's not (i.e. needing to know how to operate a wallet), chances are it will never reach mass adoption.
6. **What is their current adoption?** Adoption is a verification that the product is desired, no adoption (yet) is a risk.

If a crypto project answers these questions positively and I like the usecase and approach, then I'm fairly confident the project will do good in the longterm, therefore I invest in them.

So yeah; **Before you decide to invest in a crypto coin, what are the questions you ask yourself about it to decide whether or not the crypto coin / project is a good one?**",1634976366,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe0n24/which_questions_do_you_ask_yourself_about_a/

95,CryptoCurrency,Ithinkwereparkedman,"Unpopular opinion, maybe: Ethereum has become a store of value like Bitcoin","Hear me out my fellow magic internet money lovers.

Eth is now a store of value whether you've realised or not. 

Deflationary -&gt; Supply reducing, applying upward pressure to prices. Who wants to sell when they know the asset is slowly running out and no doubt becoming more valuable over time? The answer will be very few.

Stupid fees -&gt; Only people with a lot of Eth can use the network as per the stupidly high fees - currently the network serves the rich only.

Some institutional investors finding Eth more attractive than bitcoin -&gt; They sense the same thing. A store of value rather than a useful network.

Maybe things will change with eth 2.0 but there's a lot to fix if Eth is to become useable day in and day out for transactions for the little people.

Until then it's a store of value. And now it's at this stage I don't think it will ever change in the piblics perception. There are already too many useable, alternatives to Eth that I'm not sure the crypto crowd will be too interested in pushing Eth back to being utilised.

Infact it probably suits the crypto crowd for it to remain a store of value.

Maybe it becomes less of a store of value during a bear market but my gut instinct tells me we're too far gone.

Conclusion: Hodl your Eth. Don't burn it up in transactions or anything else. Long term it's the play to make as a store of value alongside bitcoin.",1634975851,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qe0j20/unpopular_opinion_maybe_ethereum_has_become_a/

I checked in a month later and it was slightly ahead of where I was at the time. Fast forward pumptober and I've managed to beat what I would have had by about 200%

15,CryptoCurrency,northwesternsamurai,Everything you need to know about BLOKTOPIA (BLOK) and why it will change crypto forever.,"This is due diligence on something I believe in. I hold a few low cap gems in my portfolio alongside ETH ADA DOT and this is my biggest bet. Here’s why. 

THE FUTURE OF CRYPTO

The metaverse industry is estimated to become an $815 billion industry by 2025. Facebook is even rebranding around its pivot to the metaverse world. A combination of crypto, NFTs, VR, and gaming, and community is the future of blockchain technology. Investing into anything NFT metaverse gaming related right now is like being on the ground floor within the ground floor of crypto. 

WHAT IS BLOKTOPIA? 

“Bloktopia is a Skyscraper made up of 21 levels to pay recognition to 21 million Bitcoin. Token holders will be known as Bloktopians. It will act as a central hub and welcome all levels of crypto experience. For the first time ever, users will have access to crypto information and immersive content all in one place. Bloktopians will be able to earn revenue through real estate ownership, advertising revenue, play games, build networks and much more. By using the world’s most advanced real time 3D Creation Engine, Bloktopia will leverage this technology to create stunning visualisations and user experience.”

Basically a giant metaverse space with 21 floors where people can come together and interact about everything crypto. 

WHAT CAN YOU DO IN BLOKTOPIA?

This is summarized in four words.

LEARN
You can learn about crypto through virtual events, seminars, keynotes, connecting with other users, virtual educational learning tools, and project sponsored events- all within the metaverse with other people. They built a virtual auditorium in one of the floors for projects to host virtual keynotes! There is also talk of virtual watch parties for sports and news events. 

EARN
Projects can earn revenue through advertisement revenue through totems and spaces etc in BLOKTOPIA giving exposure to 300+ million users worldwide. If you watch the teaser video currently some of these are Polygon, Avalanche, Binance, BitBoy, Jake Paul…etc. Really interesting concept with some big names already. Users can also generate revenue by buying and selling virtual real estate through what they call REBLOK. Pretty neat. Influencers and projects can also have their own virtual stores where they sell things like NFTs! Looks like BitBoy and Jake Paul already secured a spot. So did Travala.com! 

You can earn passive income as well through staking BLOK although I believe for now the staking pools are full. 

PLAY
This is exciting. Users can play virtual games together to earn crypto and prizes. Virtual gaming is already blowing up and I have no doubt this feature is going to absolutely draw more people to connect virtually and play to earn. This is a great way to social network as well. There are contests and a virtual prize wheel you can spin everyday and even a Lamborghini drawing where you can win an actual lambo delivered to your door. 

CREATE
This is the one I understand the least. Here is the quote from their website. 

“Create scenes, artworks, challenges and more, using the simple builder tool, then take part in events to win prizes. For more experienced creators, the SDK provides the tools to fill the world with social games and applications.”

Basically, BLOKTOPIA mission is to become the central hub for crypto. Think this subreddit turned into a virtual metaverse where you can do literally everything. 

PARTNERS

They have some stacked partnerships. BLOKTOPIA is built on Polygon but they recently announced partnerships with Travala.com and Avalanche. Their whitepaper also list Coinbase as a potential virtual leaser. What’s interesting is that Avalanche’s logo was displayed on their teaser video a few weeks ago but the partnership was only announced today. Going by that logic if you watch the teaser video again Binance is freaking everywhere…what could that mean? Is a listing on the horizon? Check out this tweet as well. 

[Tweet](https://twitter.com/binancefutures/status/1451397903558356999?s=21)

[Teaser Trailer](https://youtu.be/znnccRunCzI)

TEAM 

The team looks strong with a ton of high level experience in their fields but the person I’m interested in is their CTO a man named Simon Benson. Before this he was the director of Immersive Experience for Sony with over 25 years experience in his field.

TOKENOMICS

Circulating supply: 2,040,000,000
Maximum supply: 200,000,000,000
Key metrics: Team holds 15%, treasury holds 33%, staking wallet holds 25%, advisors hold 7%. Rest is early adopters, seed and private rounds, public sale, and exchanges. 

Now the best news. BLOK is DEFLATIONARY! Tokens used for land sales and real estate are BURNED to reduce the supply. Love it. 

BLOK listed on KuCoin two weeks ago at .0002 cents and is currently sitting at about .03 (15,000% gain…crazy) for a market cap of just, that’s right, $62 million 😂

To put that into perspective if BLOKTOPIA had the market cap of Decentraland’s ATH it would put BLOK at .83! Now with all these partnerships being announced, groundbreaking in-world features, and likely Binance listing on the horizon…is this really that out of reach this cycle?

The closer that prediction proves true, the better off your investment choices could be. I'd love to hear feedback and alternate perspectives. 

Overall, I don't perceive much change a year from now, especially in the top 3, but a few others have the potential to swap positions. Here is a summary of the highlights:

* Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance will maintain their positions. 
* Meme coins like Doge and Shib will drop out.
* Solana and Polkadot enter the top5 with significantly increased adoption.
* Ripple and Cardano consolidate in the top ten, but drop a few points.
* Tether slips, with Polygon and Vechain entering the top ten as international adoption increases.

Then the hackers proceed to promote certain projects and fake deals. For example, viewers are called to participate in so-called giveaways through a payment, but of course such giveaways always turn out to be fake and there is always a scam.

Sometimes the hacked accounts are also sold instead of being repurposed by the hackers. According to Google, such accounts would be sold for several thousand dollars on a black market.

Google indicates that they are on the trail of the perpetrators of the malfeasance on YouTube. It is said to be a group of hackers from Russia. The group contacts potential victims with lucrative business deals in order to then take away their YouTube account in an illegal way.

31,CryptoCurrency,RefugeeDutch_Syrian,Walmart installs thousands of bitcoin ATMs,"The US supermarket chain has launched a pilot of bitcoin ATMs. Initially, 200 machines will be installed, but the plan is to add 8,000 more.

News outlet Bloomberg writes that Walmart is working with manufacturer Coinstar and crypto-broker CoinMe. The [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/walmart-shoppers-can-now-buy-bitcoin-at-200-kiosks-in-its-stores) does not provide a clear timeline of when the collaboration will start or within what timeframe these ATMs will be installed.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it is great for adoption but 11% is too freaking much. With 2.3 million employees, it is one of the largest private employers in the world. It is also the largest retail group in the world. Walmart U.S. has over 4,700 stores in the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

**How it works?**

Customers can use the bitcoin ATM by entering a banknote, they will receive a paper voucher with a redemption code for this purpose. To redeem the code, customers must create a Coinme account and register as a customer. Thus, it is not the intention to deposit money anonymously for bitcoin.

In addition, customers cannot withdraw their bitcoin from their account, the article also does not say if there are any plans for this in the future. To use this service, there is an 11% surcharge (yikes). To illustrate, at BLOX and BTC Direct it costs 1% to exchange your euros for bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet they're also talking about Bitcoin, Eth, ADA

Bitcoin has a market cap of $1 trillion
Ethereum $500 billion (rounded for simplicity)
Cardano $70 billion 

So are people seriously expecting in a few short years Bitcoin can have a market cap of $100 trillion. That would put Bitcoin equal to the market cap of EVERY publicly traded stock in the world

Ethereum at $50 trillion is about the value of the total US bond market.

Cardano at $7 trillion would have the same value as roughly half of all goods and services produced in China. Or about $2 trillion more than all the goods and services produced in Japan.

Maybe things can reach these values but it might take 20-30 years to get there.

If people want to make picks they think will 100x it seems like you gotta be looking at things with a market cap with about $100 million. That only needs to grow to $10 billion to get a 100x. That actually might be really feasible if you select the right project. But no one is talking about their lambos coming from anything with a $100mln market cap.

https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/myopic-loss-aversion/

""Myopic loss aversion occurs when investors take a view of their investments that is strongly focused on the short term, leading them to react too negatively to recent losses, which may be at the expense of long-term benefits (Thaler et al., 1997). This phenomenon is influenced by narrow framing, which is the result of investors considering specific investments (e.g. an individual stock or a trade) without taking into account the bigger picture (e.g. a portfolio as a whole or a sequence of trades over time) (Kahneman &amp; Lovallo, 1993). A large-scale field experiment has shown that individuals who receive information about investment performance too frequently tend to underinvest in riskier assets, losing out on the potential for better long-term gains (Larson et al., 2016).""

More here:

http://www.behavioraleconomics.com/myopic-loss-aversion-a-behavioral-answer-to-the-equity-premium-puzzle/

Here’s where our experiment comes in. Partnering with the technology trading firm Normann, we used a beta test of a trading platform to see how access to price information affected professional investors’ willingness to take on risk, and their ultimate profits. We broke the investors up into two groups: a frequent information group with access to second-by-second changes in price and portfolio value, and an infrequent information group that could only see these changes every four hours. Both groups traded the same mutual fund-like instrument, so both groups received the same price realization, despite different frequencies of being able to view that realization.  Importantly, the investors did not know that they were being experimented on and the stakes of the trading were high.

The results are striking, and align well with the MLA theory. Over the 14-day experiment, the MLA effect took time to arise, but by the last two days of the experiment the results were clear. The key finding is that investors with infrequent price information invest around 33% more in risky assets than investors with frequent information do. What’s more, those with infrequent information earned 53% higher profits than those with frequent information did. And these results are consistent across all levels of profit: an investor in the 90th percentile of earnings in the infrequent information group saw 80% higher profits than an investor in the 90th percentile in the frequent information group; a 25th percentile investor in the infrequent information group returned a profit, whereas a 25th percentile investor in the frequent information group returned a loss.",1634969863,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdza5i/myopic_loss_aversion/

They were looking at the year graph of shiba inu. One of them told the others he is going to invest €50 into shiba because if it goes to 'even' €0.01 he will turn it into €20k. 
I could not hold myself back so I stepped forward trying to explain to him that if shiba would go to 0.01 its market cap would be like $5T because the coin supply of Shiba inu is just so absurdly high and then there would be more money in crypto than there is in the entire world with stocks and everything. I also told him to check out the graph. You could clearly see a large spike in april/may and now a large spike again. In between nothing happened with Shiba at all. So I asked him what he thinks will happen to shiba this time. Obviously an equal drop as in May is way more likely than another pump. 
He just said well it's only €50 if I lose it it's fine but it could go to at least €20k.
The crazy thing is he told me he already has an account on Kraken and is investing in Crypto. He just needs a new account at Coinbase because Kraken does not list Shiba. So this guy is already part of crypto and has no idea about Market cap, coin supply etc.

How do you ever time the market to do that?!   
Well young ape, let me give you a few tips. Regardless of what crypto currency you hold there are a few things that will help significantly with timing the market. 

1. Bitcoin: BTC is big papa, and every other coin in the market depends on what bitcoin is doing. There are a few outliers, BTC doesn't control development of projects or news but it holds well over 60% of the market dominance and usually much more in bear markets. 
2. Fear and greed index: Compare this index to BTC charts and look at the comparisons between the movement of the two, when we are highly fearful, it usually means we are consolidating and gathering rocket fuel. When we are extremely greedy, that usually means we are very far away from any support on the chart, usually moving averages. 
3. DO YOUR RESEARCH: Read whitepapers, don't buy something because Joe Blow from 7/11 told you that cryptobites were the next biggest thing since the resurrection of Tupac. If you hear about something, read into it, read the white paper, watch some content on it, see if there is a FAQ or a discord server where you can get more information. Information is key and the last thing you want to be part of is a rugpull (When talking about micro caps) or buying a worthless NFT for way more then its worth (talking to you Jake Paul.) 
4. DON'T FOMO YOU MONKEY: Do not FOMO into the market, we make money from FOMO and sell to those morons just as we drop 50% in a single day. The previous ATH we were given three separate signals to sell, the fear and green index was screaming extreme greed at us for almost a week before big daddy Elon tweeted about it.    
5. Take some gosh dang profits my neighbor: There is no reason for you not to be taking profits on the way up, as much as comparing charts, graphs, giraffes, right angle triangles, Murphy's law, quantum programming, Fibonacci retracement, time traveling or any kind of Rick and Morty s\*\*t just take some profit on the way up. Are we 25% above the 200 day moving average and the fear and greed index just grabbed us through our screen and yelled ""WE ARE AT 95/100 TODAY! RUN BUDDY, RUN!"" take some profit, don't sell everything, but making 25% and buying back in at the 200 day moving average is going to make you more money over the course of the bull rull then any other method of HODL'ing will ever do. Well, unless you buy the peeks and sell the dips, don't do that.",1634968413,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdyy5z/how_to_actually_make_money_in_crypto/

Tezos - I call it ""ecstacy"" but my buddy calls it ""ex-tee-zed""

Ethereum - the way i say it, it rhymes with Keith, but others claim that it rhymes with Meth

Dogecoin - i say it ""dough-ge"" but the same buddy of mine claims it rhymes with ""lodge""

Vechain - I say ""vet"" like the dog doctor. But others call it ""v-ee-t""

Secret- I just say secret, but I've heard people calling it ""skrrrt"" like some talented musicians do

Nano - I say neh-no. Others may call it ""nuh-no""

OriginTrial - i call it Trac like track, but people seem to prefer ""trace""

So what are the right ways to say them? 

And what's the strangest pronunciation of tickers or coins you've heard of?",1634966471,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdyits/how_do_you_pronounce_the_tickers_of_some_of_these/
22,CryptoCurrency,gifz,Never trade while drunk or under influence,"This is my sad story. I started trading with margin recently. I was going good, made 400% profit trading in 1 week and today I got drunk and went party with some friends. Without thinking much I have opened a long position with 10x margin and I got liquidated from all my profit + initial investment cause I was thinking emotionally instead of thinking rationally.

So, if you start trading or investing, do it while sober and do it rationally. Follow the red candles and not the green ones and AVOID AT ALL COSTS TRADING WHILE UNDER INFLUENCE OF ANY SUBSTANCE.

Set your limits, take your profits but never go too emotional while trading, that's my today's advice after losing a lot of money.",1634966430,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdyiib/never_trade_while_drunk_or_under_influence/

Yesterday everyone were complaining how this was a bad idea and how crypto is a scam to loot our money.

I want to explain things to them but I kinda fear that they will blame me for their stupid mistakes in future. So I keep the whole crypto thing a secret in college.

This is why knowledge about crypto is important before entering. Everyone wants 100x return in overnight, which needs a lot of luck.

98,CryptoCurrency,Competitive-Cow-8055,FINANCIAL ADVICE: Use 2FA On Everything!!,"This Goes out to everyone not using 2FA security! Since it is up to you to secure your account and protect your crypto, two-factor is a must!!

If you use any cryptocurrency exchange, you’ll want to use some form of two-factor authentication to secure your account, The primary reason for this is that in crypto, unlike with say your bank account, there is no fraud protection or recovery process for stolen funds if your accounts get hacked!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""A 2019 report from Microsoft concluded that **2FA works, blocking 99.9% of automated attacks**. If a service provider supports multi-factor authentication, Microsoft recommends using it, even if it's as simple as SMS-based one-time passwords""

# What is Two-Factor Authentication?

In simple terms, two-factor authentication is a second layer of security that involves a unique code being generated on an app on your phone or other electronic device, That code, along with your username and password, is used to log into accounts on which you’ve set up two-factor, This means, on accounts where you have 2FA set up, you’ll need both the 2FA code for that specific account and the username and password to log in!

# Why you need it?

Even strong passwords can be broken or compromised by a remote attacker. if you have 2FA and someone who gets your password they will be prevented from gaining access to your wallet because they will also require your 2FA code. Unlike your password, your 2FA code changes with each login attempt and is retrieved from your mobile device, two-factor authentication means adding another layer of security to your account!

# What 2fa should i use?

top 5 authentication apps

&amp;#x200B;

1. [Authy ](https://authy.com/)— Easy to use, feature-rich and supports multi-device sync
2. [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US) — A widely adopted standard across major websites
3. [andOTP ](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP)— An open-source alternative that has more features than the competition
4. [LastPass Authenticator](https://lastpass.com/auth/) — Similar to Google Authenticator, but works within the LastPass ecosystem
5. [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator) — Also similar to Google Authenticator, but works especially well with Microsoft services

# What should i use 2FA on?

You should apply 2FA settings on Exchanges for logging and withdrawing funds and Email account or any other site or application that has sensitive information on it that you don't want compromised.

# Conclusion 

it's a matter of balancing security and convenience. But for most people, the few minutes it takes to set up an authenticator app are more than worth the benefit, Adding 2FA to your online accounts is one of the most important steps you can take right now to dramatically improve your online security.",1634960763,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdx5fh/financial_advice_use_2fa_on_everything/

2,CryptoCurrency,Some1fromReddit,"One day my portfolio was Down 99%, Today I broke even. Now I feel like a genius.","2 days ago I realized I was still down 90%.   So I grabbed a pencil, and paper to calculate exactly How much I really was down.      I went onto my banking app to print out transaction history, wrote down exactly how much USD I initially invested, stared at the number for a little bit then mediated to bring back memories of how much I valued USD at the time I bought in. 

A few minutes later, I recalled the memory.  I didn't think USD was worth shit at the time.  In fact I was disgusted about how much value it lost.   I felt it was really worth 1 penny for each dollar.  

So really, I invested 99 times less than what the amount was.      However, when I woke up today, my perspective completely changed.  I now value 1 US dollar to be equal to 1 US dollar.    

 That means I invested at a time where 1 USD was barley worth 1 penny.  So if I cash out today, 1 USD is now worth 1 USD.    So I'm not really down 99%.  I broke even.

Whereas other coins such as Eth, Sol, Btc continue to skyrocket, Monero remains the same in price. It's quite puzzling because when you look at use cases, it ticks all the boxes (anti-government, true decentralization, true privacy), however its barely getting any traction right now.

Is everyone planning to jump ship in the coming years into Monero, or does it need more development? Really want to know, because everyone continues to mention privacy, transaction costs/fees, 'rug pulls', but the traction for XMR just isn't there, regardless of the use cases.

* In May it was Bitcoin halving &amp; BTC price soar to $9800$  

* By the year end it traded $29000 (yes that's just insane)  
* So it saw a growth of 300% just in year 2020.

2021:  

2021 was best year for BTC.  
 
* In January itself it touched $40k.  
* In February it crossed $50k mark(Elon Musk also shown keen interest in Crypto and tweeted his opinion around it)  
* In April BTC recorded ATH at $64k  
a really amazing time or it was silence before the storm  
* In May BTC crashed by 50% (China's Ban, Tesla not accepting BTC, FUD)
* In September it rose again to $50k in span of 3 month it mostly recovered from crash.
* In October BTC recorded next ATH of $66.5k.  

* So this year BTC growth is 60% till October
And from start of 2020 BTC growth is massive 825%.

My main problem is that I cannot find the hash for the transaction at all! It's not appearing on any of the black chain explorer sites. I have confirmation that the coin was sent from Coinbase to a specific wallet address on Kraken (I'm sending coin from my wallet at Coinbase to my wallet at Kraken).

The transaction lists as ""completed"" yet, it does not show up on the block anywhere. 

How is this possible?

Coinbase does not even respond to my requests for details on the transaction saying just that it was ""completed""

If it was sent to another wallet address accidentally wouldn't Coinbase be able to tell me that wallet address?

65,CryptoCurrency,SuggestedName90,"Ethereum L2 Scaling is Here, You Don't Need to Wait For ETH2","Ethereum Scaling is always a contentious issue, but I believe it's often brought up mainly to discredit Ethereum rather than highlight a problem. At 49 gwei gas right now I wanted to bring up some ideas and mention the various scaling solutions Ethereum has. Check out [https://l2fees.info/](https://l2fees.info/) for information on the exact costs once you bridge over.

True L2s

**Optimistic Rollups**  
Optimistic Rollups are a scaling technology that relies on people disproving transactions rather than proving this. Thanks to this and tx batching as well as some off chain processing transactions become much cheaper and the chain only has to spend time fully processing contested transactions.

  
Arbitrum is the main implementation of Optimistic Rollups, at roughly $15 per coin to move on, and less for ETH, its a great option to move your coins over to. Platforms like Sushiswap, Uniswap, Aave, CREAM, and others have already moved over so if you want to start farming your sick yield farming gains you can hop on over right now and do everything you would want to do on Ethereum Mainnet but cheaper.  


Optimism, believe it not, does Optimistic Rollups. Its already supported by Chainlink, Uniswap, MakerDAO, and Compound. You can do everything to your hearts desire here with fees that work out to less than Arbitrum\* (fees not comparable as speeds are throttled during beta)  


**ZkSnarks**  
Zksnarks is math. It uses math to scale things, there are like 6 University papers you can read if you are really interested, but I am not going to throw math here that neither of us understand and call it an explanation. Obligatory Zero Knowledge Proof to cover buzzwords  


Zksync is the main implementation of this technology, and while they haven't seen as much adoption as others their fees are dirt cheap, they are battle-tested at this point and proven to be secure. They are bit harder to code for though, so make sure to petition your favorite platforms to move over! ZkSnarks are amazing and deserve more attention.  


&amp;#x200B;

**Commit Chains**  
Chains that are full standalone chains that submit checkpoints to the Ethereum mainnet. They don't benefit from Ethereum's security but can also have their own benefits of high throughput and compatbility.  


Polygon, its just Polygon. Pretty much everything has a Polygon deployment from 88mph to Aave to Sushiswap to even native protocols like Quickswap.  


Tl;Dr - Don't wait for ETH2! Make the L2 Jump today and start yield farming and decentralizing finance. Take this post as the kick to get you to actually log into that website, click the ""move to l2"" button, pay $30, and enjoy a whole new world!

What is Bounce?

Bounce is a decentralized auction platform, incorporating liquidity mining, decentralized governance and staking mechanisms. The first principle of Bounce is scarcity of resources, which creates a competitive swap environment. 

The origin of Bounce

The idea of “swap” originated from Uniswap, where infinite liquidity is provided for participants. While this is a great and concept, Bounce focusses on the opposite scenario instead. 

Bounce provides a competitive environment, for a limited supply of tokens or other assets like NFT's. The assets can be auctioned off in various ways, such as:

Ah, the easy knee jerk blather about Crypto assets being all about the criminals and illegal nefarious activities.

If you’ve read about the Pandora Paper leaks, perhaps you noticed the utter lack of finger pointing at cryptocurrencies amongst all the tales of money laundering and tax evasion.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, here’s an interesting article - not by some crypto pumping website, but The Economist. Next time someone throws out the evil crypto line share this link to them…

**Billions of banknotes are missing. Why does nobody care?**

[https://www.economist.com/1843/2021/10/18/billions-of-banknotes-are-missing-why-does-nobody-care](https://www.economist.com/1843/2021/10/18/billions-of-banknotes-are-missing-why-does-nobody-care)

’Tis a very interesting and quite entertaining read - here’s some quotes that hopefully will encourage you to read the whole article :-

&amp;#x200B;

“According to the National Audit Office, which scrutinises public-sector accounts, the value of all the sterling-denominated notes in existence has tripled in the past 20 years. It now totals around £75bn.

If you’re looking to public records to see what’s driving this demand you won’t have much luck. Only a third of that £75bn is being circulated in the kind of day-to-day transactions that officials can monitor. The remaining £50bn is out there somewhere, being put to unknown uses. “The Bank of England doesn’t know where, who by or what for, and doesn’t seem very curious,” said Meg Hillier, head of a parliamentary committee that recently investigated the future of cash.”

&amp;#x200B;

and this… my emphasis in bold (!)

“These days offshore banking is a highly risky option for criminals who want to move their ill-gotten gains into another jurisdiction. **Cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, are illiquid, volatile and hard to spend in the legitimate economy**. So criminals often fall back on the oldest technology, one that is anonymous, robust and universally accepted. “Bulk cash-smuggling is the crudest and most primitive, but still the most effective, means of evading detection for money-launderers,” Rijock told me.

As central bankers ponder where their banknotes are, officials who are fighting money-laundering say it’s no great mystery. **By some estimates, perhaps half of all cash in circulation is helping criminals evade governments’ increasingly intrusive surveillance of the financial system**.”",1634954679,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdvkgh/money_laundering_other_financial_shenanigans/

Some of the most reliable people I watch are saying an 85% drop is possible. I believe this for a lot of alts but BTC and ETH have gained so much traction even just since this summer it seems less likely we are going to get bargain prices again. 

Do y’all plan on taking some profits at the “top” in the blue chips or only in the alts? 

This bear market just feels like it’ll be different bc of the rising adoption but Honestly nothing gets me going like the thought of having a pile of cash sitting in stablecoins ready when prices drop big time.

73,CryptoCurrency,FinishGloomy,"Bitcoin ETF, good or bad for the cryptosphere?","As we all know, and for those who don't, BTC ETF launched this friday and has jumped 4.8% in its first day of trading. 

To tell you what a BTC ETF is, it is merely mirroring the price of BTC itself and will not provide any form of ownership of the said currency, instead, you are investing on the investment vehicle.

Now you might ask, why not just invest my money directly to BTC instead of going through a middleman? 

Reasons are, newer investors would not have to bother themselves with the security procedures associated with holding the said or any other cryptocurrency, leading to not needing to educate oneself thoroughly with how crypto wallets or exchanges work, decreasing the overall process and making it so much easier as you can just buy and sell the crypto ETF through traditional markets and exchanges. 

Another crucial benefit(?) is, since you're investing on a investment vehicle, you will be able to short sell the said crypto ETF if you somehow believe the price of it will go down in the future.

Now what do you think? will this turn out good for BTC and the whole cryptosphere in general since this will bring more exposure for newer investors to try out the market? or do you think it will be bad long term because of increased possibility of manipulation since it will now be much more easier to short sell?",1634954577,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdvjf7/bitcoin_etf_good_or_bad_for_the_cryptosphere/

It looks like you can connect it to any exchanges and wallets you want, as long as you keep them separate from your personal ones.  It looks like they offer Roth, too, which would be great if any coins I'm in decide to moon.

85,CryptoCurrency,mythstified,I'm considering selling my ADA for AVAX,"I do love ADA but I fear the upsides won't be as profitable during this current cycle as its already near the top of the totem pole. I can see it easily getting to $4 or maybe $5 but that's only 2x potential. I'm purely looking at this from a profit perspective.

AVAX has a much lower cap and has tons of hype around it. The fundamentals sound great.

Going from 65 to 130 just means getting a market cap of 30b, SOL has 60b and ADA has 70b.  For ADA to go to 4 that means 140b. 

So it seems FAR more realistic to 2x on AVAX.

In fact if ADA were to 2x, for AVAX to grab its same capitalization of 79b it would 8x to about $300.  I totally feel that's reasonable!

Question is should I wait for the last big dip before the real run up? Historically that'll happen. Or just buy a HODL...

Also, if another coin has similar fundamentals let me know. I really don't want to miss an obvious play.

For example, you guys keep talking about ONE... Would ONE be smarter than AVAX?

The Polygon network would be at risk of losing approximately $850 Million if this bug wasn't found. If an attacker spent just $100,000 dollars, the Polygon network would lose more than $22 Million dollars each time.  The vulnerability allowed an attacker to exit their burn transaction from the bridge up to 223 times. Meaning the Polygon network could've lost up to $850 Million.

NFTs have so many more use cases that can - and will - be utilized in the future

• Property Deeds - ever bought property? Did you pay to insure that the deed would be in your name? If it was recorded on the blockchain as an NFT, you wouldn't need to

• Prescriptions - fraudulent prescriptions run rampant. Want to eliminate that? Make an NFT out of them tied to the person getting the script from the prescribing doctor and record it on the blockchain

• Tickets - not just concerts or movies (though those are totally useful) but think of airlines or hotel reservations - an NFT is solid

• Car titles and other forms of proof of ownership (see the deeds bullet)

• Gaming - Imagine picking up epic gear in a tiles and still owning it when version 12 of the game comes out. Or carrying it across games the devs put out

• Speaking of gaming - casino chips. Your winnings are yours and recorded on the blockchain - no one can steal your chips and you don't have to worry about leaving them on the table

- Which projects do you truly BELIEVE in long term and which ones are your “quick outs”?

- Write them down in a HODL/Sell list. You are more likely to commit to your decision when it’s on paper

- Never sell BTC! Yes, some of the alts will outperform BTCs current gains especially if it hits the $100,00 mark. But remember, BTC is your shining soldier that will march to a triumphant $1,000,000 in 8yrs after some more bull markets.

There is a catch, though. Moon distributions happen monthly and they decrease every round, so you are racing against time. That is why it is important to set up your vaults as soon as possible. Some users regret not having set them up earlier and missed on owning  what would now be considerable amounts of moons. 

""But moons aren't worth the trouble"" you may say. Well, maybe you are right, and moons won't go very far. There are, after all, countless dead projects everywhere. That is true. 

However, not many projects begin within communities already numbering in the millions of people devoted to crypto. Also, there aren't that many moons out there, unlike the doges and billions of shibs in existence. There is considerable upside for this coin and you could begin earning them without spending a single buck.

In fact, if you set up a vault, you can revive them for free in this faucet https://www.moonfaucet.cc/

So, what are you waiting for? Just set that damn vault already! If they become valuable, you'll be thankful you did it. If they don't, you'll just have spent a few minutes of your time. Seems like a decent trade-off to me.

For NANO I use Natrium, also found in the app stores.

I have reaised 5 support tickets and all i receive is the aSAME BOT MESSAGE WHICH IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TO MY ISSUE. This is when I realised how absolutely incompetent metamask support is. Till date all I have received is bot messages which are just irrelevant to my query and it has been over 1 week since this occured. Really if i had lost money through a bank they would be responding through a real person 24/7. Wallets are the future of decentralisation and this level of support is absolutely irresponsible. I think people need to be warned about the risks of using metamask and the lack of support thereof if their tokens dissapear. I can see to which address the BNB tokens i transferred have gone to but it is frustrating that neihter BSc scan or Metamask will respond.

Get you some before next year.,"Look  at the charts and compare movement of recent buy/sell pressure between  the top coins. ETC is rock hard to push up. Once ETH goes 2.0 Mining  will move, and IF ETH pumps, BTC may lose wind permanently, the only  thing holding BTC up is ASIC mining investment. IF ETH goes N.1, ETC is  going to pump hard on the GPU mining that will move in, that is the real  user base anyhow.

And even if  there is thorough long term down pressure on ETC from mining it will  pump in the next 6 months through the transition as miners move in and  accumulate ETC and dry up the open market. This whale market making  action occurs when new large investors want control over the space of  the token, and ETC is bargain bin right now. Even if ETC plateaus for a  long time due to mining and market making its likely to stay locked on  an upward price trajectory from eventual inflows from ETH going N.1

And  there's always the laws being discussed in the US about designating  some coins as commodities and others as securities. If that passes, ETC  moon launch go alpha niner.

65,CryptoCurrency,yunhaila,HOW to recognize whale activity vs Algorithm trading activity,"You see MATIC rise 20% in one minute from $1.2 to $1.4 and continue to rise during its latest run seemingly out of nowhere. Then articles start coming up like “Polygon Becoming More Independent From Ethereum as App Numbers Rise: Report” and pr articles come out saying “MATIC $3? Likely” beware. This is the probably a situation where whales are buying up, injecting hopium through the news, and dump on the innocent late buyers. 

By the time you see the first news and see volume start forming, you are early in the pump. After the pump, however long it lasts, then the pull back will occur due to the whale dumping to rebalance their portfolio. 

Increasingly, algorithm trading is being used to create buy and sell orders without being easily detected by the chart monkeys. These will appear seemingly out of nowhere and be very sudden in times of big buys or selloffs. They rely on indicators like RSI, standard deviation, signals, etc. don’t be fooled that a coin is on a bull run even when you see huge increase in volume. Like when ERGO’s activity spiked from $5m volume to $15m volume for a day, it was due to algos trading every $.01 movement.

6,CryptoCurrency,thejordanproject,This is how I currently use Algo and Tinyman to get a head start on upcoming Yieldly staking pools. Algo DeFi FTW.,"tl;dr: buy algo &gt; send to tinyman, swap to token of choice coming to Yieldly &gt; Stake YLDLY and token for more, and smoke a joint and wait.

Algo defi is in it's early development stages, and it feels like exciting times for everyone involved. Lots is being built right now, and the time is now for algo holders to invest in early projects on the algo blockchain. For those interested in dipping their toes into Algo Defi via Yieldly and Tinyman, here's what I'm currently doing with decent success. 

I present to you, **an intro to Algo DeFi:** 

**Decentralized Finance?**
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a movement that uses decentralized networks and blockchains to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that work without intermediaries.

**Algo**
Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain. It's fast, cheap, secure, and has a bright future IMO. Learn more at https://www.algorand.com.

**Algo Defi**

From Algo's website: ""With unique Layer-1 standards, approach to smart contracts, and interoperability frameworks, Algorand enables DeFi organizations to leverage the core principles and value of decentralized technology to define the future of finance."" Sounds pretty tasty to me. [https://www.algorand.com/resources/defi](Learn more] on Algorand's website.

**Yieldly**

Yieldly has built the world’s first DeFi products on Algorand protocol. Users can enjoy Yieldly’s No-Loss Prize Games, YLDY Staking and YLDY Cross-Chain Swapping, and trade faster, with lower fees and more security than any other protocol. Yieldly is delivering its mission to create the next-generation DeFi ecosystem; one which enables the lightest and fastest digital asset exchange accessible across all major chains.   

yieldly.finance
https://twitter.com/yieldlyfinance  
https://www.np.reddit.com/r/yieldly  

**Tinyman**  

Tinyman is a decentralized trading protocol which utilizes the fast and secure framework of the Algorand blockchain, creating an open and safe marketplace for traders, liquidity providers, and developers.

https://tinyman.org/  
https://www.np.reddit.com/r/Tinyman  


With all that out of the way, here's what I do. I check the Yieldly subreddit and Twitter for updates on upcoming staking pools. They typically give a week or more heads up prior to launching these pools. Yieldly is rather new, so this pattern could change, but the first couple staking pools that launched on Yieldly popped when listed (Smile, and OPUL). I'm not a huge fan of these projects, but I can see the general pattern. Getting listed on Yieldly = good for new algo projects, whether that project be good or bad. That said, I'm excited about both XET and Algogems, two upcoming staking pools. 

If you've dabbled with Yieldly or Algo, please share your thoughts. Would love to hear feedback on this. Cheers!

When you DYOR, you just end up looking for information that is consistent with your existing beliefs. 

DOGE and Elon brought in so many new people to crypto, we’re 3 years further along than we would’ve been without them. Now that the hype has died down, these new investors are turning to legitimate projects and pumping your bags. God bless you, Elon Musk!

Your $30 of ETH is now worth $35, you’ve got 0.005 BTC, a handful of shitcoins going nowhere while the rest are owned by institutional investors, banks, billionaires, Russia, the Chinese government and the 1%, and yet, somehow, crypto is going to change the world. Uh-huh. Sure. 

This is the top. It’s all downhill from here. You should probably sell before you lose it all. 

You should never trust anything you read on this sub. Including this.

so many people here have made gains and may not know but the irs HATES this one little trick... (not really it's all on the up and up) if you have any crypto (or stocks, real-estate, etc) and plan to donate to a charity anyway donate the asset directly to the charity. as long as it's been held a year (think long term cap gains) you get to write off the full amount donated, you pay NO TAX on that transaction the charity pays NO TAX on that transaction, and they get much more money.   
now you can jut go buy back in at the current price (after 30 days, wash sale rules etc) and enjoy your FREE BUMP IN COST BASIS.   


then you (I think) need to wait 30 days before buying back what you took out to avoid wash sale rules, or use that time to diversify your portfolio and just buy a different coin with that money right away.   


want to cash out a bunch of money and plan to give to charity over the long term anyway? does your charity not accept crypto??? ....well setup a ""DONOR ADVISED FUND"" through vanguard or similar btc friendly entity and you can donate a bunch of bitcoin to the donor advised fund, which you still control the investment of (though in normal stocks not btc, for now) and you can write off all that you donate the time you donate it, and dish it out to charities as you see fit. the only catch is any money put in there has to go to charities, you can never have it back yourself. unless of course you pull and trump and make a charity with you and your fam at the board and pay yourself and get investigated for fraud, probably.",1634946206,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdt95c/tax_leveraged_donations_do_this_if_donating_to/

39,CryptoCurrency,Apprehensive_Log2968,What is an Oracle/Oracle Pool - Ergo &amp; Chainlink being Cardano’s Oracles together? - Ergo benefits [simple explanation]," 

# Let's cover some Oracles concerns.

1. ***What is an Oracle, and what is its function.***
2. ***Why a multiplicity of Oracles is good and how they can work together.***
3. ***Oracle pools and the role of Ergo***

# What is an Oracle, and what is its function.

An oracle connects the blockchain with off-chain data.

We need the blockchain to be connected with the real world. We need to get the price of BTC into smart-contracts to have DeFi. **Oracle solves this.**

An oracle enters every data input through an external transaction. This way, we can ensure that the blockchain contains all of the information required to verify itself. This is why oracles are known as blockchain middleware: They are the bridge between the two worlds.

# Why a multiplicity of Oracles is good and how they can work together.

Cardano believes in choice, so anyone can create its external oracle source and plug it in the system.

Cardano offers the possibility of layering verification sources for the best fine-tuning of the level of assurance available to smart contracts.

Oracles are only as good as the quantity and quality of data they provide. And smart contracts are only as good as the quality of data they work with.

The best data you can have, the better are your applications and their capabilities. That is why Cardano chose to provide as many sources as possible to smart contract developers.

In this landscape, the Ergo Oracle Pools (explained later) would compete with Chainlink in a free market, as it’s the programmer of the smart contract on Cardano that will have the choice to use whatever he wants as a source and structure it as he wants.

This provides the best prices for data; the developer can easily choose when to use an oracle for its app and when to use another one.

So for those wondering, how is it possible that more than one oracle provides data to a blockchain? That is the most straightforward explanation you can get! A developer will choose whatever Oracle likes the most or the one that fits the most.

# Oracle pools and the role of Ergo

*I will be using Cardano as an example of blockchain benefiting from ergo, but ergo is not dependent on Cardano; it can provide data to any blockchain.*

Oracles pools will be **essential** for all applications, not just financial ones, as We will need all kinds of data outside the blockchain to run applications. The layered oracle groups with deviation checking consensus allowed Ergo to open up a whole new world of applications.

Ergo is a [pioneer](https://youtu.be/pTV1F-fZgG8) in the field of Oracle Pools.

**What is an oracle pool tho?**

**📷**

**A very short way of understanding and go back to whatever you were doing before**: Better to have a pool of oracles within a confidence hierarchies being faster cheaper, and more beneficial to the end-user than having multiple single oracle data points such as in Chainlink's design.

Yet, the internet deals with a tremendous amount of data, and it’s not true that everything is correct. That’s why it’s essential to access real information. We can do this via assessing a trust score to data sources, regrouping them, and putting them on a hierarchical trust level. That’s how we can effectively use an immense amount of data easily and fast. Chainlink’s design doesn’t allow that because it has an **individualist** design, and it’s hard enough encoding hierarchical trust scores to individual oracles, never mind oracle pools.

* Oracle Pools use the base cryptocurrency of the blockchain for funds/payments/stake. This means they do not require anyone to purchase or use an extra token like LINK, which provides no value to end-users or the oracles themselves, but instead makes adoption needlessly more complex.
* By design, oracle pools divide time into epochs where oracles must post within. This provides a framework for building stronger incentives for ensuring data feeds are updated on a schedule, making collusion less profitable and allowing for more reliable data feeds.
* Similarly, epochs provide a perfect way to implement disincentives, such as stake slashing (oracles joining a pool have to put up collateral to join).
* Thanks to extended UTXO, we can easily construct arbitrarily large oracle datapoint hierarchies of confidence, making it possible to have pools of pools (continuing to higher tiers as well) and thereby scale accuracy upwards at the cost of price/speed. This isn’t possible with ChainkLink’s design because oracles are inherently sole actors, and there is no design for aggregating aggregators and having that scale. Furthermore, the lack of the UTXO model prevents such hierarchies from working well at all. The accumulation of data upwards through the hierarchy and the dispersal of funds from the top downwards are both an order of magnitude more complex to perform (and likely more prone to bugs/errors), which translates to higher costs and making it an open question whether it is viable at all on an account-based model.
* Furthermore, data points generated by an Oracle Pool (on a UTXO system with data inputs) are accessible by anyone at next to no extra cost. This means that they can easily be used by any dApp on the blockchain, thereby making oracle pools much more like a public good. Thus even small “p2p” smart contracts between two individuals (say in Africa who can’t afford to pay for oracle data explicitly) can still access vital oracle data feeds. This is something highly novel and quite exciting in my book.
* It is trivial for a dApp to use data points from multiple oracle pools in a single tx. Allows for more complex DeFi dApps to come about while still being reasonably priced.

*More explanation at the end, in sources ""Oracle pool.""*

For Cardano, this will mean access to more layers of data availability, veracity, and completeness, all available to programmers on the Cardano blockchain directly from Ergo Oracles through an API.

**This feature will probably be required by the most sensitive applications that need a high degree of assurance that we can trust the external data to execute some code with high value at risk.** And the most sensitive apps and dApps will also probably be the most lucrative ones as they will need the highest degree of assurance they can get.

Thanks to the hard work being put into interoperability between the UTXO Alliance programmers will also have the choice between

* Having their smart contract on Cardano or Ergo and easily switch between them.
* Having one part on Cardano because some part of the execution needs something PoS is best at providing (governance, for example). Another aspect of the smart contract logic on Ergo is that Ergo offers some other unique capabilities like privacy derived from the mathematical specificities of PoW.

This way, Cardano and Ergo, together, will provide the best of both worlds.

41,CryptoCurrency,Valtisiyo,Would you risk aggregating all your login info in one place?,"I just went onto Mint to get a look at how all my fiat is doing. Lo and behold, on their front page there's an announcement that they're now able to track crypto! I thought that was pretty rad since by my estimate I've got roughly 5-10% of my total assets in crypto right now, and they listed pretty much all the exchanges I use.

Only hiccup is: it doesn't look like Mint is doing what Koinly and other crypto aggregation sites do, which is querying account APIs. Instead, when I went to add my BlockFi account, it asked me for my username and password, just like with all my fiat accounts. It would also need 2FA and all that. 

Idk, maybe it's because I've been paranoid about security with crypto since I got into the space, or maybe I've heard too many horror stories on here about people getting hacked...but it just doesn't feel right to me to potentially aggregate all my login info across all my crypto accounts in one space, even if it would mean easy tracking of all my assets at once.

I’ve been involved in crypto for about a 2 years now. My first exchange was coinbase. Not coin base pro, just Coinbase. Oh my first coin was XLM. The first time it bumped, I immediately withdrew all of it out of fear of now losing gains. After that I studied a little more, got my nerve back and went in a little harder with: XLM, CLGD, ADA &amp; UNI. My money did nothing but a while and after the next very small bump I converted everything into ETH. And then DOGE. Then there was a stupid big bump and even getting out a little bit late I still did pretty good. And at this point I felt like I needed to use this incredibly lucky timing to be smart with all this potential. I still have a small amount in Coinbase, where I trade between coins in an effort to grow that bag but I’ve expanded into BlockFi, where I DCA BTC and ETH. I also have their credit card for the 1% reinvest. I DCA on Binance for ALG and ONE and a very little on Kraken for XMR. That’s it. So, even with all the mistakes and the reality that I haven’t been into crypto long enough to be a HODLer, I have basically doubled my investments in one year.

If bitcoin were to hit $1 million per coin, a ""Sat"" would finally be worth $.01 USD.  That coke from the vending machine would cost you 100 Sats instead of .00000100 bitcoin.

Now, we could look at this and say ""well bitcoin has a cap!  Well, they could adjust the code to allow smaller amounts, but let's look at ETH.

The most common usage for ETH is gwei.  Gwei is 1 billionth of an ETH.  So if ETH hits $1 million each, don't worry, we finally got to $.01 per gwei.  BUT, here is the catch.  The smallest unit isn't gwei.  Wei is 1 billionth a GWEI!  Talk about scaling potential for price.

In short, we don't have to have ""simple"" 1 to 1 ratios on the primary name for a coin to be used.  As a community, we just have to start using the smaller denominations when discussing use.

The most common usage for ETH is gwei.  Gwei is 1 billionth of an ETH.  So if ETH hits $1 million each, don't worry, we finally got to $.01 per gwei.  BUT, here is the catch.  The smallest unit isn't gwei.  Wei is 1 billionth a GWEI!  Talk about scaling potential for price.

In short, we don't have to have ""simple"" 1 to 1 ratios on the primary name for a coin to be used.  As a community, we just have to start using the smaller denominations when discussing use for smaller usage.  Remember, many chains, like ETH can be modified to lower gas fees as the price goes up.

Bring me to paying 100 gwei for a coke please!",1634944293,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdsprj/btceth_future_use_during_moon/

78,CryptoCurrency,Badmac1388,Cryptocurrencies biggest flaw and cryptojacking who knew ?,"Doing some Friday night reading and came across what is considered cryptocurrencies biggest flaw and cryptojacking so passing it on to my crypto newbie compatriots.It is Double-spending the risk that money will be spent twice. Blockchains prevent this problem by tracking every time money changes hands,making it easy to notice when someone tries double-spending. Cryptocurrencies avoid this problem unless they're hit with a 51% attack.

A 51% attack can occur when a miner or group of miners controls more computing power than every other miner of a particular cryptocurrency combined. In other words they control at least 51% of all the computing power on the network and they can rewrite the blockchain allowing themselves unlimited amounts of money by canceling past transactions and so on.

Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of your device to mine cryptocurrency for someone else. This often happens when hackers install mining code on a hacked website then when you visit the site your browser app will run the code and mine crypto that goes to the hackers wallet. None of your money is stolen but your CPU spends all its energy mining it drains your battery and makes your device overheat and slow to a crawl.
Never heard of cryptojacking before has anyone had this happen to them ? And do you consider the 51% attack cryptocurrencies biggest flaw?

&amp;#x200B;

The 'Stock-to-flow' is a number that shows how many years, at the current production rate, are required to achieve the current stock. The higher the number, the higher the price. The stock-to-flow model is generally applied to natural resources such as gold or silver, often referred to as “store of value” resources that, in theory, should retain their value over the long term due to their scarcity and low flow. The idea is that low supply makes the metals more like “hard money” – contrasted with the dollar. This is an especially harsh juxtaposition as the Federal Reserve has printed more than $4 trillion in fresh dollars since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March 2020; that’s the same amount the U.S. central bank had previously created since it was established early in the last century. It’s worth noting the model relies heavily on the assumption that the scarcity of the cryptocurrency should drive value, which might not always be the case.

With the model first being released with the price of bitcoin around $3,000, the price of bitcoin impressively oscillated around the model over the past two years. Over the past few months as the price has retraced 50% from April’s highs, the deviation from the model value widened to historic levels. It was dangerously close to being invalidated but thanks to the recent rally back to new all time highs, we’re still in the game. 

The bitcoin stock-to-flow model currently suggests the price of bitcoin should be around $94,476. As of writing, BTC is trading around $61,000. Bitcoin is guaranteed to hit six figures in the next few months according to the model, so things could get pretty crazy. 

The model predicts a Bitcoin price of $288,000 by 2024.",1634942694,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qds8bi/the_bitcoin_stocktoflow_s2f_model_could_still_be/

37,CryptoCurrency,dmiddy,"Your Chosen ""Ethereum Killer"" Is Going To Be Eaten By Ethereum Layer 2s, It Just Doesn't Know It Yet"," 

This idea was recently popularize by twitter user [https://twitter.com/epolynya](https://twitter.com/epolynya)

With the launch of two Layer 2 scaling solutions, Optimism and Arbitrum, it is now a false equivalency to be comparing your chosen layer 1 blockchain to Ethereum.

Eventually, the average Ethereum user will not interact with layer 1, therefore the layer 2s will be processing the bulk of activity on the chain.

When you look at Solana/BSC and see amazing TPS and cheap fees, you must compare that to what Eth layer 2 scaling solutions can handle(which is much, much more than Solana).

Once the miniscule and instant transactions of layer 2 Ethereum draw you in, you can rest easy knowing that you've just transacted on one of the most Decentralized blockchains available today.

**Solana, BSC = Monolithic blockchain = trying to do everything in one layer = centralization**

**Ethereum = Modular blockchain = splitting up tasks into layers = preserve decentralization**

"" **Anything any monolithic blockchain (L1) can ever do, a single zkRollup can do it significantly (&gt;10x) better. And there can be hundreds or thousands of zkRs interoperating relatively seamlessly.** ""

A zkRollup is a technique in which transactions are batched off-chain and settled on-chain. Put more simply, it is a much more efficient usage of block space on Ethereum Layer 1.

Instead of 1 transaction taking up 1 transaction worth of block space, Layer 2s allow for many transactions to occupy that space.

Add on to this that there can be ""hundreds or thousands"" of rollup projects operating at the same time, and modular blockchains have solved scalability and thus have solved the [Scalability Trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition)

Ethereum, Tezos, Cardano, and others have seen that monolithic architecture is extremely limiting in the long-term, even if it provides short-term advantages.

What's more, *monolithic blockchains are more likely to pivot to becoming rollups for Ethereum than they are to kill it.*

Once projects realize that all the users are on Ethereum, they will understand that the best decision they can make to improve their project is to pivot away from being their own monolithic chain.

The future lies in Modular Blockchains.

46,CryptoCurrency,Daniumy,What is an Oracle/Oracle Pool - Ergo &amp; Chainlink being Cardano’s Oracles together? - Ergo benefits [simple 8 min read],"# Let's cover some Oracles concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

1. ***What is an Oracle, and what is its function.***
2. ***Why a multiplicity of Oracles is good and how they can work together.***
3. ***Oracle pools and the role of Ergo***

# What is an Oracle, and what is its function.

In the blockchain, an oracle connects it with off-chain data.

We need the blockchain to be connected with the real world. We need to get the price of BTC into smart-contracts to have DeFi. **Oracle solves this.**

An oracle enters every data input through an external transaction. This way, we can ensure that the blockchain contains all of the information required to verify itself. This is why oracles are known as blockchain middleware: They are the bridge between the two worlds.

# Why a multiplicity of Oracles is good and how they can work together.

Cardano believes in choice, so anyone can create its external oracle source and plug it in the system.

Cardano offers the possibility of layering verification sources for the best fine-tuning of the level of assurance available to smart contracts.

Oracles are only as good as the quantity and quality of data they provide. And smart contracts are only as good as the quality of data they work with.

The best data you can have, the better are your applications and their capabilities. That is why Cardano chose to provide as many sources as possible to smart contract developers.

In this landscape, the Ergo Oracle Pools (explained later) would compete with Chainlink in a free market, as it’s the programmer of the smart contract on Cardano that will have the choice to use whatever he wants as a source and structure it as he wants.

This provides the best prices for data; the developer can easily choose when to use an oracle for its app and when to use another one.

So for those wondering, how is it possible that more than one oracle provides data to a blockchain? That is the most straightforward explanation you can get! A developer will choose whatever Oracle likes the most or the one that fits the most.

# Oracle pools and the role of Ergo

*I will be using Cardano as an example of blockchain benefiting from ergo, but ergo is not dependent on Cardano; it can provide data to any blockchain.*

Oracles pools will be **essential** for all applications, not just financial ones, as We will need all kinds of data outside the blockchain to run applications. The layered oracle groups with deviation checking consensus allowed Ergo to open up a whole new world of applications.

Ergo is a [pioneer](https://youtu.be/pTV1F-fZgG8) in the field of Oracle Pools.

**What is an oracle pool tho?**

&amp;#x200B;

[A picture is worth a thousand words](https://preview.redd.it/84q28fvxq2v71.jpg?width=690&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1a427a8b0e24a09b55a4cabf668dc566f71b840)

**A very short way of understanding and go back to whatever you were doing before**: Better to have a pool of oracles within a confidence hierarchies being faster cheaper, and more beneficial to the end-user than having multiple single oracle data points such as in Chainlink's design.

Yet, the internet deals with a tremendous amount of data, and it’s not true that everything is correct. That’s why it’s essential to access real information. We can do this via assessing a trust score to data sources, regrouping them, and putting them on a hierarchical trust level. That’s how we can effectively use an immense amount of data easily and fast. Chainlink’s design doesn’t allow that because it has an **individualist** design, and it’s hard enough encoding hierarchical trust scores to individual oracles, never mind oracle pools.

* Oracle Pools use the base cryptocurrency of the blockchain for funds/payments/stake. This means they do not require anyone to purchase or use an extra token like LINK, which provides no value to end-users or the oracles themselves, but instead makes adoption needlessly more complex.
* By design, oracle pools divide time into epochs where oracles must post within. This provides a framework for building stronger incentives for ensuring data feeds are updated on a schedule, making collusion less profitable and allowing for more reliable data feeds.
* Similarly, epochs provide a perfect way to implement disincentives, such as stake slashing (oracles joining a pool have to put up collateral to join).
* Thanks to extended UTXO, we can easily construct arbitrarily large oracle datapoint hierarchies of confidence, making it possible to have pools of pools (continuing to higher tiers as well) and thereby scale accuracy upwards at the cost of price/speed. This isn’t possible with ChainkLink’s design because oracles are inherently sole actors, and there is no design for aggregating aggregators and having that scale. Furthermore, the lack of the UTXO model prevents such hierarchies from working well at all. The accumulation of data upwards through the hierarchy and the dispersal of funds from the top downwards are both an order of magnitude more complex to perform (and likely more prone to bugs/errors), which translates to higher costs and making it an open question whether it is viable at all on an account-based model.
* Furthermore, data points generated by an Oracle Pool (on a UTXO system with data inputs) are accessible by anyone at next to no extra cost. This means that they can easily be used by any dApp on the blockchain, thereby making oracle pools much more like a public good. Thus even small “p2p” smart contracts between two individuals (say in Africa who can’t afford to pay for oracle data explicitly) can still access vital oracle data feeds. This is something highly novel and quite exciting in my book.
* It is trivial for a dApp to use data points from multiple oracle pools in a single tx. Allows for more complex DeFi dApps to come about while still being reasonably priced.

*More explanation at the end, in sources ""Oracle pool.""*

For Cardano, this will mean access to more layers of data availability, veracity, and completeness, all available to programmers on the Cardano blockchain directly from Ergo Oracles through an API.

**This feature will probably be required by the most sensitive applications that need a high degree of assurance that we can trust the external data to execute some code with high value at risk.** And the most sensitive apps and dApps will also probably be the most lucrative ones as they will need the highest degree of assurance they can get.

Thanks to the hard work being put into interoperability between the UTXO Alliance programmers will also have the choice between

* Having their smart contract on Cardano or Ergo and easily switch between them.
* Having one part on Cardano because some part of the execution needs something PoS is best at providing (governance, for example). Another aspect of the smart contract logic on Ergo is that Ergo offers some other unique capabilities like privacy derived from the mathematical specificities of PoW.

This way, Cardano and Ergo, together, will provide the best of both worlds.

64,CryptoCurrency,Far-Pie-4360,A deep dive on the team behind the Nervos Network &amp; CKB (Common Knowledge Base) In this post we will take a brief look at some of the team behind the Nervos Network,"*Nervos: Meet the Team Behind the Project*

As Nervos has gained recognition, people often ask about the team. Here is some background on the core team members — those who have played an outsized part in shaping Nervos.

*Jan Xie: Lead Architect and Researcher*

Jan has become a thought leader in the blockchain space through his skill and his participation in successful projects, most famously Ethereum, where he was a core researcher and developer. He was also a co-founder of ethfans.org, and an architect at Peatio. In addition, he founded the blockchain infrastructure company Cryptape.

Passionate about blockchain’s potential, Jan believes “its greatest power lies not in processing transactions but in storing value. Network functions should be spread across different layers or components. Rather than coupling all functions into a single unit, slowing transaction throughput to a crawl, developers should process these activities on a secondary layer, leaving the base layer of the blockchain to store only the value of assets. This achieves speed and scalability while preserving decentralization and security for the crucial function of the blockchain: the store of value.”


*Kevin Wang: Researcher, Token Economics*

Kevin has held key roles throughout the technology space as a consultant and engineer. He previously worked on enterprise data solutions at IBM Silicon Valley Lab. He also co-founded Launch School, an online school for software engineers. At Nervos, Kevin focuses on token economic research, and has been a driving force behind our unique approach.

“We believe that a well-designed economic model should go beyond the consensus process and ensure the long-term sustainability of the protocol as well,” Kevin says. “in particular, the economic model should have a sustainable way to raise revenue to compensate service providers (typically miners or validators) and to maintain a low barrier to participation, ensuring that the network remains decentralized over time.” Kevin believes strongly that a “blockchain’s native token must have convincing intrinsic value.”

*Terry Tai: Jack-of-all-Trades*

Terry has been involved in software development since he graduated university in 2009. He got involved in blockchain in 2014 when he became a core developer at Yunbi / Peatio cryptocurrency exchange. Subsequently, he co-founded Teahour.fm, one of China’s most popular tech podcasts. He joined Cryptape — the largest and most recognized blockchain engineering team in China — as Chief Product Officer in 2017 before leaving to co-found Nervos.

Terry explains: “Nervos is a paradigm shift. Our Cell Model for decentralized applications will make development more flexible, more scalable, and more accessible to real businesses.”

*Daniel Lv: Community Building*

At Nervos, Daniel focuses on community, leading our growth in China and internationally.
Daniel has co-founded several successful blockchain companies. He is the co-founder and former CTO of imToken, the world’s most popular Ethereum wallet and former CTO of Yunbi. As a Rubyist, Daniel organized the Ruby China community for 10 years and co-founded ruby-china.org.

Daniel is also the host of the podcast Teahour.fm. Crucially, this is where it all started back in 2013, when the Nervos core team met and bonded over a shared vision of new technology and a new economy.

It is perhaps ironic that while technological networks can be designed to be trustless, human networks require trust. This first meeting began a long relationship of trust among our founders, which ultimately set us on the path to where we are now.

*Team Vision, Team Effort*

We are lucky at Nervos to be led by these talented and passionate individuals. Ultimately, Nervos is a full team effort, and everyone in the organization — as well as our community — has an active part in our growth and success.
While we are building a complex technological system with the capability to positively reshape our financial infrastructure, fundamentally, we are a team of people pulling together to make big things happen.

On my second week on this completely new world to me. Still very much reading and learning. Something I can not quite understand. Wondered others thoughts. I have had shares before you buy at x and sell at y profit. I opened a small crypto portfolio with 9 coins £650 investment Iv watched over the last two weeks go up to £762 and back to £630 with different coins pushing this, to understand and see how things go. 

What do people generally do when it goes up?

Do you simply hold? Continue to dollar cost weekly monthly etc and sell when happy ?

I had considered taking the £110 gain and then leaving the portfolio alone again and see how it goes, 

If I wanted to take the gain what is what practise ? Do I simply sell of a little of each coin to fiat? (But then I guess I’d be only putting it back in next month anyways) 

Just curious on peoples general views?

82,CryptoCurrency,dragondude4,"Since we’re near ATHs and lot of newbies are entering the market and this sub, here’s TOKENOMICS 101: How not to get rekt by shitcoins.","Tokenomics (token economics) are a series of metrics relating to a cryptocurrency such as supply, allocation, distribution, emission, and utility. In this post I will break down some of the most important things you should know while you DYOR. Tokenomics is the difference between making sound crypto investments vs yoloing into scamcoins or memecoins.    These are the basic things to look out for during your research. 


## Circulating and Maximum Supply 

This is one of the most important metrics to when evaluating a coins price. Circulating supply is the amount of coins that’s currently in public hands and circulating in the market. Maximum supply is the total number of coins that will ever exist for a cryptocurrency. There won’t be any more supply once a coin reaches its max supply cap as it is the maximum amount that can ever be mined or produced. For example, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million and about 18 million of that is currently circulating, whereas DOGE has a whopping current supply of 128 billion and no hard cap.

## Inflation and Deflation

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have a maximum supply of 21 million. This makes it scarce and as demand for it increases, the price will subsequently increase. There are coins that don’t have any cap on the maximum supply (e.g. Ethereum, DOGE). These are inflationary which means new coins are continuously minted and an equivalent increase in demand is required to match the increasing supply to maintain the price. For example, every 10 minutes 6.25 Bitcoin are mined and this keeps halving until the max cap is reached. In contrast, every 1 minute 10,000 DOGE is mined and there will never be a cap. 

## Market capitalization (or market cap)

Market capitalization (or market cap) is the total dollar value of all the the coins of a cryptocurrency that have been mined. It is calculated by multiplying the circulating supply by the price of a single coin at any given time. Investors use market cap to tell a more complete story than simply the price and compare value across cryptocurrencies. As a key statistic, it can indicate the volatility and growth potential of a cryptocurrency. Using supply and market cap we can judge what the price of a cryptocurrency can be relative to other ones. This is why some coins have various different prices even if they might have similar market caps. For example, if DOGE had the same market cap as Bitcoin (1.1 trillion) it would be worth only $7.98. However that is a massive upside of 2800% or 28x. Comparatively if Ethereum had the same market cap as Bitcoin, its price would be at $8.9k which is an upside of 290%. Basically, the larger the marketcap of a coin is, the more difficult it is to increase in price. You can view these calculations and comparisons easily [on this website - The Coin Perspective ](https://thecoinperspective.com/). 

## Allocation and Distribution

Cryptocurrencies are created in two ways: by fair launch, or by pre-mine. A fair launch is when a small community of people start collectively mining a coin or token. Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are examples of fair launched cryptocurrencies. There are no coin or token allocations for fair launch crypto. A pre-mine is when the team behind the project mint some or all of the coins or tokens before opening up the network to the public. It’s common for pre-mined tokens to be allocated to the team and private investors such as venture capital firms with only a small percentage being sold to the public. Uneven distribution of coins is a risk factor as large holders can dump on the market and crash the price.

## Vesting and Emission

Vesting applies to pre-mined cryptocurrencies and refers to how the coins or tokens are expected to be allocated over the coming months or years. There are also vesting schedules for when the founders or insiders of a crypto project are allowed to sell their coins to the market. You can check the vesting schedules of most cryptocurrencies on their respective websites. Unlocking or minting too many tokens at once or within a short timeframe can sink the price action of that token in the short term.  

## Utility

‘Utility’ is referred to as a use case and includes basically anything that drives demand for a cryptocurrency coin or token. For example, ETH is used for gas to power the Ethereum network. Basically more utility = more demand, which means price goes up. When you stake a cryptocurrency as a validator or a delegator, those coins or tokens are usually locked up for some period of time. This can supercharge positive price action during a parabolic run.

tl;dr - These are, in my opinion, the bare minimum to look into before investing in any coin. Ideally, you want a deflationary coin with a max supply that had a fair launch or has a good vesting schedule that does not allow founders/whales to dump on the market and is distributed relatively equitably.

I would probably use them on ETH as well as some L2s, all through Metamask.What do you have to do with each of these wallets to use them e.g. on arbitrum/polygon?Is changing the network in metamask enough or do you also need to change some app on the ledger/trezor?

Afaik Trezor doesn't yet support EIP-712, which could be a problem for some Defi applications (e.g. DAI permit function, some NFTs,...).

Ledger supports EIP712, but isn't fully open-source and many nano X that are shipped right now seem to have some battery drain problems according to the ledger wallet subreddit

Social media platform Reddit appears to be hiring workers to support the design, build, and maintenance of a nonfungible token platform.


At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. It is worth noting that other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs",1634937673,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdqlbe/reddit_own_nft/

He sure knows how to open the vault. He just does not want to and there might a some reasons why so:

1) Moons are a centralized token (he is a strong supporter for decentralization)

2) Pre-mined tokens issued by a company

minor reason 3 ) He is wealthy already (most nobel billionaire, donated a lot of money to charity)

4) Does want others to know what and how much coins he owns (except for ETH of course). (Moons count are displayed next to name, experienced crypto people know that you never should reveal how much you own)

5) He is humble, he doesn't need more.

BASIC FORMULA.  I assume like with stocks, when a coin's market cap goes up 3%, pretty close to 1% the value of the previous price has flowed into the coin. (If it was worth 1 million, and someone bought $30K worth, it would now be worth $1.03 million.) \[PS I think with stocks, I think non-circulating supply is negligibly small.\]

but when you factor in the non-circulating supply, I can't tell what the deal is. SHIB, for example has a market cap of 11.0 billion circulating. but 28 billion total (that's another 17 billion non-circulating.) so, I think the ""BASIC FORMULA"" in the paragraph above would be not really apply.

25,CryptoCurrency,GabeSter,(Unpopular Opinion) None of you actually know what Novi is or have legit reasons why it would be bad for crypto.,"**What is Novi?**

Novi was announced Tuesday - it is essentially a ""money transferring service"" using a stablecoin, Pax Dollar (USDP) available in Guatemala and the US (via waitlist?). This isn't related to a stablecoin that FB was going to release DIEM and it looks like USDP is the only thing that can currently be transferred through this service.

Their platform currently doesn't have any fees to purchase or send PAXD. Meaning if you buy and send $100 they'll get $100 and can convert it to their local currency or keep the crypto. If I had to guess I'd assume this part is promotional and they'll add fees at another date as adoption increases.

The website is [here](https://www.novi.com/how-it-works) \- In case you want to look at it further.

\---------------------------------------

**Lets talk critically**

Seeing as this isn't related to a FB stablecoin - I'm not entirely sure the hate is warranted - If they ever increase the number of cryptos available to buy/send through them - that would probably be good for crypto adoption as well.

If that were to ever happen that would make Novi similar to other crypto exchanges with the added benefit of making it easy to send people in ""your FB/IG circle"" (unsure if this is a feature but I'm sure they'd try to implement something like that - long term) - **EDIT:** assuming it also has a wallet feature where you can send/recieve

\--------

Sure you could argue it centralizes cryptocurrency which is contrary to crypto - but I'd counterargue most people don't want to take the time/energy to learn DEFI for a truly decentralized use. In any case almost any adoption for crypto is good adoption, right?

I'm sure you could also try and argue this is a first step towards DIEM which nobody but FB wants and has no counterargument to my knowledge.

\---------

With all that being said I haven't really seen any valid arguments as to why this service as a whole would be bad - it's just the anti FB circlejerk. What are some actual reasons why FB running a company like Novi, make this money transferring service bad for crypto?

I welcome any and all critical feedback as to why Novi would be bad for crypto, and the ""F\*\*\* Facebook"" moon farms that will span alike.",1634936915,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdqbz8/unpopular_opinion_none_of_you_actually_know_what/

29,CryptoCurrency,mperera55,SAITAMA looking solid,"I have been searching around and reading up on various cryptos for the next 'big thing' and after going over the whitepapers and motivations of dozens of them, I personally feel that **$SAITAMA** has what it takes to be exactly that. Also with their Saitamask platform being just on the horizon, I have a feeling its gonna break straight for the **MOON!** 

**Saitamask** will make it much easier for investors to get in making this much more accessible compared to the other Altcoins ones it launches. Also it has a capped supply, with 2% burn factor and coin redistribution among existing HODLers making it's dynamics similar to all the major coins including ETH, SOL etc. It's already had over 49% supply burnt and the remaining supply is diminishing fast leaving the early adopters of this with front row seats as it takes off straight through the **STRATOSPHERE!**  
Saitama introduces itself as "" To educate the next generation of investors and make financial well-being accessible to all."" and has devised mechanisms to deliver exactly that. It's anti-whale manipulation techniques makes it relatively safe from manipulation by big players which often lead to us being left as bag holders while the ultra rich profit off of us.   Further their planned initiatives of creating its own NFT platform, makes it powerful along the same lines as SOL. SaitaMarket and SaitaEdutainment put transactional market dynamics and content at the heart of crypto make this coin actually mean something rather than just being a run of the mill altcoin.

A lot of people have asked me on how to buy this. Presently the way to buy this is through Uniswap, a step by step instruction for that is available at: [https://saitamatoken.com/](https://saitamatoken.com/)  
You can click the buy button and it will walk you through the steps (in a nutshell, buy ETH on Binance, coinbase or any exchange, and transfer it to a wallet like trustwallet where you can swap it for SAITAMA using uniswap). After the launch of Saitamask this process could be directly done by linking your bank and buying SAITAMA directly, but you risk missing out on all the gains of when Saitamask platform is launched. So my recommendation will be to get in now. Feel free to message me if you need help buying.

It's already 5x ed my initial investment and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.

Let me introduce you to our project called CoinDayOne.

Many of us are looking for new tokens to be early, but most of them are scams.

Let's take the example of BSC, I see countless scams but I also see many people investing and getting robbed easily.

That's why we are here, our website will list all new tokens but with a high trust score.

**What will be the process?**

1- Our robot check, I can't tell you in detail what it does exactly so as not to give ideas to scammers.

if it's OK

2- The contract and the token will be examined by a member of the CoinDayOne team.

if it's OK

3- If the token passes the first two checks, it will then be presented to the CoinDayOne community, and they will make the last check with a vote.

So if the 3 steps are validated then it will be listed on our website and on our social networks.

I don't know exactly how other listing websites proceed, but I've already seen scam on them, and they are big listing websites, they don't seem to do any checks!

The tokens that won't validate the verifications will be on another page ""scam list"" with a SCAM mention.

So as soon as you see an ad for a token, you can come and see on CoinDayOne if it is listed or not, or if it is in the scam list.

**A release date ?**

The release date will be given when we have at least 1000 followers on Twitter and 500 members on our Discord server, because without a minimum of community we will not be able to validate step 3 of the verifications.

Do you simply hold? Continue to dollar cost weekly monthly etc and sell when happy ?

The average person does not want to be or care to learn how to be accountable for securing one’s wallet and private key. Then the idea of having your brokage and Crypto investments all on the same place is likely very appealing to the average person. The average person probably just wants to buy, see numbers go up, then sell... and Robinhood despite their shady platforms provides this and has an appeal to the average person.

66,CryptoCurrency,Mk3supra,What legit cryptocurrency coin has the highest staking rewards?,"I've been in the cryptocurrency space since 2017 and to date I haven't sold any of my coins. I believe I have a fairly well diversified portfolio. I hold the two big boys and five or so other altcoins that I believe will grow substantially in the coming years. I'm a long-term holder with no intentions of selling for at minimum 5 years but likely more like 10 or 15 years. I invest in crypto monthly.

I received my bonus from work and I'm looking to invest a portion of it in to cryptocurrency on top of my regular monthly investment.  

I would like to invest $5,000 into a legit coin that has the highest staking rewards possible without putting myself into a rug pull type situation.

Since it sometimes is only 10 dollars, I don't want to send it to a hardware wallet because of the gas fees. When it is going to be worth a lot, I will of course transfer it but not now. Especially because ETH has high gas fees and most of these coins are ERC20. But BEP20 also have kind of high gas fees in comparison to 10 dollars.

These additional investors that come, because cryptocurrency‘s become more and more established and „trustable“ (because let’s be honest, most people have no idea how it works and thus don’t really believe in it, but as you can now trade it on official stock exchanges, despite its being futures, they might trust it more).

29,CryptoCurrency,BakedPotato840,"Why Ethereum Could Hit $20,000 In The Next 3-6 Months","With Ethereum following the 2013-2017 Bitcoin price rally with uncanny similarity and higher historic volatility due to a lower market cap, I believe $20,000 Ethereum within the next 6 months is a very real possibility. However, regulatory headwinds and smart contract competitors are factors that may prevent this from happening. 

 

Why do I focus on Bitcoin price cycle indicators in an Ethereum article? Because the Bitcoin price cycle is the crypto price cycle. The first chart below shows the 60-day correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2018. This metric tends to remain above the 0.7 level and has not dipped below 0.5 in three years. The assets are almost perfectly correlated. The second chart shows long-term price movements in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a popular altcoin, ChainLink. All digital assets follow Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model without any fundamental reason for doing so. Ethereum and ChainLink do not have Bitcoin's halving model. This correlation may break one day, but for now, it is clear. Bitcoin is the rising tide that lifts all boats.

(Source: Ibid.)

&amp;#x200B;

 I have a target end date for this crypto bull market cycle between December 2021 and March 2022. I also still believe that Bitcoin will reach six figures per coin in that time period. Analyzing the technical indicators mentioned above and on-chain indicators for exchange flows, liquid supply, and long-term versus short-term holders will give insight into market conditions. I do not subscribe to the supercycle thesis which claims that Bitcoin will not enter a bear market due to institutional adoption, especially given the fact that crypto already witnessed a 50%+ correction earlier this year. Even though I am very bullish on Bitcoin over the next 3-6 months, I believe Ethereum should outperform during this period. 

 

## Why Ethereum Should Outperform

Firstly, Ethereum is more volatile than Bitcoin due to its smaller market cap. In an average year, Ethereum’s standard deviation of annualized returns will be 10% higher than Bitcoin’s according to the [CFTC](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/Events/opaeventtac071620). Historically, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin during bull markets and underperformed during bear markets. I do not believe that will change this cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

Raoul Pal of Global Macro Investor and Real Vision is credited with noting the eerie similarity between the current Ethereum price and the Bitcoin price cycle of 2013-2017. The framework is simple and the chart speaks for itself. Ethereum is one market cycle behind Bitcoin. If this framework holds true, Ethereum could reach a cycle high of roughly $19,683. 

&amp;#x200B;

This framework has Ethereum outperforming even the most optimistic Bitcoin price targets. PlanB’s stock-to-flow cross asset model has a Bitcoin target price of [$288,000](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/bitcoin-stock-to-flow-cross-asset-model-50d260feed12) by cycle end. This constitutes a 4.36x increase from current prices. Pal’s Ethereum model constitutes a 4.77x increase and matches the CFTCs study regarding a 10% volatility difference. Even though I personally believe that these price targets are overly optimistic, my base case is Ethereum quadrupling by the end of March 2022. 

 

## Conclusion

The crypto market is entering the exuberant stage of the four-year price cycle. Now is not the time to take leverage given the likelihood of sharp, double-digit pullbacks. However, it is also not the time to sell early. If this plays out similar to previous price cycles, I believe Ethereum will near $20,000 in the next 3-6 months.",1634933435,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdp6md/why_ethereum_could_hit_20000_in_the_next_36_months/

34,CryptoCurrency,hunt_stevenson,Best Crypto strategy to balance long-term with short-term goals?,"I have some initial seed money and now DCA purchases setup for both ETH and BTC. I am limited in what I can spend just like many of you, so I really can't make large buys on the stable coins what have a high price. I am counting on the small seeds combined with the DCA over time to be there for me in a decade or more. 

So I am now trying to focus on two things, lower cost coins that I think may go up in the long run (considering those to be just like the BTC &amp; ETH I have, except I could sell them at any time if they hit well or if I just need the money).

So that leaves me with being willing to take an even smaller amount of money and try and play the emerging, small cap coins. 

I am new at this; I have know about crypto for years but I never wanted to look into it with all the other things in life going on, but I finally decided earlier this year it was time. 

Goals 

\- Have a nest egg for retirement (already have 401k-type account but haven't managed it well so I need to make up some ground with crypto)

\- Create passive or sudden income to use to improve quality of life, home improvements, hobbies, etc.

What are you all doing and what do you recommend based on what I've said. Is there a ratio of how much to re-invest verses take out of the market as income or put into an interest-bearing cash account, etc.? 

Is passive income strategy better than trying to make money trading?

I have missed the crypto train \[sob\]. I used to have $600 back in 2015 and was suggested to buy BTC by my friends. Sadly I decided to by a new laptop instead (which broke years ago). Today, I have found some rather interesting deal. The sad part is that I am going to miss it again because I am too poor to afford the starting bid prices but I am just sharing in case someone in the sub might be interested. 

There is this website called **GSA Auctions**. It is an Auctions Website which specializes in selling Proprietary surplus, Government obsolete properties, as well as seized items from police. It is like a giant thrift shop online and most listing offerings are based in USA. I have used the site for several months now and its a goldmine! You'll find dirt cheap stuff (in my case, printer toner in new packaging) everywhere although you have to plan the shipping of the items because they don't ship to your doorstep.

Today is rather curious because I discovered that THEY ARE NOW SELLING BTC which I'm going to assume that these are seized assets from some shady criminal somewhere.

That's according to [job listings posted on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2706805052). It doesn’t sound like a small operation.

“Our team is a new and exciting, rapidly growing team that aims to build the largest creator economy on the internet, powered by independent creators, digital goods, and NFTs,” the listing reads. “We are looking for strong engineers and leaders to help us seed the team, set its strategy, and build for the future. If you ask us, the NFT movement has only just begun, so come and join our team to get started.”

Reddit did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

Reddit would be the latest social media platform to more closely tie itself to crypto and NFTs.

“We’re designing for social engagement. By fostering connections, Coinbase NFT will help creators, collectors, and fans build community,” a blog post announcing the platform read.

No for ETH. Great blockchain with a community which is reshaping the world in many ways . The part that I don’t like is that arguably the biggest player in the ETH space is Consensys. They do a lot of the development and brought us things like metamask. You guys realize that they took $65 million from JP MORGAN ?! They’ve sold out. I don’t like that these people are involved with my mobile wallet and who knows what else. 

What do both these chains have in common? A bias towards people who already have money.

46,CryptoCurrency,_DEDSEC_,Opinion: Crypto Exchanges should be called Crypto Banks.,"Back in when crypto currencies first came into existence, Crypto Exchanges made sense, people could exchange their fiat for Crypto Currencies but now they offer a variety of other features than just exchanging currencies.

Why we should call crypto exchange as Crypto Banks:

• They offer similar services to banks such as Lending, savings, and even Visa/Master cards to spend your crypto.

• The name factor offers Crypto a sort of legitimacy where financial institutions may no longer think Crypto of a just a novice idea.

• Crypto Banks licences can do a lot more stuff than what exchanges licences offer, with added security and regulations which may exchanges lack.

• Crypto Banks sound cooler.",1634928724,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdnlbh/opinion_crypto_exchanges_should_be_called_crypto/

49,CryptoCurrency,velvetblunder,Bitcoin (BTC) Timeline just from 2020 is so Amazing. 825% Growth from 2020.,"2020
In January Bitcoin traded at $7200  

In March it was down by 30% and traded at $5000 (People who bought it at 5000 I am jealous xD).  
In May it was Bitcoin halving &amp; BTC price soar to $9800$
By the year end it traded $29000 (yes that's just insane)  
So it saw a growth of 300% just in year 2020.

2021:
2021 was best year for BTC.  
In January itself it touched $40k.  
In February it crossed $50k mark(Elon Musk also shown keen interest in Crypto and tweeted his opinion around it)  
In April BTC recorded ATH at $64k  
a really amazing time or it was silence before the storm  
In May BTC crashed by 50% (China's Ban, Tesla not accepting BTC, FUD)
In September it rose again to $50k in span of 3 month it mostly recovered from crash.
In October BTC recorded next ATH of $66.5k.  

So this year BTC growth is 60% till October
And from start of 2020 BTC growth is massive 825%.  

There is huge history of BTC but even this 2 years of timeline is amazing to watch and shows what is the potential of holding a coin for long term.

51,CryptoCurrency,A_Rude_Whale,Fact: Most ‘Unpopular opinions’ are just pedantic exceptions to helpful rule-of-thumb advice.," This sub is full of beginners, including me. But were seeing more and more posts akin to:

Unpopular Opinion: Putting on warm clothes during winter isn’t always preferable!

Not to mention the comments rarely even play out substantively because we’d rather respond with dueling Opinion posts. 

1. DCA is the best strategy 
2. Don’t leverage trade
3. Don’t keep large sums on exchanges
4. Don’t use loans for investing

Please understand this kind of advice is mostly aimed at wide-eyed newcomers. We understand there are exceptions as the alternatives obviously exist for a reason. 

But like everything in life, once you understand the risks that come with those exceptions, you are free to break them. But more importantly you are more equipped to break them responsibly. 

It could be argued that advice could be said more clearly and possibly so, Idk, but that and individual knowledge notwithstanding, general advice seems more useful to a sub with so many beginners and constant new comers than a constant and confusing stream of exceptions.

52,CryptoCurrency,UnlistedSpecimen,CoinMarketCap Airdrops Survival Guide,"We all (kinda) know CoinMarketCap: some of us love it, some of us hate it, some of us love who hates it, some of us hates who love it, but I'm digressing.

You can do almost anything on CoinMarketCap: track coin prices, reach for infos, do technical analysis, look at event calendars, join airdrops, switch it to CoinGecko, and make yourself look like you know what you're doing with crypto when your friends ask you to explain them what we're always talking about.

I'm joking: we  have no friends.

Anyway, airdrops, or rather those marketing stunts that involve sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency (or, as many call them: shitcoins). 

When the airdop starts, small amounts of the ""new virtual currency"" (wink wink) are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free (you wish) or in return for a ""small service"" (wink wink), such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency. 

It's not always the case though, expecially on CoinMarketCap, where the ""small service"" always involves to give out a lot of personal data, like links to all your social media profiles, and the request to subscribe yourself to various telegram groups, marketed as places to learn more about the ""new virtual currency"", but actually digital dens where you can easily get in touch with people publicly screaming ""hello"" or ""to the moon"" or privately wispering in your DMs ""great investment opportunities"" (or, as many call them: scams).

Now, after this big effort, one should be supposed to receive those small amounts of the ""new virtual currency"" (wink wink) in their wallets, right?

Wrong.

Nobody ever received any coin, nobody ever wrote a single sentence anywhere attesting any reward, and lots of them just lost time and dignity (in the best case scenario) or private data (in the worst).

So how to survive to CoinMarketCap Airdrops? That's what this guide is for. That's simple, just one point to remember end perfectly execute:

1) Stay away from them.

69,CryptoCurrency,Fart_Huffer_,"I noticed a thread about why people should stop complaining about taxes. Wanted to offer a counter perspective on the issue and explain why, at least in the US, people are so upset with our taxation system.","You can find the thread here:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdgiqr/maybe\_an\_actual\_unpopular\_opinion\_stop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdgiqr/maybe_an_actual_unpopular_opinion_stop/)

While OP seems to have a good point about a lot of things in the post what I find is that a lot of it is quite naïve and overly simplified. To highlight what I mean: 

"" If you hate that the rich get away with legal tax dodging, then vote. Get everyone you know to vote. Vote for the guy or gal that will keep the rich accountable. Stop voting for the ones that won't. Posting on this sub about how much you hate taxes isn't going to accomplish much. ""

The problem with taxes is how heavily it gets gobbled up by the military budget. If they cut down the military budget and reallocated that into education, healthcare, and infrastructure I wouldn't mind paying them. That's the catch though how would the military recruit without people who are desperate and poor? Who would fill the prisons? Eventually cops and prison guards would be facing mass layoffs and the prison industry would crash. Id rather my taxes pay for something that actually helps me and the society I live in opposed to maintaining a military base on every godforsaken corner of the planet. Basically I don't want my tax dollars to just maintain status quo within my society. I want tax dollars to actually improve society over time. What we've seen is the opposite, a slow and steady decline. Some might say its what the US needs to defend itself but it clearly isnt. Our budget dwarfs any other military budget on the planet. Our geography makes ground invasion virtually impossible. Its unnecessary.

A big point I always try to make when this comes up is unequal education budgets. In the US education budgets are based on local property value. Meaning even in the public school system, education is not an equal opportunity. This relates back to the idea that the entire US budgeting system is designed to maintain certain levels of crime and poverty in order to keep prisons profitable and the military stacked with new recruits. Low income areas are the main demographic that fills these roles in society. Whether it be the prison, guard, the prisoner, or the soldier.

Another major issue as someone from the US is our entire government was founded by a rebellion based on the principle of ""no taxation without representation"". However almost no one feels represented by our two party system. Even the majority of the Covid stimulus bills went to companies with billions of cash on hand. Its one of the few issues both sides of the aisle agree on but our politicians absolutely refuse to even acknowledge the issue. 

This is the point where we've come full circle back to OPs statement about voting. Vote for who? A third party with no chance in hell of winning? Vote for another faux progressive representative that's just going to turn around and line the pockets of the party donors as soon as they're elected (Im looking at you Sinema)? What if your areas heavily gerrymandered? Do you wait 12 hours in line just for the polling station to close anyway? What do you do when there are no politicians willing to even talk about topics like this publicly? No matter who you vote for they want to expand the budget, trying to reduce a major budget is media suicide. American politics are not built on policy, they are built on emotional sentiment and publicity. Dating back to the 80s the candidate that gets the most airtime always gets elected. The public voting directly on policy is out of the question to begin with in a republic.

Until there is a way to vote to simply disband both of the major parties in this country none of these issues will ever change. You can vote your little heart out and it wont do a goddamn thing.  


TLDR: If my taxes weren't going to perpetuate a militarized corporate welfare state I would have no problem paying them without complaint.",1634927654,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdn89m/i_noticed_a_thread_about_why_people_should_stop/

37,CryptoCurrency,DifficultyPlastic800,Beware Crypto.com,"Hello, I'm not very active on Reddit however the situation I have faced today has led to me making this post to warn others. I had been wrongfully locked out of my account permanently, my money is theirs without being given an opportunity to prove myself despite asking, and I will be taking the L and moving on, but not before I spread some awareness to possibly save someone else from this.

I had been with crypto.com for the past year, primarily using their staking and taking advantage of the 1% rebate on payments. I had built this false trust with crypto.com ignoring any reports about people being permanently locked out of their accounts and cheated out of their money since it sounds ridiculous and would not happen to me as I'm not doing anything suspicious, Oh boy how I found out I was wrong. Crypto.com reserves the right to permanently terminate your account without giving a reason, like most other companies however it seems like they abuse this. Suspicion is enough for them to take your account and all that money you have been staking or holding with them permanently with no explanation as to what you might've been suspect of.

Today I transferred more money into my account to buy a washing machine since the one I have has been broken for 2 weeks now, a regular transaction. Well, that was what I thought but I had my account terminated today for ""breaching terms and conditions"". This was given from the support member's ""higher-ups"" and an actual reason was not given even to him as (I quote) ""the answer that I was met with is that it is out of my paygrade to know"". I know right, the most ridiculous this I've heard in my life. Some top-secret crimes stuff I've done apparently. What is more, BS is the ""termination is permanent, all funds with it are lost"", which is another way of saying it's their money now. Their first decision was final and did not provide me an opportunity to investigate it further despite being given my total compliance to solve the issue.

All I was given was the ""terms and services"", which I have read and not broken. The line ""We reserve the right to suspend, restrict or terminate your access to any or all of our Services and to deactivate your account"" is probably in every company's ToS however I have not experienced abuse of this from any company until Crypto.com decided to do it to me.

The rebates and staking were great however at the risk of losing all of my money in a moment from some BS like this, I would rather have my funds elsewhere. You're free to do what you want however I am warning those who see this not to put all your eggs in one basket, especially with crypto.com as they can terminate your account at their convenience and after having them do that to me and take my money, I'm going to use my power to spread awareness about this. I'm not going to get my money back despite my attempts to but I can help prevent this from happening to other people, so even if you don't believe me, at least diversify so if it happens to you it isn't so bad.

41,CryptoCurrency,upremus,The reason why ETH Classic exists reads like an exciting crime and thriller book!,"The story why ETH Classic exists has all the elements of an exciting sci-fi, drama, crime, thriller book.

In this story we have the rise of a giant, a huge theft, drama and suspense on what will happen next, going back time and at the end a murder case 

# The rise of a giant

As many of you know the decentralized, open-source blockchain Ethereum was conceived in 2013.
Due its smart contract functionality the platform allowed permanent and immutable decentralized applications onto it. 

On 30 April, 2016 at 01:42:58 on Ethereum Block 1428757 The DAO, a digital decentralized autonomous organization, a form of investor-directed venture capital fund, was launched by Christoph Jentzsch.
It was a major success and already a month later DAO tokens were tradable on most major cryptocurrency exchanges and raised more than $100 million. 

# a huge theft

However still in may a group of computer scientists (Dino Mark, Vlad Zamfir, and Emin Gün Sirer), released a paper ( https://hackingdistributed.com/2016/05/27/dao-call-for-moratorium/ ) describing multiple security vulnerabilities in the project that could be exploited and warned The DAO to make critical security upgrades to fix those issues. 

They were not fixed and on June 17, 2016 the inevitable happened and The DAO was the subject of an elaborate attack.
A third of all of The DAO's funds, 3.6 million Ether (worth around $50M at the time , now ~$13,680,000,000 !) were stolen. 

Fortunately, the funds were transferred to an account subject (under the terms of the Ethereum contract) with a 28-day hold period. So they weren't really gone (yet). 

# drama and suspense on what will happen next
With that, the exhausting discussions began. 

Some argued that it was an unethical but legitimate maneuver, others that it was theft and demanded repossession of the Ether.
There were several debates. 

#  going back in time

In the end the unthinkable was decided. A hard fork was to take place in the Ethereum network to reverse the transaction and move it back in time.
But there was no consensus. 

And so the inevitable happened.
The Ethereum network was split into two separate blockchains. 

On the one hand, Ethereum (ETH), which was modified by the hard fork and which changed the transcation history, and Ethereum Classic (ETC), which was unmodified (where the theft still happened). 

# the murder case

In the end, this hard fork still didn't bring The DAO any luck. They had all the funds back, but the reputation was ruined and by September 2016, it was delisted from major cryptocurrency exchanges.

Facebook could become the one stop shop user interface for all things crypto. Imagine having a Facebook balance displayed in your countries fiat.

You could go to a liquidity pool group and search best liquidity pools. You could play games and earn money. You could browse properties and invest is any land or project across the globe. You could bet on sports games with nearly no rake from the middle man. I could crowd fund project or back startups. All in one spot, all with a simple click, all with higher returns on APY than the traditional system.  It could become Kickstarter, fandual, PayPal, robinhood, and an investment saving account combined.

Coinbase could handle all the crypto inner workings and remove the barriers to entry that currently exist.

Here's how it would work:

1. Pick any coin group 
2. Invest whatever you like into it
3. Occasionally you'll be asked about your bullish/bearish sentiment
4. When sentiment goes too far one way or another a vote will be held whether to sell
5. Optional: you can keep some stable coins in reserve and can buy in, if the crowd agrees
6. The crowd will also vote whether it's a strong or weak sell and recommend a % to sell, but you can make your own choice at that point.

Some extra features would be voting history.  Naturally the mob will make some bad decisions sometimes.  The system will track your votes and if the vote was the right decision or not (for example, if you voted to sell but then it pumps 15% afterwards, it'll dock points -- or if it indeed dumped 10% afterwards, it'll reward points)

This feature would be cool, because before you join a trading pool you can see the collective score of the traders inside of it.

2. **Moons:**"" There are two ways to get Moons: you can either shitpost on CC, or go to https://www.moonfaucet.cc/ and claim a tiny bit of free moons every day.

3. **Presearch:** https://presearch.org/ 
A search engine that pays you PST for using it.

4. **Airdrops:** Some cryptos have occasional airdrops. Basically you get crypto for holding other crypto. An example of this is BTT (you get APENFT) and TRX for which you can get BTT.

I've come to invest in you again
Because the bull market is coming 
My coins raised 15% while I was napping
And the tokens that were shilled in my brain
Still remain
Within the sound of shitcoins

Through pancakeswap I walked alone
Narrow streets of my DeFi home
I Invested in Safemoon ponzi
Held my coins with the Shib army
Then my eyes were stabbed by the flash of my iphone screen
My dollars missing 
And heard the sound of my wifes boyfriend crying

And in the r/cryptocurrency I saw
3 million members, maybe more
People shitposting without speaking
People FUDing without listening
People sharing shills and moon farming unpaired
But no one dared
Disturb the sound of poopcoins

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
My shitcoin like a cancer grows
10% slippage to go through
Financial advice that will snipe you""

81,CryptoCurrency,roymustang261,3 reasons why high gas fees are bullish for ETH," 

1. High gas fees means the network is congested and its being used (it has a high demand) which is obviously a good sign. The gas fees on other L1s are low because they're not being used as much as ETH is and they're obviously more centralized.
2. People are willing to pay high gas fees for Ethereum's security. People use other L1s mostly because they're cheap (low gas fees) but they wouldn't use them if they had high gas fees. People are willing to use Ethereum even though it has high gas fees.
3. This just proves that the 'big money' will always be on ETH. Look at the top NFT sales they're all on Ethereum and the other networks are not even close. Whales didn't flock to other L1s when gas fees skyrocketed and they probably never will because whales don't care about gas fees, they only care about the security of the network.

So in a weird way ETH being completely unusable is a good thing.

93,CryptoCurrency,baily78123,"A SIMPLE breakdown of Tezos, and why I want you to join the community 🌮🎂","Saying Tezos has exploded this year would be an understatement. Network usage has risen drastically thanks to a booming NFT culture and growing defi projects and eco-system. Smart contract calls are through the roof closing at almost 6 million for the month of September. Compared to the September from the year before is an increase of almost 4400%!

Some reasons to look into Tezos:


-Tezos is decentralized. 

- LPOS lets you delegate your XTZ directly from your wallet, letting you be in FULL control of your coins. Simply delegate your XTZ to a baker who supports the proposals you support and voila! 

- Tezos has fully functional on-chain governance, allowing it to adapt as needed, without the use of hard forks. 7 upgrades implemented so far which is a huge feat, and an 8th upgrade (hangzhou) around the corner. There is no front and center character, and since anyone can propose changes, if the Tezos Foundation were to dissappear tomorrow Tezos would still continue on its path.

- ""Tenderbake"" will soon be coming which will bring deterministic finality (1000tps), planned for the beginning of 2022. 

- Fees are dirt cheap, from my experience usually around 0.002 XTZ (Pennies) with more scaling solutions being built. 

- Tezos has no issues with sustainability as it uses Proof of Stake. The energy it takes to mint an NFT is less than what it takes to send a tweet on twitter. 

- Speaking of which, NFT's are huge on Tezos right now with projects like OBJKT, Kalamint, and especially HEN (hic et nunc) having seen amazing growth in users, delivering some of the best Art in the crypto space. Tezos has the 2nd biggest decentralized NFT community! With arguably the best art in the crypto space.

- If you are a fan of Ethereum like myself, theres a protocol named WRAP that allows you to WRAP your ERC-20 tokens onto the Tezos blockchain (WWBTC, WWETH, WLINK, WAAVE, etc), Which you can then use in defi to earn high APY on your assets. 

- Speaking of Defi If you are into yield farming Tezos has some great opportunities, I currently use Plenty which has recently been listed on both Coingecko and CMM. If youre interested APR's have ranged from 120%-300% for a while now. 

- Very good community focused on building and helping newcomers. 

- Tezos has HUGE partnerships with big EURO banks, F1 racing, Redbull, Ubisoft, Real estate firms, etc. Its truly crazy how many Institutions are adopting Tezos, at only a $6b market cap!! 

- Play to earn games are also gaining a lot of traction on Tezos with some really cool games being developed right now.

- Lastly Tezos is focused on Modular technology, The same blockchain architecture as ETH, which is arguably the best blockchain architecture. (Rollups, data sharding, etc.) 

To wrap things up Tezos has a very bright future ahead of it. Decentralization and its on-chain, secure and fast upgrades will keep it ahead of the pack for the foreseeable future. Tezos is built to last.

Thanks for reading, I hope to see you start delegating some XTZ and vote in upcoming protocol changes! Im sure I can speak for most of the Tezos community when I say we'd love to have you on-board! 🤓",1634918055,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdjvs7/a_simple_breakdown_of_tezos_and_why_i_want_you_to/

My current belief is that making this game into a blockchain \\ NFT game is where the REAL money is at. The unique items that could be obtained by the players is something unlike anything out there today.

I routinely have 20-30 people playing (for almost free).

The thought is to create quests (Sit and goes), big events with bosses, loot boxes, treasure, everything you can imagine in an MMO but combined with poker. I already have Kings, Possessions, Minion Poker (Unique games that I created) with a big fantasy feel.

2,CryptoCurrency,NoelPhD2024,"To those who did not see this pullback coming, have you ever looked at a chart before?","A pullback or price correction is one of if not the most common price action after an asset reaches an ATH or just pumps for a while. It is almost guaranteed to occur.  This happens for a few reasons (this list is not exhaustive) :

1. Profit taking. Believe it or not, people actually take out profits or their original investments after an ATH is reached or profit is made in general.
2. Fear. An ATH is called an ATH because it is the first time an asset has reached that price and that is the highest price it has ever reached. Some fear that it will not continue to rise after it reaches an ATH is normal
3. Whale manipulation. Whales love to sell at ATH to manipulate the price. A whale could buy 1k bitcoins at 62k, sell those same 1k coins at ATH 65K. If the  buying volume is low enough, this could significantly affect the price of the asset, causing a dip to below where they originally bought in. The dip then sends the first 2 reasons I mentioned into action by other traders. Then the whale buys in at much lower price.

So don't always freak out when green days are followed by red days. If the asset you are investing in is a decent project, there is probably no need to fear.",1634917663,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdjr31/to_those_who_did_not_see_this_pullback_coming/
9,CryptoCurrency,SouthRye,One of the leading upcoming DEX's from Cardano - Maladex - Has just released their whitepaper and it provides a very good write up on the benefits of EUTXO vs. Ethereums Global-Shared State model. Platform will allow double ROI from simultaneous POS / Yield + On-Chain Options trading!,"See here: [https://docs.maladex.com/whitepaper.pdf](https://docs.maladex.com/whitepaper.pdf)

It includes a comprehensive overview of their solution and the benefit of Cardano EUTXO model VS Ethereum + other global shared state chains

 **2.10 Cardano Blockchain &amp; EUTxO Model Cardano offers 3 major innovations making many of the ambitious goals outlined in this paper achievable, where it was not possible before on global-shared state blockchains:** 

&gt;• Smart contracts are composed of on-chain validators and off-chain code; on-chain validators provide the same level of assurance as any other blockchain model, but at the same time Turing-complete off-chain code, written in Haskell, enables performing complex and resource-consuming computation without any impact on transaction cost; this is revolutionary, as ideas such as programmable swaps and algorithmic  automated market maker (AAMM) would not be possible to implement without it. What’s more, on-chain validators provide full scope of smart contract security, meaning that despite the off-chain code, the entire protocol is equivalent to being fully executed on-chain as all security is achieved on-chain.  
&gt;  
&gt; • EUTxO fragmentation and redeemer model, which provides a unique method to enable many concurrent independent actions to take place in parallel across multiple protocols; for instance, given this fragmentation and desire to arbitrage with other DEXs, this can be done simply thanks to the EUTxO model and how redeemers work.   
&gt;  
&gt;• Hydra head – fast and isomorphic state channels allowing for straightforward usage of the same transaction settlement code in the local hydra head formation, allowing for significant performance improvement without incurring layer 2 software engineering cost.   
&gt;  
&gt;You will be able to stake your ADA wile simultaneously participating in DEFI adding extra yield to the users.

Users will be able to simultaneously interact with smart contracts &amp; participate in proof of stake allowing a double yield ROI from the system. Chains that involve locking of tokens / slashing during POS do not have this benefit as you are either securing the system ***OR*** interacting with SC's.

 **7.2 ADA Staking Rewards from Smart Contracts** 

&gt;The architecture of Cardano’s Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol and EUTxOs means that it is possible to delegate ADA locked into smart contracts to pools in order to earn additional yield. Maladex sees this basically as a riskless return rate r. Any capital that is not actively used or required for a specific action can be delegated and earn staking rewards. Hence, it also provides a nice benchmark for all investments. If any investment is not able to generate the revenue higher than the current Cardano network ROI, then it is not worthy of engagement in, unless it provides hedge against risk. 

**The platform will allow inherent decentralized options trading to the users**

 **12.1 Option Trading Strategies** 

&gt;We further propose composite smart contracts allowing purchase of option trading strategies. A user would select the risk and profit profile, input strategy parameters, and smart contract would automatically structure using the required composites for the strategy. This adds a new innovative way of trading and makes option trading (usually very risky to novice) available in a risk controlled manner (outlying the risk at value, the best/worst potential outcomes, and for savvy trades just allows for easy locking option strategy). We outline below a dozen of option trading strategies that we’d expect to introduce as a follow up to ability to trade options. This list should evolve in the future and additionally welcome new strategy propositions from the community as long as they’re sound and the risk is easy to understand and display  (strategies are outlined after this)

**The protocol will allow Portfolio managers and on-chain hedge funds to develop via the protocol.**

 **18 On-chain Hedge Fund** 

&gt;Maladex’s programmable swaps provide unique mechanism for implementation of on-chain hedge fund (first of its kind). Hedge fund is a pooled investment, taking advantage of sophisticated trading strategies and risk management techniques, in attempt to improve performance above the index benchmark. 

**18.1 On-Chain Portfolio Managers**

&gt; Maladex will create a market for trading strategies by enabling of publication of one’s programmable swaps and setting performance based fee, for instance 1% of all revenue generated using the strategy. PMs are going to be incentivized to create and publish trading strategies because of the performance based fee they are going to be able to earn, and platform users will be incentivized to lock funds into strategy vaults by being able to see strategies’ historical performance and PM’s ranking\[24, 27\]. All strategies will be vetted by Maladex security and quant team to ensure only high quality and secure strategies are shared with the community. Further, PMs via Maladex platform will have access to sophisticated tools such as highfrequency and quality data feeds, a backtesting platform, and a wide array of financial instruments to implement strategies, from indexes and synthetics to financial derivatives and options strategies. 

[**Maladex | Research Driven DEX on Cardano**](https://twitter.com/CardanoMaladex)

I've seen so much fud about ADA lately from people who don't have any clue how the EUTXO model works or the inner structure of Cardano - I wanted to highlight this team as they are very skilled Plutus / Haskell developers who know exactly how to take advantage of the Cardano platform and use the benefits of the EUTXO model. 

**-Cardano will not have failed transactions that charge end users anyways.**

**-You will know exactly how much you will pay for a swap and not experience slippage like Ethereum**

**-Fees on Cardano are predictable and set.**

**-The amount of hate thrown at Cardano lately on this sub is in direct relationship to it representing the best possible alternative to Ethereum.** 

These hate posts gain tons of support / upvotes from this subreddit from those who became very rich off of the first-to--market support from Ethereum and its related protocols. The also tend to put ""this is an ""unpopular opinion"" knowing full well that multiple hate posts about Cardano here are applauded and awarded multiple times over. It's a tactic to get people to upvote this ""unpopular opinion""

14,CryptoCurrency,Veridiyus,Why Bitcoin and Gold deserves a spot in your portfolio,"I always see people bash gold when compared to Bitcoin but I truly believe that both assets have a spot in ones portfolio. 

If we compare gold to other metals and Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies we can clearly see that both serve as hedge against inflation or in other words, they are both safe-haven assets. You can honestly think of precious metals as money of the past and Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general as money of the future. It is clear that Bitcoin shares properties with gold hence why it's called digital gold.

Gold has dominated as the go-to asset against inflation for hundreds of years while bitcoin was launched just over a decade ago and has only achieved a fraction of what gold has achieved, so far. But even then, Bitcoin shows no signs of stopping.

Thanks to its encrypted, decentralized system and very complicated algorithms, Bitcoin is very difficult to corrupt just like gold thanks to its established system for trading, tracking and weighing which is, lack of a better word, pristine. While Bitcoin's infrastructure to ensure its safety isn't fully fleshed out yet, I believe that it will at some point reach gold standard. Both gold and bitcoin are considered rare resources and gold has historically been used in many applications from specialized applications in electronics to luxury items and more. Bitcoin on the other hand, together with the blockchain technology, has a huge baseline value. A huge portion of the population, if not the majority, lack access to proper banking infrastructure and traditional means of finance. Bitcoin allow these people to send value anywhere they'd like for less than a fraction of what a middle man would charge you and did I mention that the transaction is near instant?  

Gold and Bitcoin have a very liquid market where fiat money can be exchanged for them or the other way around. Of course, Bitcoin is a bit faster than gold but it goes to show that gold still has a place in our society until it just doesn't. As long as gold is being used to value the market and as long as there are people who we yet have to convince that crypto is the future of finance, gold will still be used and just like bitcoin, increase in value over time thanks to its scarcity. 

It is a good idea to have a well balanced portfolio while the cryptospace is still an uncertain place. Not to mention that crypto still suffers from high volatility compared to precious metals. Either way, gold will most likely not be gone from the picture in our lifetime but so wont crypto, even after a few decades bitcoin/the cryptospace will still have more room to grow.",1634916985,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdjim5/why_bitcoin_and_gold_deserves_a_spot_in_your/

Therefore, you should always know who has your data.","I had this thoughts for a while. I am assuming this hypothesis based on several arguments. 

1. Data breaches had already affected millions of us. In my country (Malaysia), back in 2017, the data from our major telcos were stolen, and sold. We had 30 million people in our country, and data for 42 million people were allegedly stolen and sold.
2. Data breaches is inevitable, and lets assume that your data is already out there with people ready to use your data without your consent. 

Moving towards 'Data is the new gold' era, **would you voluntarily mint your personal data via NFT, and have people who wants to get/use your data pay you for a certain amount to send you messages/news-mail letters?** 

Therefore, you should know who has your data. In the event you receive a marketing call, or a scam call, you therefore know they are using it without your consent.  

I can take an example, though this is just based on what I know as of today. You could sell your personal information similar to how **NFT Event Tickets** are sold.

In this case, a digital ticket of your personal information is a programmable NFT, and you can build a royalty split which allows a profit sharing/payment system.

You can therefore creating an 'Allowed' list in your **NFT Personal Information Ticket** allotment to remember who had bought the rights to your information. Those who are not in the 'allowed' list should not be accessing or had access to your data.

The final request from support was for me to film myself running through some of these solutions, I guess to prove that I was doing it correctly. I'm in retail, so I get it that people can be difficult and a lot of the time it's the user not the hardware, but I felt that having to video myself was too far. It's a $200 dollar unit so I'm bummed that it's not going to work for me, and I get that I'm the one giving up but I think if we are going to onboard more people to self custody and make people feel comfortable storing their Crypto on these devices the support needs to do better.

I still like my Trezor one and I ordered another one as backup, so I'm not hating on Trezor but again, I think they can do better.

A new exchange-traded fund, Valkyrie Bitcoin Futures, is joining the race to attract stock-market investors looking for bitcoin exposure. But out of the gate on Friday, the ETF’s share price was tracking bitcoin lower.

&gt; The new Valkyrie fund, officially the called the Bitcoin Strategy ETF, went live on the Nasdaq under the ticker BTF when stock markets opened Friday at 9:30 a.m. ET, but [premarket trading started earlier](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/btf/pre-market-trades).  
&gt;  
&gt;After roughly an hour of trading, the stock was changing hands at $24.53, down 1.9%, according to the [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/btf).  
&gt;  
&gt; The early performance appeared to track a decline in bitcoin’s price, which was lower for the second straight day, around $61,500, after hitting an all-time high close to $67,000 earlier in the week.  
&gt;  
&gt;After months of waiting, the cryptocurrency industry is finally getting the U.S. ETFs that fund executives have long sought – as a way of attracting money from investors who want exposure to bitcoin price via the stock market. While cryptocurrency analysts says the new offerings, focused on bitcoin futures contracts, are less ideal than an ETF backed by bitcoin directly, the reception so far among investors has been overwhelming.

38,CryptoCurrency,CaLaHaPa,Chainlink FUD in the crypto community,"Warning, written on mobile so excuse formatting.

On the news of AP setting up a chainlink node yesterday, there has been a lot of FUD thrown around both on Reddit and on Twitter. I'm going to do my best to lay out the biggest concerns I've seen and my opinion on whether they're as concerning as they seem.

1 - Oracles shouldn't need a token

2 - The devs control a lot of the token supply

3 - The devs sell off tokens they own at regular intervals

4 - Gatekeeping data providers and validators

5 - PoA Vs PoS



1 - In an ideal world, yes, an oracle shouldn't need a token. Unfortunately, the best legal way to ensure that data is good quality is to financially incentivise it. This is a pretty simple and effective way to ensure that the data providers and validators aren't trying to game the system by providing poor data to allow for market manipulation or just to cause anarchy for the fun of it.

Chainlink is PoA, which makes people question why it needs its own token and it doesn't just use a stable coin or ETH. The short answer is that if a stable coin fails, then so does anything reliant on it (see issues with Tether...) and if it used ETH then it creates issues if other ecosystems want to use the oracle.


2 &amp; 3 - these 2 are kind of in the same answer. Yes the devs still own a lot of the token, however they are doing what any start-up has done since the dawn of business as we know it, they're funding the project through selling off shares in the project, in this case via tokens. 
The fact they are gradually selling off shows that it is a measured and considered approach that is extremely unlikely to be rug pull. 

Concerns over the devs having a large number of tokens should also be assured by the fact that Chainlink is PoA, this is addressed below in point 5.


4 - Chainlink requires KYC for its data. This, in my opinion, shouldn't worry anyone, the idea that the providers of data or the original sources of data are known should be something that assuages FUD, not produce it. 
This means that Chainlink will require the data providers to prove they are reputable prior to providing the data. If anyone could provide data, then an oracle providing real world data to a smart contract could be manipulated thereby defeating the point of the oracle and the contract.


5 - Chainlink is Proof of Authority, there are concerns that this makes Chainlink too centralised because, as mentioned above, it requires the data providers and validators to be known and approved based upon their reputation to provide and validate the data (for example, AP will be setting up a node to provide data and will be allowed to do so based upon the fact they have a reputation for providing that data historically), which means the pool of data providers can be restricted. Whilst this could be problematic if the data providers were manipulated to provide false data, the fact that there is monetary incentive and multiple good quality data sources mitigates this. 
Most of the data we get today is from a relatively small number of news and data sources, it's not like this will severely restrict the current data providers unless they have a bad track record for being truthful with data.

A PoS project relies on most no single entity being able to possess greater than 50% of the token supply as this would mean that they could theoretically attack the network and put it at risk of failure. Because Chainlink doesn't have a blockchain and it requires proof that you can provide the high quality data you say you can, it doesn't make sense to have PoS.

is there a way to see the value of the coins you taked in Binance Earn (mobile version)?  
I only see the quantity of staked coins, APY and estimated interest. But not the value of each individual coin. I only see the total value on top. But as I staked quite a few coins, it would be interesting to know the value of each coin. Whenever a coin gains value I have to look up every coin I have staked just to find out which of em is skyrocketing.

Isnt there an easier way for this?

40,CryptoCurrency,xMrCrash,"It was confirmed yesterday that the Houston Firefighters Pension Fund has officially become the first pension fund in the United States to purchase, and directly hold, bitcoin in their portfolio.","As many of you will remember, two public pension funds from Fairfax County in Virginia previously invested in the first two Morgan Creek Digital funds. They were the first public pension funds to allocate to the industry. These were venture funds that had approximately 15-20% invested in bitcoin.

After Fairfax, there was only one other pension fund that I’m aware of that had invested in the industry - the Municipal Employees’ Retirement System of Michigan allocated to Dan Tapiero’s 10T Holdings growth equity fund.

Each of these three public pension funds were investing in venture capital style funds, even if they had some bitcoin exposure, simply because there was no clear framework for them to safely place the digital assets directly in their portfolio. Does bitcoin go in their currency allocation? Maybe commodities? Or maybe it is digital real estate? There has been no clear answer. So venture funds made sense because everyone understood that the allocation went in the venture capital bucket.

This is all changing though. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are maturing to the point where public pension funds, along with financial institutions and corporations, are all comfortable holding the assets directly. They understand which bucket in their asset allocation to put them into. And the infrastructure is now available where institutions don’t have to worry about custody, insurance, or accounting support.

The market has matured significantly since 2018. Even with all this progress though, it is still a big moment when the very first public pension puts bitcoin on their balance sheet. Eventually every pension fund is going to do it.

The argument has always been simple. Bitcoin is a non-correlated, asymmetric asset that would allow a pension fund to make a small allocation, while still having an outsized impact on the portfolio. This was true when bitcoin was around $3,500 and it is true when bitcoin is trading around $65,000 today.

We still have a long way to go in educating public pension investment teams, their investment committee board members, and the general public who is made up of pensioneers. But we’re making great progress towards the inevitable end. Pension funds are not going to be able to fulfill their obligations, so they have to do something different.

I like our chances. The Houston Firefighters Pension Fund should get immense congratulations for their courage and conviction in this decision.",1634915957,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdj5u7/it_was_confirmed_yesterday_that_the_houston/
43,CryptoCurrency,MistaBud,Questions regarding NFT uses.,"So I think I'm starting to understand NFTs a bit better. The whole NFT image craze has soured the idea for me. But I got to thinking of alternative uses. Please read, and tell me I'm understanding the basic principle of the concept. This is not a  proof of concept, but I'm asking if my thought process is correct.

\---

Personal Information NFTs

Everyone knows that any personal information is valuable to advertising. Currently, data is mined from users, often with no consent, then sold, and then purchased by advertising giants who in turn, sell you their products. What I propose is an opt-in advertisement based NFT. Information that the token holder provides can be stored to the blockchain.

Participating websites can read the data, enabling targeted advertisements to the user based upon said data.

Basic Example

John is willing to share the following info: First Name, Age, Country, State, Sex, Hobbies, Income. So John visits a site, the site reads the blockchain, and finds his PINFT . The site then knows that John loves baseball, is a 25 year old male, and has disposable income. So it displays an advertisement for BigBobsSportsEmporium.com.

Advantages for Advertisers

They can target ads to its users that own the NFT. If the NFT can be verified on the blockchain, then the advertiser can pay per ad, and have it automatically deduct the required fees from their own wallet. Eliminates additional 3rd parties that supply the information. All verified and signed by automated contracts.

Advantages for Holders

The holder of the NFT gains the benefit of advertisements that are targeted to their needs. Part of the fees that are paid by advertisers go directly to the holder. It is a reward that is given to entice the holder to keep holding the NFT.

Benefits of developing on the Safemoon Blockchain (i know I'm gunna get hate from this part)

Safemoon Blockchain (SMBC) is chosen due to the uniqueness of reflections. In essence, SMBC entices the users to hold onto any token on that system by rewarding the user with a percentage of taxed transactions. By keeping the NFT and not removing it will give the user additional reflections. The reflections can then be sold/traded/used as fees by the user. They will keep getting reflections during the period that the NFT is held.

Fees

It is unclear if initial token generation fees would be covered by either the user or the advertiser. Cost would be minimal to either party. If user generated, they would have to pay, but they could recoup their losses by gaining the reflections, and also by the payments for advertisers. If paid by advertisers, it could possibly be expensive if users make multiple, unneeded NFTs, but zero cost to the user would encourage user participation. 

Summary

By encouraging users to hold the NFT, they will gain income for holding, and the advertisers have willing participants, who in turn buy their products. All that is needed is the NFT held by users, an application that can read the chain, and verify what data is stored, and the app/website then can request targeted ads to display. It can be done safely, securely, anonymously, and cheaply. It will reduce costs for advertisers, and also rewards holders by fees paid by advertisers.

I am not asking if this is a viable product, but is the idea itself something the blockchain tech and NFTs can do. Thoughts?",1634915824,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdj48j/questions_regarding_nft_uses/
61,CryptoCurrency,Misesofficial,Q&amp;A in Telegram group on Mises’ content solution," 

In Telegram of Mises, a discussion on decentralization started yesterday. We found it very insightful therefore we re-organized the text and share it here.

Yesterday, a community member asked a few questions on our solution towards illegal content, triggering a Q&amp;A. We found this discussion very insightful. Therefore, it will be presented to you in the following paragraphs.

Q: How does the local node determine what's illegal or not? And how do the nodes apply to those laws?

A: Nodes will comply with the laws of their home countries and will be punished if they are reported for non-compliance. And also, community members will play an important role in the governance.

Q:That's a serious risk i guess, if I try to decide to allow illegal content. Also, “People’s accounts and data are not in their own hands.” .. and Mises would solve that issue I guess.. But checking content by a node (certainly if its done manually) before it gets posted.. I think this breaks what Mises try to solve?

A: The content will not be only stored on one node, there will be a lot of nodes. If, for example, a pic violates the law where a node is located, this node will delete this pic on its storage, but not the other nodes. If user post content which is considered illegal all around the word, then it shouldn’t be public, right? And we think how a node acts depends on the people that run this node, they can also decide to accept all the content even if facing a potential legal problem. And we think this is how freedom and regulation reach the equilibrium, by game.

Q: I understand, but “the nodes think” again.. how do they “think” .. how do they check the content when its encrypted? There is no preview you said. How can the node owner decide and check what's illegal or not? so send a request to a node would require a preview of the content right, otherwise, again…. how does the node knows whats illegal?

A: The chances that your content would trigger reviewing depends on the people who run the node. Most people would not want to host content which is illegal in their resident country, but some people don’t.

We're okay JUST the fucking way we are. You too!","I hate this kind of post. It's like we're ALL stupid here, but there's that ONE guy who has figured it out and he tells us how extremely annoyed he is by us Kindergardeners. He has seen the light and like in Plato's Allegory of the cave (The philosophical thing, not the porn with Lana rhoades and Mia Khalifa) he is willing to descend down to us into the cave to free us from our chains and to educate us.

He has seen the light and brings us the news of the beautiful world he has seen, where we stop a certain behavior that he thinks is unbefitting for the likes of us. Like he has seen so much of it, that he goes out of his way and takes some time to create a post about something that we REALLY need to stop. For ... reasons. He doesn't like it mainly. That's the main reason. It's not good for crypto also. It's bad for crypto, if we behave like that. And all the while he angrily slaps his pc with a wet towel and screams at birds that fly by.  


But we're not better. We all flock to this kind of post and MANY of us address criticism like it's always a good thing. Like the person criticizing actually has a point and not crayons in his ass. What drives us and gives us a wrong motiviation to do so, is our need to be smart and understanding and willing to change. Up to a point where no change is required. Because we think, being like that makes us better traders or hodlers.  


But remember this: The complaining person has thought about this vor a while! He's slept his PC many many times and came up with arguments, why we should stop a certain behavior. Some of them arguments are not even bad. Which means, we'll be impressed and immediatelly think: ""That's one smart guy! He certainly is hung and has lots of Cryptos."" But if we stop for a moment and think about Counter-Arguments, there almost always are! And often there are very good reasons why we behave like we do.  


Keep that in mind. It's a general thing. I know this, because I have seen the light and I wanted to descend down the cave to tell you about it. So STOP listening to people who want to tell you to stop something, and who clearly think of themselves as something better!

To start earning NFTs you need to hold at least 1 Token and Play. Holding more Tokens and NFTs will increase your earnings in all aspects of the game (delve mode, tower mode and expedition claim).

1,CryptoCurrency,TryingToMakeAMil,"The holy trinity of crypto (BTC, ETH &amp; LINK)","This is the path to mainstream blockchain tech adoption.

# Problem 1:

The issue of double spending in electronic currency - a phenomenon in which a single unit of currency is spent simultaneously more than once.

**Solution**: 

Bitcoin - a decentralised community consensus mechanism, where nodes are incentivised to act honestly in order to maintain a common, universal ledger system where all the transactions are verified and recorded (blockchain).

# Problem 2: 

Now we have digital currency, but it lacks other functions such as sophisticated smart contracts that can be programmed with business logic, i.e. a bond that pays out automatically on certain dates.

**Solution**: 

Ethereum - an open source software platform based on blockchain technology that allows developers to build and run decentralised applications (dApps) using programmable smart contracts.

# Problem 3: 

Now we have a digital currency and programmable smart contracts, but for REAL world use they need to be connected to external data inputs that can trigger smart contracts, i.e. did you receive your delivery, what's the current cost of a gallon of fuel, what is the weather in a certain location AND we need to fulfil payments through legacy payment systems (VISA, MasterCard, PayPal etc.)

Chainlink - the Chainlink network provides reliable tamper-proof inputs and outputs for complex smart contracts (80% of all smart contract use case) on ANY BLOCKCHAIN using a community consensus model for verifying external data from the real world where those validating stake their own collateral (LINK token) as an incentive to act honestly.

10,CryptoCurrency,Amun-Aion,How does encryption work with data on blockchains (e.g. public ones like BTC or ETH),"So I get that putting information into a public ledger means that it is public.  However, (I'll preface this with I don't really know that much about encryption), why couldn't you just encrypt the data that you put into the blockchain?  Medical data is probably a poor example since it is so sensitive, but why couldn't you just post an encrypted version of the data, as long as you have the only key / decryption?  I've head some people talk about problems associated with storing information on the blockchain, but short of public officials/funding (e.g. things you want to be very transparent, like knowing exactly where your tax money is going), why would you want to put sensitive data on a blockchain (even if the blockchain wasn't public or did have privacy guarantees)?  I get not wanting everyone to know your wallet balance and full financial history, but in terms of putting personal data or something on the blockchain, is this essentially just another storage mechanism? I don't understand why you would want to put something onto a blockchain that you don't want other people knowing.  The only reason I could think of is that the blockchain acts as a kind of ""cloud"" where you can push your information from your machine and access it from any other machine in the world, given you have your private key still.

Sometimes I hear about public-private key cryptography or multi-sig / additive cryptography is other contexts, but it's never been clear to me why you couldn't encrypt information and then push that to the blockchain (I'm not even sure how that encrypted data would appear to be fair).",1634913527,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdibl3/how_does_encryption_work_with_data_on_blockchains/
12,CryptoCurrency,lwc-wtang12,I've tried to use Ethereum 10-15 times over the last year for basic swaps and it is utterly unusable in every possible way,"Recently I wanted to try to swap out my Uni for Sol. To do this I needed to make sure enough eth was in the Uni address to be able to pay the gas fee (there wasn't. TX 1 - ridiculous gas fee). 

Then I need to send Uni from HW wallet to metamask or something similar (TX 2 - ridiculous gas fee). 

Then I need to swap Uni for a stablecoin (TX 3 - ridiculous gas fee). 

Then you need to convert an erc20 stablecoin to a version that works on the Sol chain (TX 4 - ridiculous gas fee). 

But oh wait you don't have enough Eth in your wallet now to do the conversion because you spent well over $100 on the four TXs leading up to this so you must send another $60 of eth again. But you should actually send $120 because that transaction will have huge gas fees too...... (TX 5 - ridiculous gas fee). At this point I gave up on the whole thing. I'm not trying to dump hundreds of dollars of Eth just to swap Uni for Sol. (The process of switching a stablecoin from ERC20 to a different chain is also a convoluted nightmare but that was expected). 

I have a bag of eth locked away simply as an investment and with the hope that eth 2 is somewhere on the horizon but good god it is not a usable system in any sense of the word usable. And yeah yeah ""use layer 2."" I've heard it 100 times but it still costs an arm and a leg to get in and out of layer 2. It's barely a bandaid to the underlying issue. 

For layer 2 to have been helpful here I would have needed to send Eth and Uni from one single address to metamask and then bridged to a layer 2 from there. But if your ERC20 coin isn't in the same address as your eth then you need to send eth to the address with the ERC20 so you can actually move it to metamask. All of this takes insane fees relative to the action I am trying to take.

If you own ethereum it's basically no different than having your funds locked in an escrow account unless you have like 10+ ethereum to play around with to actually be able to comfortably fund transactions without hurting your stack. Then again, regardless of how much money you have these fees are unbearable. 

To be clear, I am still a fan of Eths vision. I am not a fan of some of these new ""eth killers"" as they aren't decentralized and are backed by venture capital firms. This goes against the entire purpose and ethos of cryptocurrency in the first place to me. The only reason I was going to grab some Sol was to see if I could catch a moon shot to like $400 or something (aka greed). But perhaps this was a sign...

The only ones I genuinely care for are the ones that had fair coin distributions, have ease of participation (requirements to run a node), and are decentralized. Sol does not have any of those properties. There is a small handful of projects aiming to be what Eth is still trying to achieve that are interesting (ada, xtz, and so on). 

At the end of the day, the barrier to entry to literally all of DeFi is massive. And not just because it's expensive to use, but because it is an extremely confusing shit show to anyone above the age of 45 (unless tech-savvy) and to those that are simply not tech-savvy. The front-end user interfaces and interoperability have a LONG way to go.

33,CryptoCurrency,kalelmotoko,"Question about value of crypto currencies, exemple of shib and algo","So essentialy the **value** of a coin depend on :

\_marketing (shilling, add, rumor...)

\_good project/person which attract investor

\_use (real or promise).

&amp;#x200B;

The **limit of this value**, the market cap,  depends on the number of circulating coin.

&amp;#x200B;

If number of circulating coin increase, market cap will decrease.  On the contrary, if the  number of circulating coin decrease, the market cap will increase.

&amp;#x200B;

Circulating coin  ↗  = market cap ↘ = potential Value **↘**

Circulating coin ↘ = market cap  ↗ = potential value **↗**

&amp;#x200B;

Exemple :

The highest market cap of cryptocurrency today is the Bitcoin, which have a MC about the same value as gold, 1.2T$. If Shib have the same success as BTC, and reach his Market cap, it will be worth 0.0024$.

Compared to the current 0.000028$, it's around 8500%.

If you have 2000$ in Shib today, you will have 171 428$. Note that this is highly unlikely.

Shib can't reach value of bitcoin today, 63 761.96 $, because his market cap will be

63 761.96 x 497 730 966 630 395 (circulating supply) = 3 173630198504858e+19 , so essentialy disrupting the entire economy on earth.

&amp;#x200B;

If i do the same operations with Algo we have, in case of both those crypto reach the Market cap of BTC :

&amp;#x200B;

||BTC|SHIB|ALGO|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|circulating supply|18 850 962|497 730 966 630 395|6 150 413 887|
|actual price|63 761.96$|0.000028$|1.92$|
|potential max price||0.0024$|195.35$|
|potential max gain||8500% (x85)|10 000% (x100)|

No hate, i sold my Shiba just before the pump, and i am the governor of Algo but this is completly unbiaised and unshilled.

&amp;#x200B;

If i understand correctly, circulating supply depend of Total supply (total number of coin) minus the hold/locked coin and the burned token, and depend on mining (and halving) too.

Circulating supply = mined coin - \[ hold/locked coin + burned \]

&amp;#x200B;

Which explains the burning coin strategy of ETH for exemple.

For the the limit of the value of a coin to change, the circulating supply must change.

The possibility are :

&amp;#x200B;

|Potential value of the coin ↗|Potential value of the coin ↘|
|:-|:-|
|circulating supply ↘|circulating supply ↗|
|hold/locked coin ↗|hold/locked coin ↘|
|burned token ↗||
|halving ↗||
|mining ↗|mining ↘|

For more than half a decade, our team of researchers from all across the world has gathered data to evaluate the future success of cryptocurrencies based on a handful of key factors. Finally, we used post data from Reddit to let our extremely advanced machine learning process come up with a formula which allows us to calculate a score Φ  which predicts the future of a crypto asset. 
This score Φ ranges from 0 (dangerous scam, better tell people not to buy this coin) to 100 (potential to reach #1 rank by market cap). 

Let me first share with you the aforementioned key factors:

t := The total number of coins in circulation
p := The percentage of pre-mined coins
δ := The average daily trade volume in USD
ψ := The number of distinct contributors on GitHub
ω := 10 if supports smart contracts, 0 otherwise
μ := 0.1 if coin is in your portfolio, 0 otherwise.

However I value all of your feedback as you have been so supportive on the journey.


1. Keep a tally of my initial investment

$1,000 invested in crypto

2. When the investment trebles in size I remove one third.

$3,000 reached
Keep $2,000 in crypto
Take $1,000 and put it in motivate bank account.


3. Going forwards every time the investment doubles I take out 35% and hold this for the bear market.

$4,000 reached
Keep $3,600 in crypto
Take $1,400 and hold for bear market.

Good Value: Even though Shiba Inu coins are up 200% in the last few weeks, it is still worth less than 1 cent. Thus, there’s a low price to enter.

Ethereum: Shiba Inu is Ethereum-based, which ties it to one of the other large cryptos.

Good Fundamentals: Another benefit is that it has a healthy market cap and trading volume.

No Innovation: Sadly, the coin is not innovative. It is tied to the Dogecoin revolution and doesn’t offer any unique blockchain technology.

Competition: With so many meme coins flooding the market, Shiba Inu faces a lot of competition.

Volatility: Similar to other cryptos, Shiba Inu’s price is also volatile.

Final Thoughts: Shiba Inu, whether you buy it or not, is available on most crypto platforms.

It is inevitable that crypto bull market will eventually come to an end. It could end by the end of this year or Q1 of 2022 as it seems like the lengthening cycle  theory seems to be accurate.

The summer correction we went through is like a practice run for the crypto winter of a few years that is waiting for us at the end.

Let's say $100k per btc is the top bull market price. Do you see yourself having the stomach and mental capacity to handle seeing your portfolio drop down to 20k? Do you think you will have the conviction and courage to buy more? If you did that during 2021 summer correction, I think you will be able to handle the upcoming winter. If not, my suggestion is for you to analyze risk and benefit, set a plan to DCA out to capture some gains.

Now customers can buy BTC in store from a vending machine. They’ll still need to pay a 4% fee , open a Coinme account with KYC, and then deposit the voucher. It’s still unclear how competitive the exchange price will be. 

It’s not exactly the easiest BTC transaction around, but great for mainstream crypto and putting to rest all the crypto-is-crime FUD. 

The number if Bitcoin ATMs has doubled in a year to over 14,000  (source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/343127/number-bitcoin-atms/)

That Walmart is even considering getting on the Bitcoin bandwagon is very promising.

29,CryptoCurrency,kirtash93,Cryptotrivial contest 2021: Round 30! A mechanism used in computer security used to detect or counteract unauthorized access of information systems. | 22/10/2021,"Happy Friday!

Welcome to **Round 30 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 30: A mechanism used in computer security used to detect or counteract unauthorized access of information systems. 

The correct answer of **Round 29** is...

Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...

# Vladimir Club!

**What is** Vladimir Club**:**

The term “Vladimir Club” was first mentioned on BitcoinTalk forum in 2012 and was originally applied to Bitcoin. User Vladimir suggested that owning 1% of 1% of the max supply of Bitcoin was a good idea, and the term Vladimir Club was coined right after. Since the max supply of Bitcoin is 21,000,000 coins, anyone with more than 2,100 BTC can be considered a member of the Vladimir Club.

Back then, it was much cheaper than today to become a member of the club. In 2012, one Bitcoin was valued at about $11, which would require a person to invest $23,100 to be considered part of the Vladimir Club.

When Bitcoin price was close to $20,000, in late 2017, one would need to invest around $42,000,000 to be considered as part of the Vladimir Club. As of 2019, with Bitcoin hovering around the $4,000 mark, the threshold is around $8,400,000.Originally, it was estimated that the maximum number of club members would be 10,000 (if all coins were mined and divided equally among the members). However, as some Bitcoin holders accumulate much larger amounts than 2,100 coins, the maximum number of members is significantly smaller than that. Additionally, there is a very large number of coins that are inaccessible, either because the private keys were permanently lost or because they were sent to invalid addresses and cannot be retrieved (e.g., the genesis block address).

It is quite difficult to estimate how many members the Vladimir Club currently have because many Bitcoin holders split their funds into multiple different addresses and also because some of the richest addresses may be owned by the same person. Still, the number of members of the Vladimir Club is estimated to be somewhere between 500 and 600 people.

Since the Vladimir Club concept became more popular in the cryptocurrency community, the term is often used to refer to other cryptocurrencies, other than Bitcoin. For instance, any person owning more than 1% of 1% of the max supply of the BNB may be considered a member of the BNB Vladimir Club.Considering the max supply of BNB of 200,000,000 coins, one would need around 20,000 BNB to be considered a member of the club. If all BNB coins were equally distributed, the maximum number of members would be 10,000. However, the total supply of BNB is gradually decreasing due to the multiple coin burn events, which will be performed until the total supply is eventually reduced to 100,000,000 coins. As a result, the maximum number of BNB Vladimir Club members will decrease significantly.

Note that the max supply refers to the maximum number of coins that can ever exist (e.g., 200 million for BNB or 21 million for Bitcoin). The total supply, however, refers to the coins that were already issued and are either circulating on the open markets or locked up. While the max supply is fixed (defined when the cryptocurrency is created), the total supply may change due to burning events.

61,CryptoCurrency,zergtoshi,"Are you mining ETH, but the tx fees annoy you? Here's a solution!","If you are a small (ETH) miner and want regular payouts without paying much (BTC) or any (NANO) fees, consider joining 2miners.  
While BTC tx fees are quite low right now, this isn't guaranteed to be always the case.  
If you want to evade tx fees permanently, going for NANO payouts at [https://eth.2miners.com/](https://eth.2miners.com/) should be your choice.  
Thousands of other miners already joined 2miners because of the new payout system!  
  
Some background: almost two weeks ago (October 11, 2021) 2miners.com announced that they'd launch a [new payout system](https://2miners.com/blog/how-to-get-payouts-for-ethereum-mining-without-fees/), which allows miners to receive payouts in BTC and NANO in order to avoid ETH fees partially or altogether.  
  
Ever since that announcement the number of miners, who decided to pick one of these options, has been increasing.  
Day after day hundreds of miners join the pool and receive their mining proceeds in BTC or NANO.  
Close to 10,000 miners are currently mining ETH at 2miners and receive BTC or NANO.
  
  
Have fun!

64,CryptoCurrency,CryptoSorted,The 3 types of coins and how to invest in them,"Every cryptocurrency falls into one of these 3 categories:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Shitcoin
2. Low cap gem
3. Blue-chip coins

In this post, I'm going to share with you how to (gamble) or invest in each of them.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Shitcoins**

Shitcoins are cryptocurrencies that do not have tangible real-life use case(s). They're either created for fun (meme coins), pure speculation or to facilitate some Ponzi schemes. Popular examples of shitcoins include DOGE, SHIB, SAFEMOON, etc. By all means, I suggest you avoid ""gambling"" your money on shitcoins. 

However, if you feel that gambling on shitcoin is your calling, then here's my [shitcoin investing strategy for born degenerates](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9nohi/shitcoin_investing_strategy_for_the_born/) for you to consider adapting and using for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2. **Low cap gems**

Low cap coins are usually new, up and coming, promising cryptocurrencies with solid fundamentals. These projects have good technology, a working product, a competent and committed team, an active and growing community, real-life use cases, great tokenomics, etc. 

Their marketcap is usually within the range of $1 million to $10 billion (depending on their use case and market size) with lots of room to grow. Examples of popular low cap coins include ONE, MDX, HNT, ALGO, VET, CHZ, KCS, BAT, PRE, etc.

Some low-cap coins could be obscure and relatively lesser-known. That's why we call them ""gems"" to be discovered.

My previous post, [how to take profit like a Pro](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcmwb6/how_to_take_profit_like_a_pro/) is a good example of how to invest in low-cap coins. At least, that's what I practice. I am usually invested in low-cap for the long term but eventually, I will sell them and dump the profit in blue-chip coins, except they themselves become blue-chips.

&amp;#x200B;

3. **Blue chips**

Blue-chip coins are cryptocurrencies with an established market presence and significantly large marketcap. They're market leaders in either or both the entire industry and their respective niches.

These are the cryptocurrency version of ""too big to fail"" projects (if there's such a thing). The two major blue-chip coins are BTC, ETH. Other projects that are getting close to this status include LINK, BNB, UNI, SOL, etc.

Like low cap coins, blue chips have good technology, a working product, a competent and committed team, an active and growing community, real-life use cases, great tokenomics, etc.

They're less-risky and more stable than low-cap coins but usually offer lower potential returns. 

The ultimate investment strategy for blue-chips is to **HODL ""forever"",** staking, lending and living on the returns they generate and spending or selling them only when absolutely neccessary.

77,CryptoCurrency,hoanglpr,True betting game on blockchain - Play or Invest,"I stumped upon the project called Polyroll by an airdrop of ROLL (its native token). At first, I was kinda suspicious, because most airdrops are scam. But this one has a symbol ‘black club’ and a website. So I came check this out. Still, I was not convinced this one was real because of the pixel art. But after I read their medium articles and documentation, and actually made some bets, I put down my money.

So when it comes to betting, randomness is a key. PolyROLL uses a ‘Chainlink VRF’ every time a bet was made to ensure a randomness is secure, provably fair, and unpredictable by all participants. PolyROLL is the one that has made the most VRF calls from Chainlink (LINK).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5ax8l21rzzu71.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f47145112004c9386b345e529deb2d71f72b276b

There is no KYC required. All you need is a non-custodial wallet and some tokens like MATIC, ROLL, USDC to make a bet. Polyroll currently offers 4 games: coin flip, dice roll, Polyroll, and roulette — all of which use Chainlink VRF for verifiable randomness.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xh5duumrzzu71.png?width=1912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b52fde1ba2c34194a91e8c6be2252d003fcfafbf

So what is the use case of ROLL? There are 3 use cases as far as I know of. First, you could use it in addition to other tokens to make a bet. Second, it is used to reward in case a user is lost, which is called 'play-to-earn'. Last but not least, you could stake ROLL to earn more ROLL (92% APR as of writing) and share the house benefits. They actually have distribute the benefits on two occasions (more information in the link below):

* Round 1 (August 15th 2021), House profit to distribute: 64,000 MATIC, Reward Per Block: 0.0296 MATIC per block.
* Round 2 (October 11th 2021), House Profit: 80,624 MATIC. They buyback 4,066,804 ROLL (link), and send it back to the game contract so that maximum bet could be increased (link).

So far, this is actually a betting game that I know of works on the blockchain and actually uses a blockchain technology (Chainlink VRF). You could check every bet you made or anyone else on leaderboards. They have the best UI. Gas fee is pretty low, which makes sense when you make a small bet. The community is nice, there is no shilling request, no bullshit price speculation. More importantly, devs are listening to holders’ requests.

So the real question is if there are people playing on Polyroll? A lot! There are a lot of heavy players. Some play hundreds of thousands of MATIC. Some won thousands of MATIC. Some loss thousands of MATIC.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u41b2rrszzu71.png?width=1912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79bcfcea8a0d8493c423d6418180bdb957d57e51

So my strategy: I don’t link gambling, but because of many heavy players out there, I decided to stake my ROLL to receive more ROLL and share the house benefits via buyback or dividends.

I don’t encourage anyone to gamble, but if you want to earn some more MATIC or USDC, come check this out. More importantly, PLEASE play RESPONSIBLY with your bag. In the UK, at every bet side, there is a saying: “WHEN THE FUN STOPS, STOP!”.

The other side of the debate said that people actually want to use crypto to make some purchases, but that it's impossible to purchase normal goods online (like from Amazon) using your crypto.

All the coins in ""Biggest Gainers"" are based on the same principle, with small variations. A lot of people are falling for these scams, thinking they found the new gem. It's sad and CMC needs to remove this useless window.

88,CryptoCurrency,SoonMoonn,How is Tether (USDT) at number 4?,"**It only has 15 employees, and has a market cap of $70,000,000,000.**

The ratio of market cap to employee is 4,666,666,666 / 1 Employee. That is just absurd!

**Only a tiny amount of its market cap is actually backed by the USD**

Tether Limited as of 2017 stated that owners of tethers have no contractual right, other legal claims, or guarantee that tethers will or can be redeemed or exchanged for dollars. On 30 April 2019 Tether Limited's lawyer claimed that each tether was backed by $0.74 in cash and cash equivalents. In May 2021, Tether published a report showing that only 2.9% of Tether was backed by cash, with over 65% backed by commercial paper.

**They have been involved in lots of shady stuff, such as price manipulation**

They have already had plenty of lawsuits filed against them and even had to pay fines.

 We are The Ball Boys and its a project of a group of friends who are just regular average Joe retail investors. The goal of that project is to create a platform for retail to get DD, not just about one ticker or crypto.  We are against stock/crypto tribalism, we believe in empowering retail and we want that information to be FREE for all the Average Joe retailers out there.

We are not trying to incentivize or exploit any community. We want retail to be educated. Our goal is to use this project to talk, and hopefully educate people and ourselves on other tickers/crypto for FREE. Our mission is pretty simple, we believe in retail and we know retail can make a difference.

We appreciate any comments or feedback as we try to improve our delivery of future DD's. Thank you.",1634906373,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdg1sr/understanding_the_world_of_crypto_with_special/

14,CryptoCurrency,maki23,Crypto discriminate nobody,"  

I used to get bullied at my school. I was not able to walk and run like other kids because of my handicap. I was not brave enough to face all this bullying and I started hiding from everyone. I used to sit at one place all day in school and often made excuses to bunk class.

This kept on going for years, and finally, I dropped out of school after graduating from High School. I had no degree, and I had never acquired a skill useful to land a corporate job. I wasted my years sitting idly at home and doing nothing. I used to spend hours surfing and playing games.

My parents were worried about me. And I couldn't rely on my parents to be there for me always. I tried applying to stores if they have an available position for me but with my condition, chances were very limited. 

I did get lucky being a Call Center Agent because they do not discriminate as long as you have the voice and the willingness to learn. I am very grateful for this job and I am happy despite kowtowing to rude customers on the phone. 

Still, I needed a passive income so I can save up more money. One day while scrolling through social media, I came across the Utopia advertisement. I signed up for fun and started exploring the platform. The idea of trading cryptocurrency was appealing to me. So I instantly decided to jump in. I first started with CRP and found out that it was a very lucrative token. Now I am an early adopter of UUSD and I am loving it. I like Utopia because here, I get to stay anonymous. No one can make fun of me and I get to earn really good. The world is cruel. It is sad but true. Despite that, I feel peace and secured when I am with Utopia.

Their plan was originally to encourage more people to continue joining BitMart to continue stealing funds however as the onboarding of new users has severely slowed they are resorting to 'kicking the can down the road' by providing false promises in the hope they can attract new users and save face.

Either that or they have every intention of closing BitMart down at some point and doing a runner...much like other stories we have read about in the news regarding Cryptocurrency and exchanges.

18,CryptoCurrency,shoorik17,I bought 2000 INJ ($26k worth) today and here's why I think it's worth checking out," Obligatory \*not a financial advisor, DYOR\* disclaimer.

I recently started watching Coin Bureau's content and have been impressed with the quality of his research and picks ... you would have done very well to have invested in some of the coins that he was very bullish on over the past couple of years. This week I came across his newsletters ([https://www.coinbureau.com/newsletters/](https://www.coinbureau.com/newsletters/)) where he discloses his current holdings and noticed one that I hadn't heard of before - INJ Protocol. He last did a deepdive on them 11 months ago ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEU0rW2YELg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEU0rW2YELg)).

He doesn't hold a whole lot of coins, and has been hodling INJ for a while now, so that caught my attention and made me do my own research. Here's what I found:

**Pros:**

* **Seems to have a unique value proposition** \- I'm not so interested in any of the copycat ""the next eth2 killer"" because all they seem to boast about is that fees are cheaper and they're faster (which is easy to say at their tiny scale), I find it more interesting to buy into projects which seem to be doing something new. INJ's proposition, from my understanding, seems to be that they are not only looking to solve some of the problems DEXs (decentralized exchanges) like Uniswap have today (high fees, slow speeds, high potential for frontrunning), but they will enable anyone to build additional DEXs on top of their -protocol- to build a massive interoperable ecosystem across chains. INJ would essentially be a unique DEX as well as a platform of platforms (meaning, others can use INJ's building blocks to create new experiences to address specific use cases at the edges.. this is how open platforms and protocols scale). Some additional reading here 1) [https://academy.ivanontech.com/blog/defi-deep-dive-what-is-injective-protocol-injdefi-deep-dive-what-is-injective-protocol-inj](https://academy.ivanontech.com/blog/defi-deep-dive-what-is-injective-protocol-injdefi-deep-dive-what-is-injective-protocol-inj) 2) [https://cryptoseq.medium.com/why-injective-protocol-inj-is-an-incredible-investment-opportunity-5ea7fea97228](https://cryptoseq.medium.com/why-injective-protocol-inj-is-an-incredible-investment-opportunity-5ea7fea97228) and 3) [https://www.coinbureau.com/review/injective-protocol-inj/](https://www.coinbureau.com/review/injective-protocol-inj/)  
 
* **Employee growth** \- The coinbureau article linked above mentions 15 employees in April. On LinkedIn I am currently seeing 44 ([https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=injective%20labs&amp;origin=SWITCH\_SEARCH\_VERTICAL&amp;position=0&amp;searchId=96699792-3c69-4d9e-b848-1ac8f531b95a&amp;sid=oZY](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=injective%20labs&amp;origin=SWITCH_SEARCH_VERTICAL&amp;position=0&amp;searchId=96699792-3c69-4d9e-b848-1ac8f531b95a&amp;sid=oZY)), and LinkedIn also allows you to see who worked there previously (i.e., worked there but moved on .. which would be a negative sign): I am seeing just 5 ([https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=injective%20labs&amp;origin=FACETED\_SEARCH&amp;pastCompany=%5B%2240708618%22%5D&amp;position=0&amp;searchId=96699792-3c69-4d9e-b848-1ac8f531b95a&amp;sid=rNr](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=injective%20labs&amp;origin=FACETED_SEARCH&amp;pastCompany=%5B%2240708618%22%5D&amp;position=0&amp;searchId=96699792-3c69-4d9e-b848-1ac8f531b95a&amp;sid=rNr)) .. the most relevant seem to be 1 engineer and 1 Quant Researcher (who took a Product Manager role elsewhere), and the other 3 are less significant .. 1 internal and 2 overseas ""Community Managers""). I like the turnover and the team in general seems strong (the CTO holds a Masters from Stanford, etc).  
 
* **Quality of products and roadmap** \- There are constant announcements of partnerships/bridges and new product releases on their blog [https://blog.injectiveprotocol.com/](https://blog.injectiveprotocol.com/) . Their hub ([https://hub.injective.network/](https://hub.injective.network/)) is sleek and loads fast (can't say the same about others I've seen), and they have a good amount of helpful content on their site - [https://blog.injectiveprotocol.com/learn/](https://blog.injectiveprotocol.com/learn/). It's clear they are investing heavily into the platform and user experience. One of the INJ devs mentioned in this thread [https://np.reddit.com/r/injective/comments/q8z6jw/dead\_or\_alive/](https://np.reddit.com/r/injective/comments/q8z6jw/dead_or_alive/) some very promising upcoming product releases: decentralized oracles (Chainlink, etc), onboarding market makers and removing all trade limits. The DEX isn't fully functional yet hence very little adoption and noise, and this is why I think it is a particularly good time to get in.  
 
* **Potential for large appreciation** \- the marketcap is currenetly &lt;$500M. UniSwap's is $16B. INJ trades at just under $13 as I write this .. down from a high of $25 in April (when everything was high), and having grown 60% over the past month. I believe it can at least get back to its ATH and of course exceed it as DeFi continues with its parabolic growth and the need for cross-chain functionality.  
 
* **Lack of buzz on reddit/this sub** \- this is maybe the strongest reason why I invested; I typically get in too late and wish I had ridden the 1000% gains of the popular coins that are always mentioned in every altcoin thread on this sub. By contrast, there is very little discussion of INJ .. if you search this sub it is mentioned a very small handful of times, with very little commentary (and where it was negative, it lacked substance .. I couldn't find anyone discussing reasons why the project should fail or other shortcomings to be aware of). This one seems to be flying under the radar at least for now.. and I think Coin Bureau is due for an updated video as there have been a lot of recent releases and it is still one of the coins he is a believer in.  
 

**Cons:**

* **Investment by Binance** \- I am not a fan of Binance and was a bit worried by this one, but it appears that Binance's VC/investment arm just gave these guys money but INJ is not otherwise built on BSC (it is built on Cosmos, though there appears to be support/bridges to BSC which isn't a terrible thing since they are a massive market).  
 
* **Fully diluted marketcap of $1.3B is 3x current market cap** \- according to [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/injective-protocol/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/injective-protocol/). This has potential to drive the price down if new coins flood the market, but this ratio isn't that bad for early stage coins such as this and they are keeping some in reserve to award staking (currently 5% return) and grants for new projects, etc.  
 
* **Unproven product -** This is of course a huge risk since it has barely launched, but for me is negated by the points above as well as the potential upside.  
 

**Conclusion:** This is far from a slam dunk and may but seems to be one of the most promising small cap altcoins I've come across in my research.. a unique value proposition with strong fundamentals and a good time to get in.

19,CryptoCurrency,PulseQ8,Sing this loud and clear,"Their spirits were sunken low

Their bags weighed more than a ton 

There was neither sign nor show 

When the bull began his run 

The shills were shilling wall-to-wall

The gig was up, they'd had their fun 

And every short got a margin call

When the bull began his run

The candles green came fast and tall

Each week was bold, and quick to stun 

His eyes burned red, and his horns did maul

When the bull began his run

Now fortune smiles upon the neet

His bags of gold gleam in the sun

Doubters dreamed of his balance sheet

And every bear was left with none

This blew up massively, so I wanted to share my new knowledge I got the past days:

I contacted a studied Master of Law who is familiar with crypto and Blockchain. However, this ist all referring to GERMAN law, so depending on your location this could be handled completely different.

I asked her the same question - „What if I guessed someone‘s key and took their coins?“

Apparently in German law it’s mandatory for a theft, that some physical moveable object was taken. As private keys are entirely virtual, this can’t count as theft and therefore is completely legal

Even worse, if someone just stole your hardware wallet, they would only need to pay for the wallet itself - NOT the keys and Bitcoin it stored. 

Why is this a thing? Because law is slow as fuck and has not nearly catched up with the internet - not to mention blockchain. 

However, depending on the original owners location, you could be seen as guilty in his country. Quite interesting situation

Hello everyone!

I'm kind of new to crypto and have a curiosity - all these new crypto that have exponential gains are real? Are there any people that turn millionaires in less than 24h because of these pumps? Or are there any other reasons behind these massive gains, like being deflationary or something, and in reality no human being is making real profits, it's just numbers going up and down?  


My gut feels are that none of this is real, I would like to know whether or not I am wrong, or if speculating these ""golden nuggets"" could make you a fortune overnight.

The app (government) would verify your identity (like KYC), and once verified, issue you a single token which you would spend to cast your vote.  Log in, pick your people, submit.  It gets written into the decentralized blockchain which is fully auditable.  Wouldn't this make elections much more secure and fast, plus remove the need for lines and voting in person?

An example would be where a trusted entity designs an election app that interfaces with a well established blockchain.  The potential voter would download it, submit the required information, and once verified would get rewarded with their election token.  You could get the ballot with your token so you can see who is on it so you can do your own research.  On election day, the submit button at the bottom would be available, you pick your people and that's it. 

You would have a simple public record, fully auditable by those that had the personal info records, and by the public who could see locations and numbers of submitted votes.

&gt;The Associated Press, a collective of more than 1,300 newspapers and broadcasters, is moving further into decentralized news and publishing. Today it announced a partnership with Chainlink Labs, and the AP is now launching its own Chainlink node to provide data to **blockchain** services.  
&gt;  
&gt;Starting November 2, AP says it will use Chainlink to automate actions that happen on-chain, including informing the over 15,000 outlets that use the AP’s platform of election results, sports outcomes, or when a company's quarterly financials are released. All of that will now be cryptographically signed to verify the data comes from the Associated Press.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Smart contracts need simple binary data in order to decide whether conditions are met in order to execute themselves."" Dwayne Desaulniers, AP’s director of blockchain and data licensing, told *Decrypt*. ""It's much easier to push out simple data than complicated sentences that would be more challenging for smart contracts to interpret and understand.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Since 2020, the AP has used blockchain to publish so-called tamper-proof news, such as the AP's projection that Joe Biden would be the next president of the United States.

IMO:

\- Technical: too difficult to acquire crypto (need to register for an exchange, KYC, etc) - difficult for an average Joe on the street

\- Technical: wallet transparency - if you pay your plumber in crypto one will see all your account's balance (not good nor secure)

\- Technical: easy to lose your funds and no way to get them back (e.g transfer to a wrong address)

\- Technical: scalability (although this is being worked on and there are solutions being implemented)

\- Political: lack of regulation and crazy volatility (feels like a casino) 

\- Political: governments can't control it, therefore, can't regulate it, therefore, might not accept it eventually

What can be done to help mass adoption?

\- make it easier to buy and spend crypto

Solr has a max supply of 100.000.000 Tokens.  
At the start of trading on kucoin, the price skyrocketed to 6539 $, many people - including me - los money. I like to know how something like this can happen. I am aware of the fact that people may sell off their ICO Coins at launch of a CEX Offering, but come on, i never saw something like this.  


ICO Public Token Price was 0,30 $, so 30 cents. private sale price was 7.5 cents and strategic sale price 15 cents. 30 cents would have brought the whole project with 100.000.000 tokens to 30 Million $ fully diluted marketcap. at 6540$, it would have been at 654.000.000.000 $ !  
Their Tokenomics stated that the initial supply was at 4 Million Tokens and 1.2 Million Marketcap.  
So 4 Million at a price of 6539 would have been [26.156.000.000](https://26.156.000.000) $. How is that possible?

6,CryptoCurrency,Chicky_Nuggy,Solana – a Bitcoin rival – will hit new all-time highs this year. Crypto Expert Chicky Nuggy divulges,"Bitcoin rival Solana will hit new all-time highs of $250 by the end of 2021, predicts the boss of one of the world’s largest independent Reddit accounts.

The bullish forecast fromChicky Nuggy, comes as the price of Solana (SOL) has jumped 25% in two days amid a buoyant week for other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin which hit a fresh record high on Wednesday of more than $66,000.

Currently, at the time of writing, Solana is $208.  Its previous price high was $214 reached in September this year.

Mr Nuggy says: “Solana is certainly a rising star of crypto. With its price skyrocketing more than 100 times since the beginning of the year, its potential is becoming impossible to ignore.

“I believe that its bull market run will continue for the rest of this quarter and that it will hit new all-time highs of $250 by the end of 2021.”

The Nugget boss and high-profile crypto advocate predicted in July that Bitcoin would surpass its previous all-time high this year – which was proven right this week. Similarly, he recently nailed his forecast that Cardano would hit $3.

He comments: “Solana has smashed past some key resistance levels in recent weeks, indicating that investors aren’t worried about squeezes to the downside.

“It’s gaining momentum and, as a result, a growing number of active holders. There’s no reason to expect this to slow considerably before the end of the year.”

Solana is a decentralised blockchain that gives developers a cutting-edge platform to create infinitely scalable DeFi apps and enable staking.

“The DeFi sector is about to explode due to the inherent real-world value it can offer almost every sector.

“Investors are increasingly understanding the network’s value not only as a platform for developers but as a worldwide financial utility.”

Mr C Nugg concludes: “Solana is set to quietly outperform the rest of the crypto market this year.  It’s one to watch.”",1634901423,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdepln/solana_a_bitcoin_rival_will_hit_new_alltime_highs/

And from there, you can almost feel a million within reach.

I mean, a million now seems what a 100,000$ felt like four years ago - almost impossible, like the world would implode if it happens or something, but look at it now, we're almost there and I'm quite certain it will be easily breached in the following weeks.

And I wouldn't even call this thinking hopium, in fact everything just points at this direction and it's bloody amazing. And I want to recall this post some time in the autumn of 2025, just counting days until it happens.

Historically, BTC has taken over for the initial part of the blowoff top of the bull run, it's gone parabolic and sucked the life out of everything else until it hits its peak. 

The BTC hype train is just leaving the station, the ETF is live, it's starting to hit the news, on top of that it's earnings call season. How many companies will declare BTC on its balance sheet over the next couple weeks? How many news articles will be published with other pension funds allocating capital to Bitcoin, what's the whole deal with the BTC ATMs in Walmarts?

Only banks and financial institutions would have access to the second layer solution. So if you were doing an international remittance, say, from The Philippines to Turkey and you and the recipient of the international remittance would receive lira and you would send Philippine Pesos.                

The problem? X-Rapid hinged heavily on regulatory clarity from every country with regards to crypto to make it happen.              

In conclusions, if things still work the way I recall them working:              
You would go to a bank in certain countries to send XRP (without knowing it) to a foreign corresponding bank.              
You could only do this with a bank. Alternatively you could just send friends or family XRP and they could cash it out on exchange, but there might be tax implications depending on the country.                      

With Strike you would use it to send USD that get converted to BTC through the lightning network, to any other Strike user.

19,CryptoCurrency,newbonsite,"Set out your plans and goals and stick at them, good luck new comers and OG's...","One of the main things to consider before investing into crypto is to have a plan.. This helps you put into perspective not only your investment goals, but when and how you want to achieve them..  It can also help to remove the likelihood of emotions influencing your investment decisions... 

There's no denying that the nature of investing can be emotional... There are times where you may feel tempted to change your investment strategy because an area of your portfolio is not doing well, or you received recent news the market is going to plummet... 

While these events may cause you to react quickly, such as selling off your assets, it's important to take a moment to consider your investment strategy...  If your approach is intended to be a long-term plan, making decisions based on short-term market fluctuations, may greatly affect what you set out to achieve... 

Review your timeframe and risk tolerance
It's important to consider how much time you're giving yourself to build towards your financial goal and how much risk you’re prepared to take on to get there... 

For example, an investment plan for retirement may look very different to someone who is much older or younger... If you're looking to access your money in a shorter time frame, remaining invested through ups and downs in the market may be unlikely, so a less risky investment approach may work to your favour...

One of the main advantages of investing in different cryptocurrencies , is the ability to diversify your risk... This means, if one of your investments doesn't perform well, your losses may not be as significant as if you only invest in the one crypto, as your other investments may help to level it out. On the flip side, it does take more effort as you'll need to remain up to date across a variety of coins/tokens...

Anyway, best of luck everyone and i wish you all an early retirement through crypto...",1634895610,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qddc5e/set_out_your_plans_and_goals_and_stick_at_them/

33,CryptoCurrency,ohyouwillseemeoften,"Bitcoin's 90% flash crash on Binance US, explained","Bitcoin prices plunged nearly 90 percent on the United States trading platform Binance in a flash Thursday morning. Prices dropped to as low as $8,200 from around $65,000. The cryptocurrency exchange attributed the flash price crash to a “bug” in the trading algorithm of an institutional customer

*What happened on Binance?*

At around 7:34 am New York time, the price of Bitcoin crashed from $65,760 to as low as $8,200. Within fleeting seconds, it bounced back up to almost exactly the price earlier. Volume stood at 592.8 Bitcoin on the exchange during the crash, which is just short of $40 million at current prevailing prices.
The plunge occurred only on Binance but knocked the Bitcoin price on other exchanges as well. On Bitstamp, the price dropped 2.3 percent around the same time but did not go below $63,600. On Coinbase, Bitcoin lost around $1,000.
The crash on Binance also had an impact on the Ethereum price rally, which lost around $2,000 from its price of just over $4,000 per ether.

*Reason for the crash*
 
Binance blamed the Bitcoin flash crash on an institutional trader's rogue algorithm. “One of our institutional traders indicated to us that they had a bug in their trading algorithm, which appears to have caused the sell-off,” Binance told Bloomberg. The company said the issue was resolved after the trader fixed the bug.
However, the flash crash came soon after Binance's chief executive warned crypto traders of high volatility in the coming months. ""Expect very high volatility in crypto over the next few months,"" Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted a day before the crash.
Mistaken crashes like this happen in finance when traders mess up details of their intended trades. Or when they enter the wrong order size or price. If the size of the trade is colossal, it can overwhelm an entire exchange leading to a quick, massive decline. This is called a flash crash.

42,CryptoCurrency,AEX2013,Blockchain Finance Module---Spot Trading,"Recently, spot trading is a blockchain finance scenario with the lowest threshold and the largest number of users. Whether purchasing certain cryptocurrencies or selling off them, you need to implement in the spot trading, which is the most common and the most basic trading matchmaking scenario in exchange.

Spot trading, by definition, is the process of trading actual cryptocurrencies, using one of the cryptocurrencies(such as USDT) as the conversion medium to purchase other cryptocurrencies. Spot trading usually facilitates the trade in accordance with  price first and time first.

**Why Need Spot Trading?**

Put simply, the reason is that users can not directly purchase cryptocurrencies using legal tenders. Blockchain finance is still in the early stage, and exchanges don't tap into traditional finance institutions(such as banks). If you want to trade cryptocurrency, it will not have a direct channel to settle. Users are unable to exchange into actual revenue in time when making a profit(Maybe have depreciated before selling); Users are unable to avoid asset loss when expected to fall down.

The loss of charge unit prevents cryptocurrency liquidity but brings out stablecoins (such as USDT, DAI). The stablecoin is one end (basis end) of the spot trading, while another end is various digital assets. The cryptocurrency with high consensus(such as BTC, ETH), of course, can also be the basis end in spot trading.

Novices without digital assets will exchange legal tenders into stablecoins （or BTC）to buy cryptocurrencies in the legal tender trading zone. Conversely, you could also exchange your cryptos into fiat money in this zone.

**AEX Spot Trading**

By July 16, 2021, AEX has opened 4 trading sequences of USDT, USDC, CNC, and BTC, releasing 296 cryptocurrencies and launching 314 trading pairs. And it divides into five zones in accordance with cryptocurrency liquidity, price stability,  study foreground, etc.

l Mainstream currency. All mainstream exchanges issue these cryptocurrencies with good liquidity, such as BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.

l platform currency. Issued by mainstream exchanges, such as BNB(Binance), HT(Huobi), GAT(AEX), etc.

l Innovative new currency. Such as NSS, TYT, etc.

l Potential currency. the early project with a great prospect, but the price may fluctuate violently. Such as TLM, ICP, ect.

l Low liquidity currency. Based on the liquidity to put them into other boards if needed.

**How Does AEX Help Users Achieve ""Safe Investment, Stable Value-added""**

In the field of digital assets with low popularity, if users(especially novices) want to achieve maximum return with a minimum degrees of risk, exchanges need to matter a lot.

Currency grading clarifies risk. On the one hand, AEX grade currency to minimize the risk of investment for users. On the other hand, the currency operator also makes considerate operation in order to add the currency value.

Identification clarifies investment direction. AEX identifies the currency base on the development status, dividing cryptocurrency accurately, such as NFT, Greyscale, DeFi, BSC, etc. Users are able to position the investment module and choose eligible currency.

Insist prospect currency strategy, respectable revenue for users. AEX  never happens serious system and asset accidents, which represent that we not only possess a complete technology, but also benefit from our quality control for cryptocurrencies. As the projects with a mass of users make a quick exit or the value of cryptocurrency goes to zero, which would cause a wide and fatal consequence, that is why AEX has only less than 300 issued currency. AEX first introduced DOGE, Ripple, BTC, NEM, Stellar, etc, with some rising over million times.

With the development of blockchain technology and the maturity of cryptocurrency industry, more and more people will start their spot trading travel. AEX also hope that users implement safe investment and stable value-added in spot trading.

As you have already realised, the golden age for your banks is drawing to an end. Crypto is the future and you already know this. So instead of fighting the future and becoming a luddite, it's time you embrace it.

Crypto is rapidly gaining adoption around the world and offering millions a chance out of poverty and more secure ways of storing their money, whilst reaping real gains that historically were only reserved for the already wealthy, your banks and your bonuses.

I would like to propose that you join the revolution rather than fighting it. Offer those that hold fiat accounts an option to receive their interest in crypto, so they have an opportunity to gain more than the current 0.05% on their savings and to allow those worried about crypto to better understand and trust it. Start offering crypto wallets, offer your customers an option to invest into crypto. Adopt and embrace the evolving technologies and solutions we also bring to the table. Overall, embrace change and you might just be around in 20 years.

3,CryptoCurrency,Ghostfxce,"$1,200 Stimulus Check Would Now Be Worth $1,292 If Used To Buy Euro","Excuse my title. It's just a play on the weekly posts here showing how much the april 2020 stimulus check would be worth today if it had been invested in Bitcoin (around $11k).

However, what I want to discuss here is closely related. as u/salil19 pointed out in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kdpc24/35_of_all_us_dollars_in_existence_have_been/), 35% of all USD in existence has been created in 2020. A more recent update: [this article](https://techstartups.com/2021/05/22/40-us-dollars-existence-printed-last-12-months-america-repeating-mistake-1921-weimar-germany/) shows that in May of 2021 this number climbed to 40% in the last 12 months. 

The Fed creating money out of thin air has been a popularly discussed topic on here. While many people don't exactly understand why inflation is necessary for an economy, the main concern is that it leads to a devaluation of the USD. This is a valid concern: if inflation is higher in the US than in other countries, the US Dollar will generally lose value against the currencies of those countries if other economic factors are equal.

For instance, since the European Central Bank has been creating money at a slower rate than the Fed during 2020-2021, the USD-EUR exchange rate should have been impacted in favour of the EUR. As most of us on here are more familiar with crypto charts than exchange rates, let's see if we can see this change reflected in the USDC-EUR chart.

[USDC-EUR rate](https://preview.redd.it/rkic7lxqkyu71.png?width=1165&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cc627d5dc0041caa7378ae2dcb8b0a47fd5ef0a)

Yep. As this chart illustrates, 1 USDC was worth around 0.91 EUR at the start of the Covid-19 crisis. This exchange rate started dropping rapidly as the Fed started 'printing' more money than the ECB in 2020 to a low around 0.81 EUR, currently hovering around 0.85 EUR.

Why is this relevant to cryptocurrency traders/investors? Well, since over 90% of crypto is traded against USD, USDT, USDC, and other stablecoins pegged to USD, many of us tend to have stacks of USD-equivalent currencies in our portfolio's. Maybe you're waiting for the next dip, maybe you're waiting a few months to see which way the markets go. What many don't realize is that even those stacks of ""stable coins"" can lose 10-15% of its value in a few months because of macro-economic powers we have no control over.

Whenever you are holding *stable coins* in your portfolio for an extended period of time, it might be worth considering whether USD or USD-pegged-stablecoins are your best choice. Many exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance offer the possibility of holding fiat currencies other than USD, and as we illustrated above, this might have a considerable impact on your portfolio.

Feel free to discuss or debunk some of the things I said, I am in no way an expert. Interested in your opinions.

**tl;dr - We tend to see stablecoins as a safe haven during times of uncertainty. However, macroeconomic powers can impact your portfolio because of varying inflation rates throughout the world. Sometimes, it is better to hold your assets in another currency than USD.**",1634891592,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdchn9/1200_stimulus_check_would_now_be_worth_1292_if/

IBM Worldwide uses Stellar technology to process cross-border payments. 

Here’s what it means:

&gt; We designed the original IBM World Wire to reduce the cost and friction in cross-border payment. We are happy to share it with the open source community. Here’s a look:

&gt; Utilizes the Stellar network which uses Lumens as bridge currency — essentially a unit of value for transfer of value and transaction costs calculations

&gt; All money transactions in the Stellar network (except lumens since it is a native asset) occur in the form of credit issued by anchors, so anchors act as a bridge between existing currencies and the Stellar network

&gt; Anchors are entities the network participants trust to hold their deposits and issue credits into the Stellar network for those deposits

&gt; The credit issuance implies digital obligates which need to be settled out of band via traditional rails, for example. The idea is to provide a choice in the network for anchors to issue credits or stablecoin for instant settlement — addressing various business cases and cost points to the ecosystem and network

14,CryptoCurrency,bawdyanarchist,"Flash Crash Investigation. Warning, Long Read! Skip if You Don't Like Numbers or Questions!","Okay I've been look at this flash crash a bit more, and I have more questions than answers now.

Exchanges that crashed:  Kraken (-18%), Gemini (-6.5%), BinanceUS (-87.5%), FTX (-11%)

These appear to be the #2, 3, and #4 exchanges in terms of USD volume in the US; with FTX being the only non-US exchange to flash crash. The #1 volume BTCUSD exchange in the US is Coinbase. For comparison, here are the volumes being reported on TradingView for the month of October: 

- Coinbase: 320k BTC   
- Kraken: 71k BTC    
- Gemini: 37k BTC   
- BinanceUS: 30k BTC    
- FTX: $14.8B, or maybe about 232k BTC at todays price    
- I'm assuming that those numbers for FTX must be in USD, but the reported numbers for the others must be in BTC, or else this wouldn't make much sense.    

At 11:34:15, both BinanceUS and Gemini experienced their first down wicks simultaneously, with FTX and Kraken following 5 seconds later. No BTCUSDT pairs that I have come across had any similar crash. No other exchanges I came across had anything other than a maybe 2-3% crash during the same timeframe. Here are the reported volumes on the exchanges (from TradingView):

- Exchange: [BTC volume of 1-min candle at flashcrash] : [sum of BTC volume between 11:34 and 11:39]
- BinanceUS: 579 : 626   
- Gemini: 325 : 397    
- Kraken: 803 : 1179   
- FTX: 192 : 449   
- Coinbase: 81 : 405  

So the first thing that stands out, is that FTX is *supposed* to be a large exchange with liquidity. So how did a sale of a mere 192 BTC for USD, flash crash the price by 11% ?? Someone said that BinanceUS is a shit exchange with thin orderbooks. Okay, but even if we concede that, the total Bitcoin sold in that 20-30 second period was only reported at about 1980 BTC across all those exchanges.

- How in the hell does a market sell of a mere 2k BTC cause a 7-18% flash crash across multiple exchanges??    
- Who in their right mind would market sell in such a fashion on such thin orderbooks to cause that much slippage against themselves? Was this a case of ""when bots attack""?    
- Why didn't Coinbase get hit with similar volume numbers in those same seconds, and why were they largely unaffected? 
- Why does this appear to have affected so heavily the major US based exchanges, but only 1 offshore exchange?  
- Does FTX being affected have anything to do with Sam Bankman-Fried and the fact that he is a US person running that exchange? Time for a  side trail ...  
  - Where the fuck did that guy come from anyways in 2019 to now be the richest person in crypto?   
  - He owns not only FTX (the broker / exchange), but also Alameda Research, a trading entity and liquidity provider that operates on the very same exchange that he runs.   
  - It's a massive conflict of interest to be both broker *and* liquidity provider / counterparty.     
  - How did he get such a sweatheart deal to receive 1/3 of all the Tether printed since 2020, via Alameda ""Research""?    
  - **Does the 11% flashcrash on his high leverage platform have anything to do with the fact that he is the liquidity provider and counterparty to trades on his own exchange??**   
  - Did FTX and Alameda have any significant profit from this flash crash?   

We have been seeing increasingly scummy behavior from places like Binance as well. We saw last week that Binance liquidated Eth positions when the price was nowhere near the liquiadation point, with customers saying Binance refused to compensate them anywhere near properly. During the May crash they liquidated customers who held inverse products that should *increase* in value when the underlying goes down. 

The next questions to ask are, WHY NOW? Aren't we supposed to be heading to new ATH on the ahmazing strength of all the institutional fomo and buy orders happening??   
- This doesn't have anything to do with Chinese toxic debt and its relationship to Tether does it?    
- This can't possibly have any relation to the fact that 141,000 BTC are about to be unlocked and available for selling on the open market from Gox could it?   
- Is there a relationship between [the huge 50% pump in 3 weeks that occurred almost out of nowhere on low USD volume] ... to ... this low volume flash crash? 

**A buggy algo on BinanceUS doesn't explain this.** Even a misbehaving set of bots doesn't explain this (given the very low volumes that caused it). It raises legitimate questions and suspicions about the state of liquidity in crypto. It *yet again* tends to invalidate the narratives about institutional buying and fomo supposedly happening right now. 

But it does make alot of sense in the context of fraud. This appears to be yet another instance in a litany, a saga of fraud and criminality rampant in crypto. And it should make everyone consider what kind of large systemic risks and dangers might be lurking nearby right now.

**YOU NEED TO PROTECT YOURSELF *NOW*.**  You need to risk diversify if you haven't already done so. Make sure that you're not lopsidedly exposed to any one particular type of risk. For example  ...       
- Whatever funds you leave on an exchange, need to be funds that you're okay with losing.   
- If you're trading leverage, you're now at a high risk of being falsely liquidated (whether to the up or downside).    
- If you're holding USDT or USDC, you could also be facing systemic risks that range from toxic chinese commercial paper causing a de-pegging; OR, a ""reluctant"" [rolls eyes] acquiescence to regulators; OR, or even criminal indictment, and the consequences that might have.   
- And even if you're all-in on permissionless cryptos right now (Monero, BTC, Eth, etc), you're facing escalating probabilities of a major liquidity unwinding in crypto that sees you lose a large amount of value in a short amount of time, and entrance into the next bear market (if we're not already there).    

So take anything you're not comfortable with losing, off the exchange. Unwind leverage trades, or at least start using less leverage on those trades. ***Take some damn profit!*** Seriously. Buy some gold/silver. And yes, even put some of that into (gasp) dirty fiat, so that you can live comfortably for a couple years if need be. Balance your stablecoin holdings with the kinds of risks you can tolerate. USDC for example is probably less likely to lose its peg, but more likely to force KYC you. USDT is probably less likely to KYC you without warning, but more likely to lose its peg.

Do any of those things *have* to happen? No. If none of those things happen, will I be here apologizing? **NO**. Again, when talking about trading and the future, we're dealing in probabilities, and we have to go by the evidence we have in front of us.

Yes we could continue up higher. I think that's less likely now, but it's still possible. Who knows, we might even see massive scam wicks to the upside as well. But every single goddamn piece of information and evidence that we're getting lately indicates escalating probabilities of what was previously very low-likelyhood but heavily damaging events. Those probabilities are not so low anymore.

17,CryptoCurrency,Badders00,Decentralised Art &amp; Why NFTs are misunderstood..,"Yes NFTs at the moment seem to be a mishmash of apes, punks and all manner of “throwaway” images. This leaves many people scratching their heads and asking.. “is this art”? Art is often conflated with the idea of beauty, but this is an intangible concept at best. It must be recognised that the achievement of “beauty” or “worth” in art is historically specific to conventions and fashions of the time in which the art is made. In simple terms.. achieving “beauty” is not always the artist’s goal. Art can encapsulate the extension of ideas or enlightenment of the viewer on a topic or question about society, politics, or the meaning of art itself.. e.g NFTs themselves spark debates about abstraction, systems of representation, or the very idea of what determines the economic or qualitative value of art. 

Crypto art is the ultimate “pop art”.. melding currency with art creation, and there is a lot that could be written about the relationship between pop art and crypto art. At it’s most basic much of crypto art work features bright colours and a central, large, bold image, the form itself is far from groundbreaking.. but the context within which it sits is where the magic truly lies. Decentralised art develops an entirely new audience of art enthusiasts, a new form of digital native art collectors, who are familiar with the concept of owning and valuing digital assets. Digital natives appreciate NFTs for their  relevance and accessibility in comparison to traditional art outlets.
Consequently, decentralised art expands the limited opportunities to showcase and to sell digital art at events, conferences and through the crypto art platforms.
This is both attractive and important, (particularly for emerging artists) as they face the traditional art world’s bias towards newcomers. Emerging artists have to build up their reputation with smaller exhibitions and events in a lengthy often multi-year process until they start being accepted into larger and more popular events. This tedious process impedes the funding and compensation opportunities for artists at their crucial early career stage. The lengthy practice forces many artists to either supplement their art career with other jobs or to give up. 

NFTs (through decentralisation) remove the middle men entirely, traditional rules and gatekeepers go out the window. Anyone, anywhere can great art and teach a global audience without the need for anyone else. Not to mention for emerging and established artists alike, these platforms simplify the whole sales process tremendously and entirely eliminate many risks and concerns of art sales. In this decentralised art world, the artist:
• Is paid instantly without delays;
• Benefits from low or no commissions
• Potentially earns a percentage on all secondary sales (on some platforms)
• Will have full price control
• Can sell artwork internationally without shipping/customs restrictions
• Has the option to remain anonymous
• Is able to capitalize on already existing physical artwork by digitizing it
to an altered, enhanced or even unedited state

In short the impact decentralised art has in regard to artists is both remarkable and underrated. It has the potential to enable any artist around the world to to crate without hinderance, to drive digital and traditional artists alike to enter the crypto art landscape and to fuel new digital creations. NFTs and decentralised art have the potential to establish a new art movement, not just a temporary trend.. the best is yet to come!",1634890558,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdc9sh/decentralised_art_why_nfts_are_misunderstood/
23,CryptoCurrency,TryingToMakeAMil,All the posts you’ve seen about when to sell are NONSENSE. THIS is the way to take profit.,"Obviously the easiest way to do it is just to not be a greedy ape and simply sell when you have made money, but it’s also the least efficient way.

Here is how you can optimise your profit taking for maximum gains.

**1. Learn basic TA**

If you’re going to trade you have to learn some basic technical analysis (TA). The most basic way to do it is to get an app like TradingView and draw horizontal lines on resistance and support - this is how you will tell if your asset is being pushed in a certain direction.

Lower time frames (LTF) like 4H and 1D are useful for short term analysis. Higher time frames (HFT) like 1D and 1W are useful for long term analysis. A good example just occurred recently where Bitcoin had the highest weekly close ever with 3 green candles in a row - this is called “Three White Soldiers” pattern and was a good indication for a new ATH.

Rule of thumb: sell resistance, buy support

**2. DCA**

Just how you DCA when you’re buying, you can DCA when you’re selling. Keep taking profits on the way up if you’re unsure when the top will be in. You can sell 10-25% of your stack at each major resistance.

If the resistance breaks, great - the rest of your stack is going higher. If it fails to break resistance, it’s going down likely to test support.

**3. Use stop loss**

You can set limit orders on your sells so that if the price drops to a certain level it will automatically sell your stack. It’s a good way to not get burned with big drops, but be careful - sudden price drops can shake you out by triggering stop losses (liquidations).",1634890340,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdc8bk/all_the_posts_youve_seen_about_when_to_sell_are/

41,CryptoCurrency,BruteSilverback,Imperium blockchain based on the Mimble Wimble protocol testnet launch beginning of november from INSIDER PROTOCOL project,"The Mechanics of the Future team from the Insider Protocol project has been working on creating an anonymous and non-traceable cryptocurrency IPRO based on the MimbleWimble protocol, which should soon surpass the well-known Monero (XMR) and Dash. MimbleWimble is a protocol with wide scalability and increased privacy. It uses the technology of confidential transactions, encrypting all inputs and outputs, as well as their public and private keys. MimbleWimble also uses CoinJoin. The technology allows you to take payments from multiple senders and combine them into a single transaction, which makes it impossible to determine for a third party which recipient of the payment was intended.

''After years of hard-working finally, we are ready to launch the TESTNET of our MW-based blockchain within several months for public testing. Untraceable transactions and hidden wallet data are coming soon!''

In the first iteration, over 30 cryptocurrencies will already be available, including the IPRO itself and its derivatives in the form of DeFi.

By default, all transactions will be private with the ability to send comments to the transfer while hiding the sender's address.

**TESTNET**

IMPERIUM launch, Fastest transaction speed (faster than Solana protocol). There is almost no commission, they are so small that you won't notice them. The ability to get and send private cryptocurrencies. Protection from spam attacks on the blockchain while maintaining minimal transaction fees.

One of the unique features will be that users will be able to not only create their own DeFi apps but also deploy them on their own. From our side, there will be smooth and seamless integration with our ecosystem, IPRO based finance, wallets, etc. Users will be able to create their own financial products in the form of lending, stable coins, pools and provide access to them to other users.

Atomic swaps with a bond against ETH, USDT, USDC, WBTC, and DAI. The ability to create a global account for users (optional). At the moment, several startups of the gaming industry, based on cryptocurrency, are already taking part in testing and development.

**Stable coin**

We are planning to launch our own stable coin with the support of our insurance fund and hedge fund partners.

**Binance partnership**

Besides going to Binance. Launchpad we are also going to integrate part of our ecosystem with the Binance Smart Chain

**VPN**

Wormhole VPN protocol (working title) will also be implemented for modules of the entire ecosystem. In case of blocking and the impossibility of working of the project nodes due to the negative and stupid policy of any country in relation to cryptocurrencies and the inclusion of locks at the state levels, in response, an automatic bypass of such locks through the darknet nodes will be included.

**Blockchain Documentation and Validator nodes**

On the launch day of the MW-based blockchain, the full documentation of the project will be available for third-party devs. The information will be especially interesting for those who decide to use our ecosystem to launch their own apps.

We are also working on the validator nodes and the definition of holders' rewards of our main asset IPRO. The information will be available on the 2nd Stage.

**Blockchain and wallet features on mainnet**

\- Atomic Swaps

\- DAPP

\- DAO Governance

\- connection of BTC, ETH, LTC, DASH, XMR, QTUM, and many other networks for swaps

\- multi language interface

\- desktop and mobile wallets (macOS, Windows, Linux)

\- browser extension version like MetaMask

\- more details will be revealed after the testnet launch",1634889440,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdc1h8/imperium_blockchain_based_on_the_mimble_wimble/

Yes, some coins or tokens might get some raise, but generally market goes up ish, then it just stays there with slight hint of promise about bigger boost, and then everything goes red, but not bloody red, just red.

I wonder how long it takes this time AND what China will come up with so they can kill bull once again when it starts running again..?

So, it’s no surprise my colleague and contributor to this article, Nitin Gaur and his team, tackled the unthinkable four years ago by building a global payment network addressing remittance and interbank payments.

As if that wasn’t challenge enough, the team also designed it for the various regulatory and compliance requirements with robust payment operations, aiming to break all conventional mindsets to become more open and transparent.

The pandemic has forced many businesses and industries to reevaluate their strategies, customers, and teams. Our cross-border payment network, also known as IBM World Wire, was no different. We took a closer look at the landscape and strategic priorities of operationalizing a payment network and licensing. So, in late 2020, we shifted our focus from running a network to taking the learnings and applying it to our clients as service accelerators for our financial institution clients and payment providers.

With that, we are excited to announce that recently (after dealing with a lot of red tape), we have open-sourced the code behind IBM World Wire! We are committed to the open source community and accelerating our clients with what we have learned. You can find the [code here](https://github.com/GFTN/gftn-services).

Untapped potential for a cross-border payments network

This is a cutting-edge network for cross-border payments, utilizing the Stellar-powered [blockchain](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/what-is-blockchain) network. The core value of this network is to address the cost and friction in cross border payments.

As an alternative payment rail, it aims to reduce cost, remove friction, assert efficiency in settlement. Starting with money transfer operators (MTOs), this network aims to expand to other payment streams including B2B, banks and corporate payments.

We designed the original IBM World Wire to reduce the cost and friction in cross-border payment. We are happy to share it with the open source community. Here’s a look:

* **Utilizes the Stellar network which uses Lumens as bridge currency — essentially a unit of value for transfer of value and transaction costs calculations**
* **All money transactions in the Stellar network (except lumens) occur in the form of credit issued by anchors, so anchors act as a bridge between existing currencies and the Stellar network**
* **Anchors are entities the network participants trust to hold their deposits and issue credits into the Stellar network for those deposits**
* **The credit issuance implies digital obligates which need to be settled out of band via traditional rails, for example. The idea is to provide a choice in the network for anchors to issue credits or** ***stablecoin*** **for instant settlement — addressing various business cases and cost points to the ecosystem and network operator.**

## A closer look at the cross-border payments network

This network is an application programming interface (API) payments product that is aimed to support the money transmission services of financial institutions. These software services use the [blockchain](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain) network and the APIs. IBM serves as the network operator and hosts validator nodes. Transactions between participants are processed according to the consensus algorithm defined by the blockchain network.

As the network operator, IBM created network accounts in participants’ names and under participants’ control, including for the exchange of funds and value transfers. These accounts are designated solely for use in conjunction with IBM’s software services. Participants communicate with each other and exchange information, by way of the blockchain network, through their use of the network to transfer value between themselves.

Participants can settle transactions either directly between themselves off-network via a digital obligation, or on-network through the transfer of virtual currencies or other [digital assets](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/digital-assets) between their accounts by means of ledger entries maintained within the blockchain network.

92,CryptoCurrency,Skapax,Tranchess explodes? - Why? / Whales? - Beginning of Alt Season?,"Hey fellas,

I just saw that the value of tranchess just spiked really high and therefore I wonder is there a reason behind it or are whales just playing the rich mans game again?

**URL:** https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tranchess/

Here some facts on tranchess: 

Tranchess is a yield enhancing asset tracker with varied risk-return solutions. Tranchess provides a different risk/return matrix out of a single main fund that tracks a specific underlying asset. The name Tranchess was inspired by the game of chess, as well as the French word “Tranche”, which is often associated with tranche funds that caters to different class of investors with varying risk appetite. Tranchess was launched on 24th June 2021.

The main fund, aka token Queen, tracks a specific underlying asset and can be split equally into 2 sub funds. We have purposefully chosen BTC as the first crypto asset to track. Meanwhile, it also shares many of the popular DeFi features such as: single-asset yield farming, borrowing &amp; lending, trading, etc.

**Tranchess provides:**

* Enhanced yield returns without incurring impermanent losses
* Leveraged positions at low cost and no forced liquidation
* Zero Lock-in Period for Queen holders
* Prevention of Oracle Attacks using TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price)

Who Are the Founders of Tranchess Protocol?

Tranchess Protocol is the brainchild of Co-Founder Danny Chong and Team. The concept was incepted in 2020 with a team across diverse experiences and roles in tech firms such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft to Investment Banks such as Morgan Stanley, UBS and BNP Paribas.

Our tech team is particularly experienced with cyber security in trading and DeFi protocols, their knowledge in smart contract coding is additive to the maintenance and upgrades in years to come.

Danny himself had worked at both BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, holding positions across his career from trading, sales and management regionally in FICC space.

It is the team’s vision to empower users of DeFi with Omni Asset Management capabilities and contributing to the paradigm shift from Traditional Finance to DeFi. And in time, to offer a full product suite in Asset Management Protocols, tailored for DeFi users across risk capacities and appetites.

**What makes Tranchess Unique?**

The project leverages on smart contracts that makes it transparent and automated across processes. The protocol allows users to have enhanced earning while tracking BTC, earns extra interests by lending out their tokens, or enjoying leverage with no forced liquidation. Users also get a share of platform earnings as part of their staking returns. Tranchess ecosystem allows gain from both NAV and yield perspectives.

**How is Tranchess Protocol Secured?**

Our smart contracts do not rely on price feeds from other smart contracts and thus are highly resistant to price manipulation such as flash loan attacks. Tranchess price oracle uses 30-minute TWAP instead of discrete oracle price. This minimizes the possibility of oracle manipulation attack. Tranchess oracle extends the Open Oracle standard by Compound, accepts signed price data from two separate sources (Coinbase and OKEX) and computes time-weighted average price (TWAP) in every 30-minute epoch.

Other security measures includes: Multiple rounds of code audit by reputable teams (Peckshield &amp; Certik), Bug Bounty (Immunefi) and Multi-signature settings.

**How many CHESS Tokens are in circulation?**

Chess Tokens has a max supply of 300 million with following allocation: 5% seed investors, 20% core team, 15% reserved for future investors, 50% liquidity mining, 10% Treasury.

300,000 from Treasury are released through Pancakeswap’s liquidity pool.

CHESS emission as below:

For Week 1-4, 300,000 on the first week, and each new week thereafter adds 300,000 new tokens additionally on top of previous week’s distribution.

Week 5 distributes 2,400,000 tokens.

For Week 6-20, starts from 2,304,000 and decreases by 4% each week onwards.

Remaining distribution to be decided later.

**Elements of the** **AMM+ Arena**

**Trading competition prize pool**  
Users will be able to reference a leaderboard, which shows where you place amongst your peers and the performance ranking of the top 10 AMM users. The prize pool is divided into three tiers, with the highest tier distributing $10,000 USD in rewards. The prizes will be divided amongst the top 10 winners who have achieved the highest 7-day average APR of that week.

The process to enter the competition is extremely easy and only requires a CoinFLEX account. Users can [sign up](https://hubs.la/H0Zp8lJ0) in minutes with email or MetaMask. **All you need to do is create an AMM+ position with a minimum of $1,000 USD.**

**Weekly missions**

Weekly missions are personal objectives tied to your trading volume targets. **You are automatically enrolled into the weekly mission as soon as you set up an eligible AMM+ position**. There are three mission tiers; when you reach the corresponding trading volume thresholds, you can claim your rewards.

**Limited Edition NFTs**

The first 100 eligible AMM+ Arena participants are eligible to claim an Arena NFT. The weekly champion is entitled to claim exclusive NFTs that represent their selected Arena character legend.  Each Arena legend will only have five unique editions.

Eligible users will need to provide their email and Ethereum addresses to claim their NFTs. CoinFLEX will then transfer the NFT to the verified Ethereum address, which the holder can view on [OpenSea](https://hubs.la/H0Zp6SJ0).

44,CryptoCurrency,dorf12,Is it a good idea to convert small assets to BNB?,"On my binance app, there are a few coins which I never bought so im not sure how they ever got there but they are worth basically nothing at the moment. 

They include BTT, USDT, BUSD, JST, WIN @ NFT. 

For each of them, i own less than 30c worth. I have no intention of ever buying more of those coins or using them for anything at all. 

Is it a good idea to convert to bnb?

My only concern is if one of them turns for example, from being worth 0.00003 cents to being 0.01 then i miss out on a big rise as i have 60,000 coins. 

Sorry i am very new to crypto so this is probably a silly noob question.",1634884813,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdb25b/is_it_a_good_idea_to_convert_small_assets_to_bnb/
54,CryptoCurrency,David_154,What does the blockchain do? Keeping bills. So what is the exact statement?," 

1. Miner: To be precise, it is the person who records the bill. Record transaction records. Your payment can only be successful if they keep the bills for you. If they don't record the bills for you, you can't pay.

2. Mining machine: Mining machine is a machine that provides powerful computing power.

He is not an excavator, he is not a mining machine.

3.1 What is mining?

Take rewards. There are two reward mechanisms. The first is transaction fees.

The person who keeps the bills (miners) can’t work in vain. To help you keep track of the bills, you have to pay him and pay some handling fees.

3.2 The second type is block rewards

In the beginning, there is no transaction, and there is no handling fee, so how can the bookkeeper feed the mining machine (pay the electricity fee)?

Then you can only give some rewards and issue coins directly to the miners

How did this word come from?

Because there is a metaphor in the white paper.  
It is metaphorized by mining.  
Because everyone did not understand the professional knowledge mentioned in the white paper, only this metaphor understood, so ""mining"" became popular",1634884172,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdawzl/what_does_the_blockchain_do_keeping_bills_so_what/

General Usage: The data below provides you with everything you will need to use your addresses anywhere you deem fit. The addresses in your [Block.io](https://Block.io) account are multi-signature addresses of the type P2SH, P2WSH-over-P2SH, or P2WSH. Each address requires two private keys. The first key is BIP32-derived, and the second key is fixed. You can use any BIP32 tools to determine private/public keys for your addresses at depth i, where 0 &lt;= i &lt; total addresses created\_by you for the network. The information below may be incomplete for developers that have used Distributed Trust addresses, for which you specified your own public keys, and already have the redeem scripts needed.

&amp;#x200B;

We recommend using self-hosted Bitcoin Core, Litecoin Core, and Dogecoin Core wallet software for using these keys to transact with your addresses, but you can determine and use any other tools that might fit your needs.

64,CryptoCurrency,XxLetsgetrichxX,We are early.,"

This is the second time I've watched bitcoin buzz explode. The first time I thought the whole world was about to catch on and adopt. Before long I walked away from the space, not realizing that I was nothing but a tourist at the time. Full scale adoption never happened. Until yesterday morning I felt the same way with what has been happening the past week. That adoption was imminent.

I finally realized that bitcoin buzz is what it is because I put my eyes and ears in range of bitcoin information. In the online circles I frequent crypto is a done deal. Everyone understands and believes in the crypto future.

Offline, not a single person I've spoken to has a clue what is going on, besides being aware of bitcoins existence. 

The majority of these people are firmly middle class, looking at retirement within the next 20 years, and have investment vehicles they rarely if ever look at besides to check a paper statement for their bottom line.

We are early. Our neighbors will be scrapping for satoshis in 10 years while we look at a cold wallet with .003 BTC thankful we can pay for a nice vacation and buy presents for everyone while we are gone.

I expect volatility. People will take profits(or losses) and re enter lower(or higher), that is how markets work. Being down in a position does not mean you have lost money. You don't lose money until you sell. I won't sell because I believe the future is in crypto.

I'm here today to present to you what's almost literally GME 2.0 in crypto form. Disclaimer: Not financial advise. I'm not a financial adviser, just a dude that believes in crypto

**PART 1 - What's** [**AMPLEFORTH**](https://www.ampleforth.org/)**?**

[Ampleforth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N6NbegTJ8SubTVWcwRSKrmFNO5LqfnPB/view) is rebasing token. Put simply, when the price is above it's target - the supply increases. When it's below, supply decreases. So while the price looks like it's pretty stable, the market cap can actually go parabolic, because the changing supply numbers. In fact, that's what happened when they kicked off DeFi summer with a liquidity providing incentives program.

**PART 2 - Why has it been trash since?**

Well if we look at our marketcap chart, it wasn't doing too bad, until about May of this year. There's been a few reasons why it's been underperforming the rest of the crypto market to date:

1. They launched on Aave - (but ONLY as a borrowing pool, i.e. you can't use AMPL as collateral yet). What this means it it's been easier to profit by shorting Ampl. How?

* Borrow AMPL and sell for USDC
* Deposit USDC as collateral
* Borrow more Ampl and short again
* Run it back, rinse and repeat

1. Aave has had UI problems that's been displaying incorrect interest rates… until [today](https://twitter.com/evankuo/status/1451262330080137241). This is actually across all markets, not just AMPL. For AMPL, it's been showing interest rates of \~500% APY, when it reality it was in the 1000s%. In fact, at the time of writing this, the current APY on AMPL is 100,000%. That's not a typo. I may not know how to read, but I do write.

Shorties have been borrowing and shorting with the upper hand, but it's possible some of them haven't even known how much interest they've been accruing.

**PART 3 - Short Whales**

Our buddy over [here](https://twitter.com/PepeSoros/status/1451058251819204608) shorted 600k AMPL at $1.15, and now AMPL is finally above it's price target so it's drawing some attention (along with cross chain initiatives). As a result, people have also been withdrawing their AMPL from the liquidity pool so that they can keep the supply growth. This has effectively made it so that our shorty whale buddy can't borrow any more. And he's paying an interest rate of [112,000%](https://app.aave.com/#/reserve-overview/0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a161-0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a1610xb53c1a33016b2dc2ff3653530bff1848a515c8c5) at the time of writing to keep it going.

Oh. Have I got your attention now?

**FAQ-1: WUT DO?**

As long as AMPL is above it's price target, this shit will literally go parabolic… again. If you really want, you can also deposit you AMPL, collect some of that sweet interest while depositing the liquidity tokens into their vault at [geyser.ampleforth.org](https://geyser.ampleforth.org/) to collect EVEN MORE AMPL.

Meanwhile- our whale buddy keeps accruing interest owed - he'll eventually NEED to buy back [800k](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf013d90e4e4e3baf420dfea60735e75dbd42f1e1?a=0x814611f0eb8c0befb5b6892ca836e51784e9b9b4). If everyone holds to keep their supply increases, price only go up. Leading to more supply increases. Literally cannot go tits up unless EVERYONE sells.

**FAQ-2: But TheWhackBateman, what about the fundamentals?**

Fundamentals? Bruh, the fundamentals on AMPL have never been stronger.

1. Ampl is the original non-collateralized rebasing token, and it's the only one to have survived this long (since 2019). There's been at least 40 hard forks of AMPL, all have failed. (\*cough\* YAM \*cough\*)
2. The foundation has burned the [admin keys](https://cryptobriefing.com/ampleforth-removes-upgradeability-decentralizes-into-community/) earlier this year, making it fully decentralized along with a separate governance token.
3. AMPL has began entering it's application phase. Up until now, AMPL has just been an experiment on the market with smooth-brains alike. It's shown that it can stand the test of time, and now it's starting to be used in actual DeFi applications. More on that below.

**FAQ-3 How do I know this ain't a scam token?**

Bruh. The investors in the foundation include [VC's like Huobi and Pantera](https://www.ampleforth.org/about/). Oh and did I mention, [BRIAN ARMSTRONG](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/brian-armstrong). Yes, THE BRIAN ARMSTRONG that's CEO of Coinbase. And he invested in AMPL out of his personal pocket too. Oh. And did I mention that he went to Yale with Brandon Iles who co-founded AMPL with Evan Kuo? Our boi's were literally [coding](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/all-the-dizzying-ways-people-are) with each other back in the day. These names are too legit.

**FAQ-4 I don't like ERC-20's. Gas be high.**

AMPL is chain-agnostic. They've been working on getting onto all the hot chains. They're already on [BSC](https://bscscan.com/address/0xFd55eBc7bBde603A048648C6eAb8775c997C1001). They're technically already on [Matic](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xc67238827da94b15f6ba10f3d35f690809919f75)\- but are waiting on UI updates. And recently, they just got onto [AVAX](https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/address/0x027dbcA046ca156De9622cD1e2D907d375e53aa7/transactions). They haven't even announced AVAX yet because it sounds like there's some juicy stuff coming up. The team has also mentioned L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism in the discord server.

**FAQ-5 Wtf are the applications about?**

One of the applications on [testnet](https://test.borrow.prl.one/borrow) is called [Mooncake](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKMAuro2NZEgiD-hvI3Scy5fmHcaoOObC8qKu0GdcZU/edit#). The group working on it is called [PRL](https://www.prl.one/) which is being led by ja boi [Manny Rincon-Cruz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelr5/) from Stanford (also an AMPL advisor), who's basically been studying money &amp; finance his whole life. Basically it's a lending app that will make it so that you can:

* Deposit your AMPL as collateral to borrow up to 50% of it in USDx
* NO LIQUIDATIONS, and you technically don't even need to pay it back
* This mean you can get TFT (Tax Free Tendies)  

   * When you want to sell just deposit into Mooncake and get 50% as USDx
   * At the end of your loan you get 50% of your original AMPL back.
   * Deposit into mooncake again.
   * Run it back.

You aren't selling if it's a loan. 🧠🧠🧠

Basically the way this works is it takes your AMPL and slices it up so that when the supply expands or shrinks, half of it gets reserved for b00mers that want steady value, and the other half goes to degens like me who are trying to get leveraged to the tits. If you didn't know already, this is basically how [Wall Street](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-07/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-looking-for-tether-s-money) makes MBS's. Our modern economy runs off of shit like this. And this is just the beginning, you make a whole stew of different slices for different products. Just like WallStreet. Except it's the free market.

Oh. Also, they're doing a workshop with AMPL as a part of ChainLink Hackathon next week.

Did I also mention [wAMPL](https://ampltools.com/wamplwatch/)? Wtf is wAMPL you ask?

Well turns out, the crypto-space is soooo smooth that the supply fluctuations got us moon-bois shook when the balance in our wallet changes. So they made this wrapped version of AMPL, that represents a fixed portion of the supply so us degens don't need to worry about the balance changing - but still keeping the base underlying tokenomics to be the same.

JK JK - although that probably played a role in this token's creation - the bigger reasons are:

1. Makes AMPL easier to integrate with other projects since supply won't be changing. Imagine a DAI collateralized by AMPL.
2. Makes it easier to list AMPL on CEX's. One of the major reasons AMPL has struggled to get onto CEX's is because of the moon-boi failure mode I described. wAMPL will fix this. Not to mention, our boi Brian Armstrong [listed the AMPL governance token](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1384991075970998282?lang=en) (FORTH) at the drop of hat, making it one of the fastest tokens to ever get listed on CB. Oh. And CB institutional [tweeted about AMPL](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseInsto/status/1445431280724627459?s=20) a while back. Maybe so it can give their WallStreet buddies a heads up that there's another space they can do their slicing and dicing. I'll let you decide. Ok ok one more. Richy, who used to be part of the AMPL team (and is still an advisor) [recently changed roles to work for CB](https://twitter.com/richy_qiao/status/1443357901402173441)...

**TLDR:**

* Whales [shorted AMPL](https://twitter.com/PepeSoros/status/1451058251819204608) well below it's fair value, because you can't use it as collateral anywhere yet.
* Now they're trapped paying up to [181,752%](https://app.aave.com/#/reserve-overview/0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a161-0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a1610xb53c1a33016b2dc2ff3653530bff1848a515c8c5) until someone sells. Whales possibly haven't been aware of interest accruing until today, when [Aave fixed their UI](https://twitter.com/evankuo/status/1451262330080137241).
* If AMPL stays above it's price target, shit will literally go exponentially to the moon
* Even if it doesn't the long term fundamentals on AMPL are so strong, that it's arguably the best buy for MC &lt; 300M
* PRL is going to launch a [lending app](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKMAuro2NZEgiD-hvI3Scy5fmHcaoOObC8qKu0GdcZU/edit#) that will let you sell 50% of your AMPL tax-free, and/or get leveraged to the tits with the remaining 50%
* AMPL is going cross chain onto [Matic](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xc67238827da94b15f6ba10f3d35f690809919f75), already on [BSC](https://bscscan.com/address/0xDB021b1B247fe2F1fa57e0A87C748Cc1E321F07F), [AVAX](https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/address/0x027dbcA046ca156De9622cD1e2D907d375e53aa7/transactions) and talks of Arbitrum and Optimism too",1634882729,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdall1/ampleforth_gme_20_moass_incoming/
82,CryptoCurrency,cheforte,Is there enough bitcoin in the world?,"This might be unrealistic, but let’s say that bitcoin becomes the worlds most valuable asset and people are paid and spend in bitcoin all over the world.

89,CryptoCurrency,tx2005,"What are the tax implications for ""reflections"" type benefits for US based investors? Do possible issues with taxes keep you away from coins/tokens that offer reflections?","While I've been getting my feet wet in crypto, I've been very impressed with the number of ways to make money outside of just buying and holding. One I'm specifically wondering about are ""reflections"", where token owners are given a share of new tokens, usually from a ""tax"" on buying/selling transactions. Reflections should provide incentive for people to buy and hold vs frequently trading, not only to avoid the tax, but also because as their amount of tokens owed increases, so should their reflections. 

After initially being excited by the idea and being interested in finding some tokens so look at that offer reflections, I started to wonder about the tax implications (specifically for US based investors). From the research I've done so far, it looks like the IRS has specifically stated how reflections should be accounted for on taxes. In discussions I've found, many feel reflections shouldn't be taxed until you sell, but others state that reflections are taxed similar to dividend income with stocks (ie taxed at the time you earn the dividend, even if you immediately reinvest those dividends). 

From my understanding, taxes for airdropped tokens (often provided as a benefit from a token's team as a reward for holding) are assessed the same way as dividends. This isn't that difficult as I believe these transactions can be easily tracked, especially if you use one of the various crypto tax services that you can import many exchanges/wallets into. As long as you know the date, the amount of the airdrop in tokens, and the value at the time, then it can easily be accounted for on your taxes.

With reflections, this seems to be much more difficult. Taking Safemoon as an example (given it might be one of the most well known tokens that offers reflections), I believe reflections are added to your total token amount in real time. While I don't own Safemoon, I've seen token owners state their total token ownership is constantly increasing in real time as people are buying/selling Safemoon (which results in a 10% tax, part of that tax being the reflection that goes directly to token owners). The fact that this occurs in realtime all day and night makes it seem like a complete nightmare (and in reality....impossible) to track the amount of each and every new reflection (along with the value of the token at the time of the reflection), given you are likely talking about hundreds, or maybe thousands of mini transactions every day.

It may not be a big deal when token values are low and the amount of reflections are minuscule, but I imagine one day, some specific token (maybe Safemoon....or more likely another token offering a similar benefit) will skyrocket in value, and those minuscule reflections will become substantial. At that point, I am very concerned with how the IRS will expect investors to account for these gains, and while it might be impossible to do (have a log of each and every reflection with date/time/amount of tokens/token value), the IRS really doesn't care. They can and will use their power if they believe you are ""underpaying"". 

WIth all of that said, does anybody know if there has been anything done to try to mitigate this risk? Based on this, I'm honestly considering just staying away from any token with reflections done in real time unless there is some sort of easily tracked log that we can use to avoid any sort of tax trouble. 

I'm interested what others think about this issue. Have any crypto projects that offer reflections spoke up about how to mitigate any concerns with taxes? Does this make you hesitant to invest in projects that offer reflections or am I just being paranoid?",1634882303,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdahus/what_are_the_tax_implications_for_reflections/

19,CryptoCurrency,Fluid_Department_120,Too popular: Bitcoin futures ETF in danger of hitting upper limit for contracts,"The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF is on track to reach a limit on the number of futures contracts it’s allowed after quickly becoming a little too popular.

After just a couple of days of trading, the ProShares ETF has reached 1,900 contracts sold for October and there is 2,000 front-month limit imposed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

There are already 1,400 contracts for November and there is an overall maximum limit of 5,000 open contracts according to Bloomberg. One solution could be to offer longer contracts, but that would carry the danger of too much distancing from BTC prices.

President of the advisory firm the ETF Store, Nate Geraci, commented that the fund could start to diverge from market prices, adding:

“The ETF is forced to obtain Bitcoin price exposure at higher and higher prices as it goes further out on the futures curve.”
The launch of competing products such as the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF which will commence trading today, and the VanEck ETF which is expected to trade on Monday, Oct. 25, may dilute the demand for the ProShares fund.

As reported by Cointelegraph, the ProShares ETF became the first-ever fund to hit $1 billion in assets under management in just two days. It beat an 18-year-old record previously held by a gold-based fund that did it in three.

Bloomberg senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, said that the momentum will still be hard to stop at this point.

“The unprecedented early volume in BITO makes it like a snowball rolling downhill, as liquidity and assets begets more liquidity and assets.”
Related: VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF will likely launch next week as crypto prices reach ATHs

Balchunas also thinks that the success of Bitcoin futures products may speed up the approval of a spot-based Bitcoin ETF.

“Both the success, general functioning of ETFs and the clear issue of potential capacity of futures may get the SEC to reconsider or work out a path for spot.”",1634881844,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdaebp/too_popular_bitcoin_futures_etf_in_danger_of/
23,CryptoCurrency,Flasheninhalt,"""This coin is dead""-posts are pathetic and annoying.","Hi,

every time somebody drops a post about a coin being highly overrated i think about the purpose of OP. And there only can be some of that reasons:

* Either you want that people leave this coin and put their money in your favorite coin to make it rise.
* Or you cant get over that fact that you missed the train and now want to see the coin fall because you already sold or never entered.
* Or mostly common reason karma farming in this sub and you all know what this means.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let me ask you some questions:

1. Why do you care about a coin that u think is dead or overrated? My advice: Leave it and leave the people that are into it!
2. You know these people who say ""Don't listen to users in this sub""? They are talking about you, think about it.
3. What is your benefit of bringing people to sell a coin? Do you really think you improve the crypto game with that? 

Number 2 is my favorite think about it again.

Even if you have an analysis of this dead coin, great for you. But people better don't care. A lot of people tried to analyse alts before.

&gt;!Leave Cardano alone!!&lt;

By officially becoming a baker, DSRV will  now validate transactions (blocks) and add them into the Tezos  ecosystem.**

DSRV is a validator and  infrastructure provider with a deep understanding of blockchain,  providing infrastructure for early blockchain networks into the  sustainable Proof-of-Stake consensus, requiring 2 million times less  energy than the Proof-of-Work mechanism.

As a Korean blockchain entity, DSRV  has received a seed investment from Naver D2SF in 2020 and attracted  Series A investment from KB Investment and Samsung NEXT in May this  year.   


&gt;***“DSRV wants to become a partner that considers the overall  expansion of the blockchain industry ecosystem together with partners  and clients who share a vision. We will contribute to making the Tezos  ecosystem healthy and constant,” said Ji Yoon Kim, CEO of DSRV.***   
 

The Tezos blockchain operates on the  consensus algorithm based on a Liquid Proof-of-Stake mechanism (LPoS).  Block creators, called “bakers” on Tezos, are responsible for validating  transactions, securing the network, and voting on key network  upgrades.

Asia as a whole  is a fertile ground for blockchain innovation, and one of the key  driving factors for TZ APAC is to uplift early blockchain adopters in  the region,” said Julian Low, Director of Business Development, South  East Asia, TZ APAC.***  
 

As DSRV begins the official operation  of the baking node, Tezos plans to accelerate cooperation in  sustainable technology development in Korea and the rest of Asia  Pacific. DSRV provides a domestic network for collaboration to develop  the Tezos protocol and will continue to cooperate with Tezos when  developing blockchain infrastructure services in the future.

Tezos has over 400 validators around the world including internationally recognized enterprises as corporate bakers, such as **Coinbase****,** **Ledger****,** **Ubisoft****,** **Exaion**,  and more. Tezos also has a growing DeFi ecosystem with ERC-20 bridges  for low-gas cross-chain utility, yield farming protocols, and surging  AMM platforms.  

Game developers, music labels, sporting franchises, central banks,  and more are all building on Tezos. Other mainstream entities currently  engaging with Tezos for blockchain-based activities include China-based  BSN, ERX, Sygnum Bank, and more.  


TZ APAC aims to empower enterprises and individuals to harness the power of the Tezos  blockchain by providing capital deployment, resource development,  strategic advisory, project management, as well as marketing and  strategic communications services in the region.",1634879219,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd9tej/south_koreabased_dsr_series_a_investment_from_kb/
61,CryptoCurrency,Jcook_14,Does anyone know Moneygram’s volume? (XLM undervalued?),"I have been searching for Moneygrams overall volume but haven’t had much luck. I’m a huge fan of XLM and the Moneygram announcement was a super cool announcement but it has remained virtually unmoved. My thought around this while doing some research was, maybe I could find some fundamental reason that says XLM should be higher right now due to the Moneygram deal. I couldn’t find any volume data for Moneygram, but I did see that they posted a $1,200,000,000 revenue in 2020 and while looking at the fee estimations and saw that there low fee was $2.99 for the most part depending on the amount it could go much higher though. I’m not sure what the fee average is, but I guess I’ll go ahead and estimate $6 because it is double the original and I feel like it is a decently conservative estimate. 

Quick mafs:(1,200,000,000/6)= 200,000,000 transactions if the average fee is that high. And I am unsure of the average amount sent through moneygram, but be imaginative. 200,000,000*10 ($10 average transaction amount) makes it a $2,000,000,000 transaction volume added every year. Doesn’t sound like much at $10 average but if the average transfer is higher, which I’d fancy to say it is by a decent amount, we could be adding serious volume. Yet, no meaningful movement. Am I totally off base here? Is my transaction volume wrong? I’ve searched everywhere for some numbers on Moneygram to try to figure this out, but no luck so far. Please correct me if this post was a waste of energy 😂😅",1634879145,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd9spy/does_anyone_know_moneygrams_volume_xlm_undervalued/

 AOI And PARTNRS group Join Tezos Ecosystem

Today, AOI s.a., becomes the first Luxembourg company to participate  in the Tezos ecosystem as a corporate baker. By officially becoming a  baker, AOI will now validate transactions (blocks) and add them to the  Tezos blockchain.

AOI, as a baker, will have different roles to play in Tezos  governance: in addition to validating the transactions, it will be at  the core of the protocol’s evolution by having voting rights  proportional to the tez (Tezos tokens) it stakes and are delegated to  it.

Tezos is an open-source platform that addresses key barriers facing  blockchain adoption for assets and applications backed by a global  community of validators, researchers, and builders.

AOI will soon launch more services around Tezos and delegation and  has the ambition to become a pro-active participant of the Tezos  ecosystem.

The Tezos ecosystem is built on low-gas fees, cross-chain utility,  yield farming protocols, efficient DEXs, bustling NFT platforms, and  more. With over 5.8 million contract calls in September, Tezos is one of  the fastest growing blockchain ecosystems.

On Tezos, developers are able to easily build powerful decentralized  applications and products. Projects and brands such as Red Bull Racing  Honda, McLaren Racing, OneOf, Ubisoft, Interpop, Hic-Et-Nunc, and more  have chosen to build on the Tezos blockchain.

Upgrades on Tezos are made possible by its proven on-chain  governance, where continuous improvements are proposed by participants  on the network. 

They are voted on, adopted, and deployed without the need to rely on  hard forks. This upgrade mechanism minimizes disruptions while offering  regular upgradability and enhanced functionality over time.

So far, Tezos has undergone seven network upgrades that have reduced  gas fees by 70%, improved token standards, increased transaction speed,  and more.

Cyril Lamorlette, PARTNRS representative, commented:

&gt;“Becoming a corporate baker on Tezos is a very pragmatic illustration of our successful joint venture with INNO! “  
 

Wesley Deglise, AOI’s director and INNO representative said:

&gt;“Open source innovations, such as participating in the governance of  the Tezos network, are not only a compelling concept, but are also a  robust business case as reflected in our decision to become the first  Tezos corporate baker in Luxembourg.”  
 

Alexia Martinel, Adoption Manager in Luxembourg at Nomadic Labs, added:

&gt;“We are particularly delighted to welcome the first Luxembourg  corporate baker to the Tezos ecosystem; thus paving the way for a  growing commitment from the country’s institutional players.”",1634879063,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd9rx1/aoi_and_partnrs_group_join_the_tezos_ecosystem_as/

The International Contemporary Art Fair

Since 1974, the International  Contemporary Art Fair has been a highly anticipated recurring event. For  several days each year, Paris becomes the world capital of contemporary  art.

With an audience of approximately 75,000 visitors, 1,500 artists show  their work in the aisles of the Grand Palais Ephémère, the Tuileries  Gardens, the Musée Eugène Delacroix and Place Vendôme. Amongst the  artists are some of the most famous artists worldwide.

&gt;***“The*** [***FIAC***](https://en.parisinfo.com/paris-show-exhibition/135498/fiac%C2%A0)  ***is also the occasion for an artist residing in France, or of French  origin, to be awarded the prestigious Marcel Duchamp Prize, which brings  with it international recognition. Like all fairs, the FIAC is also a  marketplace where the works of art change hands and professionals meet.***  
 Each year, there is much speculation in the press about the price of  various works of art, which contributes to establishing the legitimacy  of the artists.”  
 

### NFTs on Tezos

For the 14th consecutive year, [House Guerlain](https://www.guerlain.com/) will take part in the International Contemporary Art Fair  in Paris, France. The House will present its new exhibition ‘When  matter becomes art’, from October 21 to November 14, 2021, at 68  Champs-Élysées

House Guerlain  and MNSTR agency will present works of art from four renowned  contemporary artists at the event as NFTs. The NFTs will be displayed in  the multi-level House Guerlain exhibition at the International Contemporary Art Fair. 

*The NFTs will be minted on the  Tezos blockchain, an energy-efficient Proof of Stake network. Tezos, one  of the original pioneers of Proof of Stake, utilizes a significantly  more energy-efficient approach to securing its network.*

Unlike Proof of Work networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Tezos  operates cleanly, with minimal energy consumption and a negligible  carbon footprint.

This collaboration embraces clean NFTs and energy-efficient networks  that ensure that the impact of this new era of creative expression  prioritizes sustainability through innovation.

The NFTs will be sold for the benefit  of the GoodPlanet Foundation, chaired by Yann Arthus-Bertran, a  world-renowned photojournalist and environmentalist.

Since  its creation, Guerlain has encouraged new forms of avant-garde and  artistic innovation, this  exhibition delivers to the world an  experience of imagination and spirit.

The exhibition brings together sculptural works, paintings,  photographs, installations, as well as digital works, NFTs, specially  produced for the occasion, which offer a look at the potential of these  creative territories.

Guerlain’s unique exhibition explores  the question of materiality in art through the works of Liu Bolin,  Lauren Moffatt, Sabrina Ratté, and Constance Valero. All proceeds will  be donated to Yann Arthus-Bertrand’s GoodPlanet Foundation. 

Visual artist Liu Bolin will question  the essence of image, the essence of life, the essence of the world and  our perception of reality in his piece titled, The Last Warrior.  Australian artist Lauren Moffatt will explore the cycles of growth and  decay in nature and how different ecosystems are linked through their  piece titled, Compost VIII.  

Sabrina Ratté will explore a  simulation of ecosystems born from the fusion of technology and organic  matter through her piece titled, Florescendi. Lastly, Constance Valero  will present the supremacy of organic life through her piece titled, De  Nectar et d’Ambroisie.

93,CryptoCurrency,EcstaticFisherman440,"I lost $7,000 worth of Ethereum trading on Uniswap","I'm a moron, I lost $7,000 worth of ETH trading it on the actual, real Uniswap website. Here's how:

I had a littles under 2 ETH ready to be traded for 10 Strong tokens so I could buy a node. The Strong token was only available on Uniswap, and so I funded my Meta Mask with 2 ETH to make the trade.

I searched Uniswap on Bing, and clicked the first result (an ad). Now it did drop me on the correct website, as I checked the link. Also the website did not ask for my wallet seed phrase and my wallet was already connected and showed the balance of ETH. So I concluded I was on the correct website. 

I then initiated the trade, only for my approx. 2 ETH to be deducted from my wallet, but never received the 10 Strong tokens. 

After looking it up on Etherscan, I figured that someone was running an ad on Bing, to the actual Uniswap website, but the link edited the recipient address to their wallet. So in theory as per my understanding, I swapped Eth from my wallet into Strong that went in the scammer's wallet. 

Now the page did show the receipt address and I could remove it too, but I overlooked it and was in a hurry.

You can do ""farming"" where you get small percentage gains in other pointless coins just so other people can swap pointless tokens for other pointless coins (not really a use case- just more speculation).

16,CryptoCurrency,GabeSter,Novi (Facebook money transferring service) isn't related to DIEM the planned FB stable coin - The anti FB moonfarm is out of hand,"I've been meaning to post this for a couple days every since the FB Novi announcement and multiple articles kept popping up with the same ""FB and Privacy don't go together"" or ""Fuck Facebook"" with no meaningful discussion about Novi itself. 

\-----------------------------------------

**What is Novi?**

Novi is essentially a ""money transferring service"" using a stablecoin, Pax Dollar (USDP) available in Guatemala and the US (via waitlist?). This isn't related to their stablecoin they were going to release DIEM and it looks like USDP is the only thing that can currently be transferred through this service.

Their platform currently doesn't have any fees to purchase or send PAXD. Meaning if you buy and send $100 they'll get $100 and can convert it to their local currency or keep the crypto. If I had to guess I'd assume this part is promotional and they'll add fees at another date as adoption increases.  

The website is [here](https://www.novi.com/how-it-works) \- In case you want to look at it further. 

\---------------------------------------

**Lets talk critically** 

Seeing as this isn't related to a FB stablecoin - I'm not entirely sure the hate is warranted - If they ever increase the number of cryptos available to buy/send through them - that would probably be good for crypto adoption as well. 

If that were to ever happen that would make Novi similar to other crypto exchanges with the added benefit of making it easy to send people in ""your FB/IG circle"" (unsure if this is a feature but I'm sure they'd try to implement something like that - long term)

\--------

Sure you could argue it centralizes cryptocurrency which is contrary to crypto - but I'd counterargue most people don't want to take the time/energy to learn DEFI for a truly decentralized use. In any case almost any adoption for crypto is good adoption, right? 

I'm sure you could also try and argue this is a first step towards DIEM which nobody but FB wants and has no counterargument to my knowledge. 

\---------

With all that being said I haven't really seen any valid arguments as to why this service as a whole would be bad - it's just been the anti FB circlejerk, egged on by moon/karma farming. Yes FB doesn't like privacy but what are some actual reasons why FB and privacy make - Novi, a money transferring service bad for crypto? 

I welcome any and all critical feedback as to why Novi would be bad for crypto, and the ""F\*\*\* Facebook"" moon farms alike but lets try and have some meaningful discourse on topic.",1634876111,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd920s/novi_facebook_money_transferring_service_isnt/

30,CryptoCurrency,crua9,So I guess the ATH is playing peekaboo. What does this chart say?,"So I'm going to be using this chart [https://www.tradingview.com/x/q3GhwBqR](https://www.tradingview.com/x/q3GhwBqR)

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to put this out there because I know a lot of people are freaking out over the slight correction (dip). The truth is, this correction doesn't mean anything good or bad. Not yet at least. Looking at the chart unless if it breaks through the channel. I'm seeing this same thing happen about Oct 13 when the price touched the bottom of the channel. 

&amp;#x200B;

The step ladder type of pattern actually is a stronger pattern vs it spiking up. Like the more it jumps the more the dip will be. Where by adding a little time it makes it more stable and we can see this go up to higher ATH vs if it spiked, and the dip after won't be no where near as bad. The downside is the long you take and with how this is still not mainstream. This means the longer the time it takes the more chance there is to a point that the price will just reverse out of no where. This being a whale pulling out for some reason (personal included) to raw manipulation. But on the flip side, the slower it takes to get up, the more stable the price this is, the more open mainstream is to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I start worrying about the price is if it goes below $60k. As I mention prior post I'm not trading anymore until about next year this time or longer. But even if I was, I wouldn't be looking at selling if it hit $59,999. I would however look at that if it hit $55k or $50k.

Referring back to the chart, we can back test the red bar at some point before bouncing back up. But I think by that time it would be questionable at best. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note I'm not a financial advisor. In my person opinion I think within a month we will be looking at about $75k to $80k. It is possible we might see a spike during that time. As I mentioned prior if we are still in the $60k-$80k range by the end of the year. Chances are the bull run will extend to at least Q1 of next year if not Q2.

After creating a MetaMask wallet, decided to transfer 0.01 of an ETH (\~$45) as a trail run. Managed to see my 0.01 ETH in my Metamask wallet, so all good there. But now when I try to swap my ETH to RBC, I get the message that my GAS fee is $60! So essentially, I can't make the swap as I don't even have eough ETH for the fees alone.

Now, I know GAS fees are high, but how do people even manage to buy small cap coins like RBC if the fees are so damn high??? Am i doing something wrong, or is it simply a case of  having to factor that GAS fee into my purchase of small cap coins?

46,CryptoCurrency,CipherScarlatti,Wallets - they're kind of dumb,"Can we talk about how dumb the concept of wallets is for crypto as they currently exist?  
Ca$hApp and Paypal - Yes, you can buy Ethereum and Bitcoin from them. You are buying crypto held by these entities but have no way to transfer out to another wallet. You're just kinda playing crypto roulette. (Buy!) Oh, it went up. (Sell!) It's dipping! (Buy!) I made five bucks!  


You buy Bitcoin at a Coinstar, you have to use CoinMe app.   


But you have a hardware wallet, so you transfer from CoinMe to Trezor.  


You also have a Coinbase account. So you have some stuff on there.  


But you want to try and make an NFT so you move some Eth to MetaMask.  


Am I crazy, or is this incredibly dumb? This is not even including the 10,000 other wallets and services you can use. The fact you could have funds spread over multiple wallets seems crazy and a great way to lose/forget funds. And because of KYC you have to hand out your ID to multiple companies. What happened to the idea of just having transactions, no government involvement?  
Whereas right now my actual carrying wallet has all my credit, debit, ID, gift cards and cash.   
But it's one thing. Yeah, if I lose it, I'm screwed - but it's ONE thing.

62,CryptoCurrency,MuskMiners,US MINER Hosting Market Saturation,"
Ladies. Gentlemen. The US market saturation is real. Electrical costs and hosting rates are pushing higher and higher. 5 cents is the new 3 cents for mining at high scales. 8 cents is the new five cents for hosting. 12+ cents is the new “that’s too expensive but I’ll pay it because I’m still making money and just happy to have hosting”. This is a thing that we will get attacked on. People will comment and say “compass can offer this….” What’s interesting about compass is that they don’t care about up-charging on electrical like most hosters do. They get electrical at 6.5 cents or below, and charge you that rate but make you buy their miner at a 4k+ markup which makes them more money per miner in a five year stretch than a 3 cent markup on an S19. For example: if one S19 pulls 3000 watts at 24hrs/day = 72 KW x 0.03 = $2.16/day x 30day in a month = $64.80/ month in profit for hosting one S19 at a 3 cent markup x 12 months in a year = $777.60/year x 5 years (the projected life of a brand new S19) = $3,888. So if compass gets power at 5 cents and they charge you 8 cents you view that as a bit high, right? So, instead, they are smart enough to charge you 6 cents or 5 cents and REQUIRE you buy their miners that have a 4K + margin which gives them the money right away (more capital on handoff expansion) and makes you think that rate is awesome. Although, how about the 6 month wait to get the miners hosted or the month long response when your miner goes down? One months profit is more than the electrical you’d pay at a smaller facility at 8 cents over a year. So, would you be better going with 8 cents power hosting to avoid long down time and lengthy repairs? Two months down out of the year suggests 11 cents would make sense for uptime and reliability.",1634873076,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd8991/us_miner_hosting_market_saturation/

""They seem to be avoiding short-term default and it's a bit of a relief that they have managed to find liquidity,"" a Hong Kong-based restructuring lawyer representing some bondholders tole Reuters.

""But still, Evergrande does need to restructure its debt. This payment might be a way for them to get some sort of buy-in with stakeholders before the heavy work needed on the restructuring.""

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I purchased a Brand New SecuX hardware wallet (all seals intact) from an Authorized reseller.

3 hours after depositing my funds into the wallet they got cleaned out, now the LCD on the hardware wallet continued to display the previous balance.

&amp;#x200B;

I noted a few issues with the device after that:

1. The photo on the listing was different to the packaging recieved, I recieved no commuinication fo any change, meaning they advertised one box and I got another

2. They say Infineon chip, but I doubt due to the fact the logo on the box isn't the official infineon logo

3. Uncertain of seals on device, the plastic wrap on the very outside was not completely enclosed and it was of a different consistency to that from youtube or other sources 

4. [www.secuxscam.com](https://www.secuxscam.com) tells me of so many security issues

5. A conversation with someone who reviewed the unit tells me it could be easily tampered with and hacked

&amp;#x200B;

How do I go about getting the device looked at i.e. pull the firmware/source code off the device for examination, examine logs and verify authenticity of hardware?

I have 2 conditions placed upon me:

1. The person must be suitably qualified.
2. I must get a good report to explain what happened
3. The person must reside in Australia (preferably Sydney)

Shameful","Lots of scams and shady stuff have come out of this crypto space, but this one really takes the cake. Create a pre-mined coin, backed by 70+ billionaires and then distribute it ""freely"" to over 1 Billion people.. in exchange for your biometrics. 

It tries to tout itself as a ""fairly launched"" coin, but the insiders and VCs keep a huge chunk in yet another example of pre-mined cantillon altcoins. The game plan is to dispatch independent contracts to villages across the world, looking to sign a billion people up for this in promise of a ""free"" crypto token that has entirely been minted without any economic cost. 

[Such a fair distribution. Except our VCs get to keep 20&amp;#37; of it. ](https://preview.redd.it/d01en5foqwu71.jpg?width=3757&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd5ead3d29fd2f0ee466486643e0ea6b985afdf5)

Orb operators get to earn worldcoins for each person they manage to sign up for the scheme. Enter ponzinomics. 

The business model is so simple - a bunch of unethical VCs,  not satisfied with the amount of money they have created for themselves, fund this project and keep a huge allocation for themselves (20%), so if it succeeds they get to become masters of currency while their project contains biometrics of everyone who has signed up. 

The technical model they have adopted is just awful. If it is profitable enough, orb operators who earn for every signup will find a way to game this. They dont have any incentive to stop fraud, as they continue to earn their commission for onboarding more people into the scam. 

The company claims the orb will not store any biometrics, but will use an irreversible function to convert them into a hash that is unique for every person. The problem with such a system is that backdoors could exist, or an orb operator could choose to tamper the device and harvest millions of biometrics for themselves.

If they dont get 20% of the supply, they wont be backing such a project in the first place. None of this is aimed at solving real world problems, it is just a grift to build a massive customer database by promising people ""free"" crypto. Fairest possible distribution? Lol. 

If everyone has something, that something definitely is not very valuable. It will only be valuable to those who have more of it. i.e the founders and the backers. Just a fiat system, backed by corporate grift, that pretends to solve humanity's biggest problems.

42,CryptoCurrency,dragondude4,Why Cryptocurrency is Important For Human Rights and Activism,"The decentralized, uncensorable, and immutable nature of cryptocurrency is a complete economic game-changer for activists and human rights all around the world. 

In the United States and other Western nations, protesting one’s government isn’t a punishable offense, political activism and free speech can't send a person to jail, and being gay won’t find you facing legal punishment. They have first amendment protections and basic human rights. They are truly privileged in that sense. Unfortunately, others many countries around the world don’t have that freedom. Fear of persecution, discrimination, jail time and even death are the associated risks of being an activist. With the pseudonymous/anonymous nature of cryptocurrency, it’s possible to support a cause financially without a paper trail leading back to oneself.

The greatest barrier to any activist movement under a totalitarian regime is having its bank accounts frozen rendering it unable to fund itself. The beauty of cryptocurrency is that its open-source and no one government, entity, or person can control and censor it. It is a global democratic economic model that levels the playing field. This is of particular importance in underdeveloped nations where large swaths of the poor and rural populations are shut out of traditional banking systems, but as they have access to a mobile phone and the internet, which means they can participate in crypto. 

The vast majority of legal change in the world begins with small, local groups advocating for it. Imagine how much faster progress might happen if those groups could do their work without fear of reprisal or persecution because they were operating in a safe and anonymous system.

Things got difficult when the owner of the project had refused to pay out any of the profits that he had once promised to all the investors so that made everyone question the legitimacy of this project.

I saw a couple of large transactions on page two near the bottom that caught my interest, one specifically for 45,927.7395 KTOs that was done 368 days 5 hrs ago on 10-18-2020 and one below it that was done for 325,884.697 645 days and 16 hours ago done on 1-15-2020. It was ironic because the first transaction conduced on 10-18-2020 the price jumped form $1.90 USD to just above $6.50. The team had gifted themselves 25% of the token distribution which was capped at 100M KTO so I am drawing a conclusion that around this time for the first transaction they used an exchange to pump up the price, purchased KTO with investors money and then dumped the coins that they may have held onto the market making a profit. 

I know that there are a lot of smart people on reddit so I was hoping that someone who had some extra time would be able to look at this coin and the etherscan contract address to validate some of the assumptions that I think could have happened. The owner has told investors that he has sold the company and to contact the new owner of the company to get any profits/money back which just seems odd in itself. 

Would appreciate any advice/thoughts on this to help me provide some more information/close the loop on this for my friends so that they can take the next steps (if any) / move on from this as a learning experience to vet projects before handing over any money to a project.

72,CryptoCurrency,Nervous_Sky_5167,Comprehensive Analysis on the Upcoming Alt-season,"# ABSTRACT 

We all know the saying behind 'alt-coins follow Bitcoin', and summarized briefly, it's due to the cumulative cash-flow that is carried by market momentum. A simplified version of this could be represented by the cash flow from Bitcoin -&gt; Ethereum -&gt; Altcoins.

It is undoubtedly true that Bitcoin is in a second-peak cycle, recently just hitting a new all-time high. However, historically with such moves, will a cumulative, follow-up alt-season occur soon after. Timelines are uncertain due to each cryptocurrency's relative size and distribution, but a major alt-season is prophesied to occur anywhere from a few weeks to months. Combined with the reasoning of this prediction, this post will attempt to further explain the macroeconomics behind alt-seasons. 

It's recommended to read a case-study summary of the most recent May alt-season to get caught up: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o20ofs/the\_economics\_behind\_altseasons\_a\_case\_study\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o20ofs/the_economics_behind_altseasons_a_case_study_of/)  


# WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR AN ALT-SEASON

Bitcoin needs a strong, upwards rally that accumulates momentum, enough to sustain a divergence of total crypto market cap v. Bitcoin. In layman's terms, this means a strong Bitcoin that holds its price very well, long enough for alt-season to begin anywhere from a few weeks to months later, dependant on each cryptocurrency's relative size.  

**Case Study #1**

As demonstrated in Figure 1, where Bitcoin's price trend diverges from the rest of the crypto market cap, which will now be referred to as 'Market', causes a power vacuum of cash flow that causes an alt-season. The effects of this initial alt-season are demonstrated in Figure 2 with Ethereum's valuation, and Figure 3 with Cardano's valuation. Needless to say, the effects of divergence and subsequent power-vacuum, and alt-season are quite obvious once modelled under the right circumstances. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1, a graph demonstrating the trend divergence between Bitcoin \(in orange\) and total crypto market cap \(in green\/ red\)](https://preview.redd.it/zj05zwe4dwu71.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc9edfa39c789a4c8be053c6219815bcce5bd024)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2, a graph demonstrating Ethereum's reaction to a Bitcoin v. Market divergence. Note that this is a percentage-based graph, but during this time, Ethereum put a 520&amp;#37; appreciation within 189 days of the divergence. The blue verticle line indicates the start of major divergence. ](https://preview.redd.it/5b5agzkpfwu71.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fcb8db24361929a8660b2d1ad4a84912ea3e6b7)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 3, a graph demonstrating Cardano's \(ADA\) reaction to a Bitcoin v. Market divergence. Note the delayed parabolic move, and how Cardano did not immediately go nuts. This is due to the simplified cash flow model of BTC -\&gt; ETH -\&gt; Alt-coins, denoting that alts like Cardano would get their cash influx much later than bigger coins.](https://preview.redd.it/spqs5cu3gwu71.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6649df930dc0e85d12a5c544474012925fc25389)

**Case Study #2**

Another, more recent example of alt-seasons can be retrieved from the May alt-coin season. As demonstrated in Figure 4, a massive divergence was created from Bitcoin's residual market momentum. Figure 5 portrays Ethereum's reaction to the divergence. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 4, an in-depth comparison of the Market \(in green\/red\) v. Bitcoin \(in orange\). Note the even stronger divergence caused by the cumulative momentum carried by the initial Bitcoin rally to 64k USD. ](https://preview.redd.it/mhg4gm1qhwu71.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69f2f8b87fc861219a9425d01151f03262d430ea)

Please note this chart is on a percentage-based scale, but within the timeframe of the most recent divergence, caused a massive 200&amp;#37; appreciation by Ethereum.  ](https://preview.redd.it/byya01h6iwu71.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcb9478682d0167a3fea4ee536e114b2f121f68)

# CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF A DIVERGENCE, AND PREDICTIONS

Due to Bitcoin's second leg of the bull-run to a new all-time high, there seems to be another divergence forming, as demonstrated in Figure 6 and insinuated by Bitcoin's current price trend. As a result, as you could've already guessed, Ethereum is already tagging along, just recently hitting a close high of 4.4k USD, as demonstrated in Figure 7. Of course, other altcoins like Cardano, who lie closer to the bottom of the simplified cash-flow sequence of BTC -&gt; ETH -&gt; Alt-coins, are lying dormant, if not, even going down, as demonstrated in Figure 8! But don't worry, with time, even your pet project of an alt-coin will rise up. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 6, a new divergence forming is portrayed between the Market \(in green\/ red\) and Bitcoin \(in orange\), represented in a percentage scaled graph.](https://preview.redd.it/adyyswvujwu71.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b67e387b49b52d4b0412516abae9b227c838d0c6)

# TO CONCLUDE

Another alt-season is almost set in stone to happen, and depending on your cryptocurrency's relative size, is to happen from within a few weeks to months, excluding Ethereum of course, which I personally do not consider as an alt-coin. 

I hope this due diligence helped clear up all the recent spewed-out copypasta of how cash-flow works in the cryptocurrency space.

97,CryptoCurrency,ripple_mcgee,How I Earn Crypto in Crypto - A Journey (Long),"I thought I would share my journey in crypto thus far, from a lowly noob to a somewhat seasoned noob. My dream, obviously, is to lambo, but I will settle for earning a slightly better than living wage from crypto while being able to do absolutely nothing except explore my hobbies and passions. 

It all started with the silk road :)  I was purchasing 'certain goods' and I needed this cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. Hard to come by in those days (2013-2015), you either had to mine it or meet up with someone who would sell it to you for cash. Some exchanges existed, but none where I lived. What is sad to think about is that in the past I have held \~10 BTC on various marketplaces/wallets entirely for purchasing 'certain goods'. I also have 0.6 BTC out there in the aether somewhere, lost when Dream Marketplace shutdown. The lesson I learned here was that no amount of crypto is too small and leaving 'dust' in an old wallet or service might lead to regret.

My next big foray into crypto was mining. I got into mining a couple years back. I bought 5 graphics cards, a multi-GPU motherboard and rigged up a contraption out of wood and metal to hold it all together. 

[https://imgur.com/a/L5J0cAj](https://imgur.com/a/L5J0cAj)

This has been my best crypto investment by far. It cost maybe $3k and has earned me ETH non-stop, which I never sold (more about that later). I eventually expanded on my rig, sold off some older cards and now I'm mining with 10 AMD Radeon VII @ 1000 MH/s. This works out to about $90 USD per day. I remember when I was about to start this project, the economics of it did not work out! I was going to lose money every month mining ETH from electricity costs. It was a big risk, but it paid off.

Now the biggest risk. I took a loan from a bank...five figures...to buy 32 ETH to run a validator on the Ethereum 2.0 network. I asked my parents for a loan, but they are boomers and did not understand the investment. So I took this fiat loan, bought the ETH and set up the validator, which went online in Dec 2020. The value of the crypto has 10x since then and I laugh at my parents every time they try to talk about crypto to me. But I'm still trying to pay down the bank loan, which is hard because rates are so low right now...but I know that won't last long.

Here is the guide I followed to set up my validator: requirements are basic Linux commands and desire to learn [https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-2-0-ubuntu-prysm-56f681646f74](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-2-0-ubuntu-prysm-56f681646f74)

Now the last piece of the puzzle. Put your crypto to work! Was it Warren Buffett who said 'you wont get rich until you figure out a way to earn money while you're asleep'?     Well, enter DeFi. 

I took my ETH earnings and tossed them into DeFi protocols all over the place until I found some that worked well. Yield farming is still lucrative. I have two primary stakes:

1. Aave. I practice what's called 'recursive borrowing' on the polygon network. Think of it like fractional reserve banking for the individual. I use my ETH as collateral and borrow DAI. I then deposit my borrowed DAI to increase my collateral to borrow yet more DAI. This continues until I max out my borrow limit, roughly 3x. The APY on this is around 14% and low-medium risk. [https://www.publish0x.com/ethereum-explained/7-stablecoins-farming-strategies-to-earn-up-to-54-percent-ap-xvwgjmg](https://www.publish0x.com/ethereum-explained/7-stablecoins-farming-strategies-to-earn-up-to-54-percent-ap-xvwgjmg) 
2. Balancer. The coins/tokens I have that are not compatible with Aave (such as LINK) I invest into the Balancer protocol and earn crypto through swap fees and Liquidity mining incentives. This is only worth it if the incentives are high enough. Current APY on this is 36% and medium-high risk.

That's it. I do a couple other things: [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) credit card and earn cashback in crypto, brave browser usually brings in like $5 usd a month. Yeah. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; bought bitcoin for silk road, then started mining, then ran up an ETH 2.0 validator, now all up in the DeFi to make my crypto earn more crypto. This is the way!

Richard Heart is also launching a brand new Ethereum fork that isn't unusable for the average person.  It is called PulseChain, currently in Testnet phase, and launching to Mainnet soon.

Hex is great because explaining it is very simple.  It's Bitcoin with a proof of work change (proof of wait  instead).  Hex is a more usable Bitcoin.  It copies parameters from conventional certificates of deposit, and applies them to a slowly inflating (\~4%/year) Blockchain token where YOU mint your own rewards and enjoy the fruit of the token's inflation depending on how long you are willing to delay your  gratification.  It's like if the FED money printer payed out to YOU and not big banks and associated third parties (that aren't The People) meanwhile de-valuating good money with bad money.

12,CryptoCurrency,graph_marine,"MIT Bitcoin core developers and researchers apply for and receive $50,000 grant from The Graph Foundation, a community-governed organization for the The Graph (ticker: GRT), a widely-adopted decentralized indexing protocol","**Background:**

The Graph is an incentivized indexing protocol for the entirety of Web 3.0. To describe what this means, let's say you were opening a bookstore. You have two options: you can either stack all of the books randomly on the shelves for customers to search through manually, or you can organize the books in several different ways (alphabetical order, by topic, by author, by genre, etc.)

Before The Graph, Ethereum and other blockchain networks were sort of like the first example - just an unorganized blob of random data. The Graph's protocol enables users from around the world to organize (index) data on blockchains and makes it easier for developers to retrieve such data. Prior to this innovative solution to unorganized ""big data"" on-chain, developers had to organize all on-chain data manually before creating their decentralized applications (dapps). This would take months-years to complete, in addition to significant developer energy/resources. Multicoin Capital, an early investor in many prominent blockchain networks and dapps such as Solana, describes The Graph's ability to scale reads and writes on-chain as [one of the most, if not the most, powerful tools in the blockchain developer stack](https://multicoin.capital/2021/07/30/scaling-reads-and-writes/). Kyle Samani, the founder of Multicoin, says The Graph is [probably the most requested piece of infra(structure) in the Solana ecosystem](https://twitter.com/KyleSamani/status/1433276276714975232?s=20).

Now, using The Graph, on-chain data is significantly easier to access and retrieve, which allows developers to allocate more of their time creating dapps rather than wasting it on building the database that the dapps require to function. This is why there was a ""big boom"" of dapps (mainly DeFi apps) in 2019, right after The Graph launched its protocol. Examples are vast and include Uniswap, Sushiswap, Aave, Pancakeswap, Synthetix, Compound, MakerDAO, USDC, iExec, PoolTogether, Audius, Dodo, Ren, 1Hive, Gnosis, Tether, wBTC, wETH, EIP-721 and EIP-1155 standards (all NFTs and NFT applications), Kleros, Arweave, Kyber, the list goes on (there are more than 22,000 subgraphs).

At this point in time, The Graph is processing over 1 billion queries **per day** across 24 different supported blockchain networks including, but not limited to, Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, and more. If The Graph were to stop working, the dapps running on these networks would cease functioning. 

**The Graph Foundation Wave 3 Grant &amp; MIT's Bitcoin Core Developer Group**

As the title states, MIT Bitcoin Core Developers applied for and received a $50,000 grant from The Graph Foundation, which is a community-governed organization that helps to maintain and govern the decentralized indexing protocol, [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) (ticker: [GRT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-graph)).

At this point in time, I am not sure exactly what they intend to use the grant money for. However, there has been much speculation surrounding this topic and I am going to briefly partake in this speculation with this thread. 

&gt;Source 2: [The Graph Foundation allocates over $1.5M in Grants, Ecosystem &amp; Dev Support in Wave 3](https://thegraph.com/blog/wave-three-funding)  
&gt;  
&gt;Source 2: [MIT's Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu/bitcoin-security-initiative)

Back in February, 2021, The Graph announced that they ultimately [intend to index Bitcoin's main network](https://thegraph.com/blog/multiblockchain-support). What this means is that they would take all of the unorganized big data on Bitcoin's network and reorganize it into easier-to-read subsections of the Bitcoin network. 

Think about it, if a developer wanted to create a decentralized application using Bitcoin's network (such as a decentralized exchange centered around Bitcoin) right now, it would take months-years to sort through the 10 years worth of data on the Bitcoin network. Plus, Bitcoin doesn't even have smart contract capabilities on its native network (though with The Graph, subgraphs dedicated to Bitcoin could be used to build smart contracts with Bitcoin data, bit I digress). The Graph takes all of this data and makes it organized and easily readable so that any developer who creates a dapp can simply design a subgraph within The Graph's network and build a Bitcoin dapp using this subgraph.

Once The Graph indexes the Bitcoin network, I predict we will see a huge boom in developer interest in Bitcoin dapps and thus in the development of dapps centered around the Bitcoin ecosystem. This will lead to immense innovation using Bitcoin and its native network and overall increased activity in the cryptocurrency space. It also goes to show how powerful the infrastructure of The Graph protocol is.

So they go about conducting transactions without thinking about the costs involved. 

As a result, they end up wasting a lot of money without knowing it.

This happens mostly through transaction fees from thoughtless trades and other on-chain activities.

For example, when you stake $20 with a total of $1.5, you have just spent 25% (1/4) of your money on transaction fees.

You'll need to earn rewards worth that much just to break even, and it's gonna take weeks, months or even years, depending on the APR you're getting.

So before making your next transaction, think. 

Except you're playing it for the very long term, spending such high percentage of your investment in fees is a good way to remain poor.",1634864305,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd5qun/the_1_way_youre_losing_a_lot_of_money_in_crypto/

So I wanted to share my process to help out other newbies and potentially help give ideas to help you implement a similar process. 

1. At first, I wanted to watch every new coin being made, reality is you're really limited to the platform you use. I'm on KuCoin so I've begun watching every new coin that's listed there. Whatever platform you're on that's where you'll want to check what's newly listed daily. This is also nice because it's a filter, I know at least the coins making it onto KuCoin have had to prove themselves in some form. 
2. Next, look at market cap, anything less than 30m is ripe but if the fully diluted market cap is insane like 2 billion it's a dud imo, there's too many locked coins soon to release working against price appreciation. So, ideally less than 30 million market cap and less than 250 million fully diluted. Now we've found a coin that's small but passed through KuCoin and has potential. Time to research it! 
3. Finally, check to see if it's a coin that's actually growing in popularity. Look at Google trends for the name, check the growth rate of its subreddit, how active is their subreddit and how many members online. Find YouTube videos and also learn more about the coin. I want something that has substance to it, meaning it's an upcoming game, exchange, platform, service, not just a transfer of wealth but has utility. 

This is what am doing, feel it identifies certified exchange approved coins, with big growth potential, and has noise being made/growing in fanbase. Then just put in a couple bucks and aim to sell 50% after 5x-10x and keep the rest to go long for potential crazy moonshot.

Former founder of Bitcoin Foundation Gavin Andresen, recently wrote a blog he called “A Possible Bitcoin Future”. In this blog he predicts the demise of Bitcoin. 

He says that in 2061 that every Bitcoin will be worth $6 million per coin. He admitted that it could seem like science fiction but it is entirely possible. He explains how transaction fees would be around $7,500 but most would be on the actual Bitcoin network itself. Most transactions would be on mirrored chains using wrapped tokens to save on fees and improve speed. He adds that whales would control entire thing, would continue to still transact on the main Bitcoin chain however recognizing by 2100 that the mining fees would be at a near zero.

The demise of the Bitcoin network itself was explained by Andresen saying “Eventually, there are zero new Bitcoin being produced on the Bitcoin network, and zero Bitcoin network. There is nothing left to secure, and the chain stops.” He adds this however that there will still be 20 million Bitcoin moving on other networks securing its scarcity value.

Mathematically, the last Bitcoin is going to be mined in 2140.  Right now there are 2.17 million or 10.5% left to be mined.

94,CryptoCurrency,dmiddy,"Your Chosen ""Ethereum Killer"" Is Going To Be Eaten By Ethereum Layer 2s, It Just Doesn't Know It Yet","This idea was recently popularize by twitter user [https://twitter.com/epolynya](https://twitter.com/epolynya)

With the launch of two Layer 2 scaling solutions, Optimism and Arbitrum, it is now a false equivalency to be comparing your chosen layer 1 blockchain to Ethereum.  

Eventually, the average Ethereum user will not interact with layer 1, therefore the layer 2s will be processing the bulk of activity on the chain.  

When you look at Solana/BSC and see amazing TPS and cheap fees, you must compare that to what Eth layer 2 scaling solutions can handle(which is much, much more than Solana).  

Once the miniscule and instant transactions of layer 2 Ethereum draw you in, you can rest easy knowing that you've just transacted on one of the most Decentralized blockchains available today.  

**Solana, BSC = Monolithic blockchain = trying to do everything in one layer = centralization**  

**Ethereum = Modular blockchain = splitting up tasks into layers = preserve decentralization**  

"" **Anything any monolithic blockchain (L1) can ever do, a single zkRollup can do it significantly (&gt;10x) better. And there can be hundreds or thousands of zkRs interoperating relatively seamlessly.** ""  

&amp;#x200B;

A zkRollup is a technique in which transactions are batched off-chain and settled on-chain. Put more simply, it is a much more efficient usage of block space on Ethereum Layer 1.  

Instead of 1 transaction taking up 1 transaction worth of block space, Layer 2s allow for many transactions to occupy that space.  

Add on to this that there can be ""hundreds or thousands"" of rollup projects operating at the same time, and modular blockchains have solved scalability and thus have solved the [Scalability Trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition)

Ethereum, Tezos, Cardano, and others have seen that monolithic architecture is extremely limiting in the long-term, even if it provides short-term advantages.  

What's more, *monolithic blockchains are more likely to pivot to becoming rollups for Ethereum than they are to kill it.*  

Once projects realize that all the users are on Ethereum, they will understand that the best decision they can make to improve their project is to pivot away from being their own monolithic chain.

The future lies in Modular Blockchains.

6,CryptoCurrency,ChaoticNeutralNephew,Econ 101- What is Impermanent Loss?,"[https://cryptorobin.com/what-is-impermanent-loss/](https://cryptorobin.com/what-is-impermanent-loss/)

[Tania](https://cryptorobin.com/author/cryptotania/) 16 June, 2021

In this article, I will briefly explain what Impermanent Loss means and how this phenomenon can affect the profit of liquidity providers.

&amp;#x200B;

### How Do We Characterize Impermanent Loss?

This concept reflects the temporary loss of a part of the liquidity owned.

The phenomenon occurs within liquidity pools, where the liquidity provider must include proportional amounts of 2 different tokens.

If one of the tokens is more requested, then the proportion of the two assets in the pool changes.

In case the provider now decides to withdraw their assets from the liquidity pool, they risk not recovering the entire amount and in the proportion in which they have deposited it.

### Practical Case of Impermanent Loss – How Two Assets Equate in a Pool

To support the funds of an AMM, person X deposits 1 ETH and 100 DAI in a liquidity pool at a 50/50 ratio.

The amounts of the deposited tokens must have an equivalent value.

In the case described, this means that the price of 1 ETH is 100 DAI at deposit time. 

Also, let’s say that the current dollar value of person X’s deposit is $200.

If the total in that pool (also supported by other providers) is 10 ETH and 1,000 DAI, person X holds a 10% share of the fund, and the total liquidity is 10,000.

### How Does Impermanent Loss Occur?

In this case, let’s suppose that the ETH price increases to 400 DAI.

If this happens, arbitrage trading strategies will add DAI to the pool and remove ETH until the ratio reflects the current price.

Since AMMs don’t work with order books, the price of the assets is given by their ratio in the pool.

In short, if the liquidity remains constant in the fund (10,000), the ratio of the assets in it changes.

&amp;#x200B;

### How Many Funds Does the Provider Get?

If ETH has come to be 400 DAI, the ratio of the existing ETH and DAI amounts in the pool has changed. 

There are now 5 ETH and 2,000 DAI in common, but if person X decides to withdraw their funds, they are entitled to 10% of that pool.

So, they can only withdraw 0.5 ETH and 200 DAI, totaling $400.

Although profits of $200 resulted, the amount would have been different if they had continued to hold 1 ETH and 100 DAI.

The combined dollar value of these assets would now have been $500.

### Conclusions

The loss was not substantial, as the original deposit was a relatively small amount.

In other circumstances, the impermanent loss may result in the loss of a significant part of the original deposit.

Our example completely ignores the trading fees that the provider would have earned.

In many cases, the earned fees can cancel losses and make supplying liquidity profitable.

It is crucial to understand the concept before providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol.",1634860283,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd4l2a/econ_101_what_is_impermanent_loss/

20,CryptoCurrency,Psychological-Ad1433,Rebase for dummies: the latest bsc scam,"I’ve seen quite a few people ask about rebase tokens so I thought I might be able to help explain.

It’s a weird system for sure. They reduce the total supply so your coins disappear over time but the value of them stays the same as a percentage of market cap.

Napkin math, say ya buy in at 100k mc for $100 you get 25b coins, every time they rebase the token ya lose coins. 

If it hits 200k mc you now have $200 but ya don’t have 25b anymore, depending how many times they rebased it could be 20b or maybe even as low as 12.5b or lower if they had to pump the chart due to sell offs. 

Your coin count depends on how many times they rebased but the value of your investment is entirely based on the market cap.

The entire concept is designed to make it look good on the charts, if the price of each coin keeps going up the chart makes people especially new investors think that this is a good buy or they get fomo and buy in without really understanding how rebase works.",1634859731,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd4f7y/rebase_for_dummies_the_latest_bsc_scam/

Lets start with the obvious: hype

I heard this a lot that, many got into crypto by getting doge shilled by their friends who probably is also fairly new to crypto. We are basically flock animals and we seek confirmation and advice from friends and family.

The promise of great return

Maybe the same friend who shilled you dogecoin convinced you by telling you how high doge could go without knowing anything about marketcap. 

Quantity over quality

For the same reason people like all-you-can-eat buffet. Moar is better!

The price psychological aspect

This one I actually saw the first time with ADA. Some b celebrity was shilling ADA by tweeting that it’s way cheaper than BTC. It’s kinda like the previous aspect that you get more for cheap, but in the end a 20% gain will also be a 20% gain.

26,CryptoCurrency,lilbugpal,Cardano is basically dead. People just don't realise it yet.,"Cardano's throughput is currently incredibly low.

The ***best case*** is 6.5tps. This is hardly more than Bitcoin.

The worst case is significantly lower.

https://i.imgur.com/sIglkyi.jpeg

---

This is not currently an issue, as Cardano's blocks are not full. They're currently sitting at about 30% full.

However, if any adoption/usage of smart-contracts arises (DeFi, NFTs, etc) then Cardano is very quickly going to start hitting 100% full blocks, every single block.

Cardano does not have a fee market, so when blocks are full, there's no way to ensure your transaction goes through. Got an important transaction that you need to be processed quickly? Big institution that needs to send 2 billion ADA? Bad luck, you can't pay more to ensure it goes through fast. 

This is an absolute hellscape.

---

Then there's this; https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/3247

Recently, some NFTs were causing spikes in Cardano's usage, causing bottlenecks for several hours, causing many peoples transactions to be 'dropped', because they could not be inserted into the mempool.

In the comments, Duncan Coutts (one of Cardano's top devs) replied.

His solution? They would decide which transactions are more important, and process them first... He has decided that NFTs are not important, and get low priority. Wow... wasn't this meant to be decentralised? Why are they making decisions about which transactions are more important? They should all be treated equally. ***THIS IS A HUGE CENTRALISATION RED FLAG.*** 

Then there's the mempool being overfilled. His solution? When the mempool is full, wallets need to keep attempting to submit the transaction to the mempool, over and over and over, possibly for days, until they successfully get it inserted... 

This means that when you send a transaction, you need to ensure your wallet stays connected to the internet - so it can keep trying to publish your transaction. If you send some ADA then turn off your computer/phone? Bad luck, your transaction wont go through. This is absolute insanity.

This is all incredibly troubling.

Again, this is not really an issue ***YET***, because blocks/mempool are not consistently full yet. But they will be as soon as there's any significant level of smart-contract usage.

---

The solution to this is Cardanos Layer 2 scaling solution; Hydra. 

Unfortunately, Hydra is likely many years away, and until then, Cardano is basically dead in the water, unable to deal with any significant level of adoption of smart-contract usage.",1634859191,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd49i1/cardano_is_basically_dead_people_just_dont/

52,CryptoCurrency,tishous,Why I believe Cardano can 3-5x in price in the coming few months.,"Whether you love it or hate it, Cardano, and its native token ADA, has become one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world, with a market capitalization of just over $70 billion at the time of writing. Since this time last year, ADA's price has increased by more than 210 times. So you might be wondering, how can it even 3x in price, let alone 5x, after it has increased so much already?

&amp;#x200B;

Well there are a few reasons in my opinion:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Comparison to Ethereum, and what it could mean.**

Ethereum's market capitalization is currently $485 billion. In other words, Ethereum's market cap is currently \~6.8x that of Cardano's. A popular opinion in this subreddit is that Ethereum will reach $10k by the end of 2021, or roughly a 2.5x from here. If Cardano was to simply keep pace with Ethereum, then ADA would too increase by 2.5x (to a market cap of about $170 billion). However, from previous bull cycles we can extrapolate that ADA (and other alt coins) will outpace both BTC and ETH once they've had their runs. For instance, in the 2017/2018 bull market, the ETH/ADA pair reached a high of 0.0014. If ETH reached $10k, this would put ADA at $14. Reaching these levels are unlikely, as it would put Cardano at a $460 billion market cap, but even if the pair reached 0.0007, a level below even what we saw earlier this year, it would be a $7 ADA. For context, this would be a 3.25x from ADA's current price.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Retail FOMO.**

ADA looks ""cheap"". What I mean by that is compared to all other coins in the top 20 by market cap, with the exception of stablecoins, ALGO, and XRP, it is the only coin with a single digit price. New retail investors, who will undoubtedly start investing in crypto once BTC has already far surpassed its previous ATH, will likely think it is going to reach the prices of ETH and BTC due to lack of knowledge about market cap, circulating supply, and anything else which almost guarantees it is impossible to reach even half the price of Ethereum. This isn't wild speculation either, as we saw almost this exact thing happen in the previous leg up after BTC's ATH. In May of this year, Ethereum Classic quadrupled in price, in a matter of a week, due to uninformed retail investors believing it was the correct ""Ethereum"" to invest in as it had a cheaper price. This isn't a new concept either, as meme coins, such as Doge and Shiba Inu, experienced similar situations just in this year alone. Uninformed, or perhaps misinformed, investors saw the cheap price of these coins and thought they could get rich once they reached $1. I'm not saying ADA is a meme coin, or that retail investors shouldn't buy it, but the pyschology of, ""if I put $1000 in now, I'll have $2 million by the time it reaches Ethereum's price"", still applies and may cause it to skyrocket in price. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Market sentiment.**

This point is arguably the most speculative out of the three points, but market sentiment around ADA is similar to that back in July/August. While Bitcoin was rising quite fast to $52k, ADA was largely stagnant, consolidating around the $1.30 area. Despite the couple of months of barely any movement, ADA then proceeded to explode to above $3 (2.3x increase in a couple of weeks) due to the release of smart contracts. Keep in mind, this was when Bitcoin was at $52k, so the retail FOMO hadn't even started yet. Similarly, while Bitcoin has increased by 60% in less than a month, ADA has barely increased whatsoever since late September. In both circumstances, then and now, people are generally bored with Cardano and its lack of movement, and as we've seen, it can go parabolic any time with or without a catalyst (like in 2017). With this in mind, I believe a larger increase in price than in August/September will occur once retail FOMO really starts, possibly later this year, or early next year, depending on what the price of Bitcoin does.

&amp;#x200B;

All three of these reasons are why I believe ADA can reach at least $6 by the end of this bull run, if not higher. If the stars align perfectly, $10 isn't unrealistic seeing as how it would have a market cap of $330 billion, at a time when predictions put Bitcoin at a market cap of higher than $1.8 trillion and Ethereum at a market cap of higher than $1.2 trillion. Furthermore, with the released of PAB, where smart contracts will become easier implement and integrate into wallets and websites, Cardano's ecosytsem will likely to continue growing, so likely its price will too.

FTX.US dropped from 66.4k bitcoin to 52k. FTX dropped to 58k. Other exchanges dropped more or less as liquidity absorbed the drop differently on each individual exchange. Bots look at each exchange and every bot looks at Bitcoin to determine what to do with other coins. Since Binance.US had such a major drop, every coin on every exchange was affected by a so called ""bug"" that coincidentally happened within minutes of ETH hitting and all time high.

On Binance.US, buy/sell orders were triggered all the way down to 8k Bitcoin. Trades WERE executed at this level on Binance.US. Other trades were executed at there respective levels on each exchange as the market tanked nearly instantly. 

Why are people just shrugging this off? A 2 trillion dollar + market was instantly tanked within minutes based off an illiquid exchange that said it was a ""bug"" that happened in the minute ETH was at and/or breaking an all time high. We STILL haven't recovered from this nearly 12 hours later.",1634857207,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd3nkl/so_were_all_just_going_to_ignore_the_insane_80/
69,CryptoCurrency,ThrowAwaydntopnddins,How I get anyone in my circle to adopt Bitcoin,"I gift them Bitcoin to their email via an exchange that allows that, like Coinbase, or Celsius, etc, on their Birthdays or Christmas's. Then I tell them that they have 30 days to open an account to collect, otherwise the Bitcoin goes back into my wallet. 

Once they open their accounts to collect the sats, they end up with some Bitcoin to look at in their own wallet appreciating in value over time, that they can move to wherever they want whenever they want, and most importantly, an exchange account to start DCAing more Bitcoin once the gifted Bitcoin does it's job and peaks their curiosity with its appreciation.

Though, when they start asking me how to buy more, I usually direct them to Coinbase Pro so they can get the least amount of fees as possible and actual fair market value, instead of getting charged ridiculously high fees and even crazier upcharges, if they were to buy on Coinbase's normal app.

The longest it has taken one of my gifts to get someone starting to accumulate BTC is two years. They kick themselves now for not starting sooner. The gift was $50 bucks of Bitcoin in feb 2019, by the time they started buying in 2021, the gift was worth $700 bucks of Bitcoin.",1634856787,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd3ize/how_i_get_anyone_in_my_circle_to_adopt_bitcoin/

74,CryptoCurrency,NeverDeadlyy,I have found my opportunity to jump further into the crypto game!!!,"Hello fellow Crytofucks

I hope you are all having a great season of all this craziness. Now I have a couple of stacks to work with and I'm looking into investing more into the Crypto world. I want to be prepared and look into more altcoins. I may ask some dumbass questions that may possibly have the simplest of answers so I do ask you guys to please BEAR with me here and to avoid posting BULL shit comments. See what I did there? I know fucking corny right?

anyways, let's carry on...

Of course, BTC is king and ETH follows behind making them the 2 obvious choices to get into. Now would DCAing into these coins at this point be a good idea? Should I wait it out (fuck that) How exactly can I begin this investment strategy when it comes to a DCA method. What are some great days to set up for weekly investments into such coins? How much should I put in every time? Now, these questions may be left up to me to answer but would also love some input from the community.

I am familiar with some other coins such as ALGO, ADA, Matic, Sol, Link, Tezos, yadda yadda yadda.

What are some methods to going about these coins? What coins do YOU have more confidence in? What projects are you invested in and WHY?  I'm pretty heavy into ALGO atm and the rewards are satisfying. I just want to prepare for what is to come.

Right now there is a heavy flow of money moving into Bitcoin causing prices to surge eventually will we see Large Caps going parabolic? And regardless of Market cap, at some point, some altcoins with strong fundamentals will begin to go through pumps leading into Alt Season. I want to be ready for this shit. So I would appreciate any information that will benefit me in the long run.

I'm excited. I'm a noob and this is my first path to Alt Season. I'm happy to be a part of it and open to learning with each passing day.",1634856602,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd3gy2/i_have_found_my_opportunity_to_jump_further_into/

Appears to be funded by trades, and they use it to pay out giveaways, raffles, etc...  They also seem to be sending large sums of ETH to a 3rd wallet through a bunch of small ""middle"" wallets.

Example:

* [https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1ad4ed9952025eacc264a0855233b3ce6f13eb7](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1ad4ed9952025eacc264a0855233b3ce6f13eb7) \- 9 ETH from the main wallet they use for giveaways (**0xb1ad4ed9952025EacC264A0855233B3CE6F13eb7**) to this wallet: **0xa711bda9ed7bc3fbb05bd440156f5ac06e0ec162**
   * This wallet only has three transactions:
      * 9.4 ETH IN from (token)
      * 8.5 ETH IN from (sibling token)
      * 18 ETH OUT (see below)
* [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa711bda9ed7bc3fbb05bd440156f5ac06e0ec162](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa711bda9ed7bc3fbb05bd440156f5ac06e0ec162) \- 18 ETH from **0xa711bda9ed7bc3fbb05bd440156f5ac06e0ec162** to **0xE9BE58847e709a64B8298F571E0EEd43d90a21D6**
   * This wallet contains over $1million in ETH

The pattern repeats many times, and those ""middle"" wallets always only have one or two IN transactions, followed by an OUT to the big wallet.

I inquired with the dev on TG, and was informed the big wallet was a ""Tax wallet"".  I asked if there was any reason it goes through all those other wallets, and the response was simply ""No"".  Haven't been able to get any more info since.

93,CryptoCurrency,Cueshark29,I did an experiment and bought $100 of each of the 'top gainers' on coinmarketcap. Discovered a new scam in the process.,"Just for shits and giggles I bought a small quantity of two coins from the coin market cap website's 'top gainers'.

About $100 of each.

INX (infinityX) and BitUp.

I got them through Pancakeswap.  Both of them are /WBNB.  They still appear on coinmarket cap even though they literally reduce the amount of coins from your wallets AFTER you've bought them.

When I first purchased INX this morning I had 19.5 billion.  But then later in the day I noticed that the amount in my metamask had reduced to 3.5 billion.  Then later in the day it had reduced even further to 96 million.

Then I checked the twitter page and there were loads of other people with the same issue.  Having their coins stolen right from their wallets.

The other coin BitUp did exactly the same.  I had 35,000 coins which then reduced to 18,000 after about an hour.  Luckily I managed to swap these back to WBNB to salvage what I could.

I can't imaging FOMOing big money into one of these coins.  Then to watch your stash reduce and reduce into nothing.  Not just the price of the coin but your actual bags.

I had no idea that this was even possible.  It allows for such ridiculous scamming.

I thought that if you had coins in your metamask wallet the number of coins was absolutely safe and nothing could change that.  But this is not true.  These shitcoins can literally steal your coins from your own wallets.

Be careful with buying coins like this.  The top gainers on CMC are basically traps for scams like this.  If I chose 2 coins and they both operated like this then it only means that many others are also doing this.",1634855513,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd34nm/i_did_an_experiment_and_bought_100_of_each_of_the/

We thought all hope was lost. None of us lost hope. We always believed that there'd come a day when it recovers. Slowly, but surely, the price of Bitcoin and the entire crypto marketplace recovered.

Fast forward 4 months. 20th October 2021. Crypto, spearheaded by bitcoin hits it's heavy resistance. There's been much turmoil in its path. FUD, fake news, market manipulation, and fuckin China. Were we doomed to stagnate?

We had hope. But we needed a savoir. A catalyst to break the bonds of the resistance. That savior was the one whom we forgot. The one who was martyred for humanity's greed, ignorance and stupidity. Regardless, he returned to save us from the perils of the bear market. Our savior, Harambe had risen us out of it by having a statue installed in NYC to combat the Bull and Bear.

Fellow crypto-enthusiasts,

Even though the general opinion is to HODL, with the new BTC ATH, I'm starting to think about the best ways to take some profit. Of course my biggest fear at the moment is to time it badly and take my Coins out, before they really start to pump, this is even a bigger fear (or greed?) than that the market is crashing again. 


What type of strategies do you have to take some profits during the Bullruns? Do you just DCA out like you DCA in when the market is down or do you have any goals, where you're happy with taking your Coins out after reaching them? Or do you just continuously byu more in hope of a much bigger Bullrun in the unknown future?

My second problem is, that while some of my Coins gained much in value, I have some, I bought during a pump and dump and I don't know, if they will ever recover. If you think, your badly performing coins won't grow again, do you just take your loss, while your overall Portfolio is positive or do you HODL, no matter, how safe the future of your Coins is?

The trading site I use allows people to post comments relating to specific cryptos or stocks, so I was casually reading through the feed of XRP to see if there's a reason it had dropped.

Turns out the poor guy had bought XRP and a few other coins at the all times highs and must've been inactive for a while but checked his account after and realised he was in the deepest depths of the reds and just jumped on the bandwagon of hating on Elon and whales.

Crypto exchange group FTX announced on Thursday the close of a fundraising round that values the company at $25 billion, adding $420.69 (nice) million to its war chest to make acquisitions and launch new products.

The announcement come just a few months after they announced that they had raised $900m in an earlier Series B funding round. 

Per the announcement, FTX's new funding round included participation from 69 (nice) investors including Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, and ""funds and accounts managed by BlackRock."" Other participants include Lightspeed Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Sea Capital. 

What are the odds of this ever happening? Was it a pre-decided target they wanted to reach? I can understand limiting investors to 69 (nice), but how do you raise exactly $420.69m (nice)?

Earlier, Elon Musk tweeted something an image of a couple looking at the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum sitting at $69k (nice) and $4.2k, respectively. 

It is safe to assume that retail investors, especially the younger demographic are being increasingly targeted.

If you feel overwhelmed just take a break.","I am into Crypto for 5 months i really enjoy it. In my mid 30s, maybe for some might be late but i think that you are never too late when it's about Crypto, because we are all still early. It is a brave new world for me, the whole concept, the trading, the tech, the future opportunities, the use cases and last but not least the profits of course. 

I have no doubt that Crypto will be a significant part of my life in the future, but what worries me that recently I'm too devoted. When i wake up i check the charts, every free time i have i learn, when i go to sleep i check the charts, damn it sometimes i check the charts every 10-20 minutes. I'm invested into the sub as well, because it's a great source of information and fun.

Problem is that recently i catch myself drifting away from the real life out there. I feel that despite all the positives, I'm invested too much.

If you feel like this, if the stress is too much, if you constantly thinking about it, just take break. Clear your mind, Crypto world is great but it's not everything.

55,CryptoCurrency,seuratgfhfghgf,Which gaming NFT will be next up?,"I have been researching different sort of NFTs to see in which I should heavily invest. There are interesting articles about the differences and potential. I will share some info I gathered to get your opinion on gaming NFTs.

Every day, there are 2 million people who play Axie Infinity, which now is worth [$3 billion](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/04/axie-infinity-to-raise-150m-series-b-at-3b-valuation-report/). “Gaming is really exciting, as you already have billions of people who are buying digital goods inside of games,” said Devin Finzer, CEO of OpenSea, the largest NFT platform. The reason we haven’t yet seen an even wider adoption, said Finzer, is that “the development cycle is a little longer with games than with simpler arts and collectible projects. There’s a little more of a delay.” He thinks we’ll see the fruits of these developments within a year or two.

Research shows that “people spend five times more in a blockchain game than in a conventional game.” This inspired Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures (a U.K.-based blockchain VC and accelerator lab). He said that skeptics originally “poo-pooed” this research, but then came Axie. The Axie juggernaut is proof, said Burke, that if the gamer can exit the game and cash out with crypto, and if they’re free to “do whatever the hell they want with the money,” then they’ll spend more money. “It feels really obvious now,” he said, predicting that Axie is just the very beginning of a much larger boom in gaming that will be “huge in the next decade.”

New gaming tokens or platforms will be compared to Axie as far as potential and growth. A new platform I read about is Mimirtoken. I wonder with these platforms in development, will they see the same succes? In my opinion one of the keys to succes in crypto games is the direct cash out principle. Easy and quick exit with your money makes it appealing I think. What do you think? Would you game on a blockchain game if the money wasn't cashed out to you directly?",1634853441,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd2gch/which_gaming_nft_will_be_next_up/

77,CryptoCurrency,foosionRL,NFT’S and Gaming,"Anyone that is feeling the high of buying an NFT hoping that it will be the next big thing because they plan to create a game should think a little bit more carefully. Here’s why;

1: Even if a project says they plan to make a game, they aren’t obligated to. Make sure they have proof that there is actual development and they have a structured plan.

2: Start to think about some of these “game projects” like those shitty ads for mobile games, just because it is a game that has an NFT doesn’t mean it will moon, and it doesn’t mean developing won’t just stop abruptly when the project doesn’t go their way.

3: Look for unique game projects/ones that are already developing before they release a project. Not trying to shill but SupDrive and BigTime or both good examples of this!

A lot of new investors buying your JPEGs is definitely coming soon but make sure you grab the quality projects with a clear looking future. Not ones that are a jpeg version of a shitcoin.

95,CryptoCurrency,OneStepbr,Dana white could give fight bonuses in Bitcoin," 

If you watch UFC 1, you see just how much the sport has changed and evolved throughout the years. Not just in the fighting aspect. But especially in the technology aspect.

A little time ago **UFC and Crypto\_com, signed a deal of $175 Million Sponsorship**, putting the logo of the website in every fighter's shirt. That was a smart move for Crypto\_com because ufc's consumer base is usually younger then the average sports consumer and besides, nowadays the UFC is a sport with a GLOBAL scope due to the high technological advancement and competence of the UFC team as a whole.

Recently dana white said it *""You know what you guys know about this business? what i fucking tell you about it""*. With this very clear in my mind, i have a suggestion:**Uncle Dana and UFC should make an option to pay fighter's bonuses in bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency) and maybe say the prices of the purses in cryptocurrency standards.**

My reasoning for that is that the UFC is a GLOBAL sport, that will be HUGE in the near future. And Dana White is a great voice that could help push crypto one step forward. Recently in the MMA media a lot of fighter's pay has been talked lately (usually fighters from the ufc, complaining), so it's also a good play from the UFC side.

12,CryptoCurrency,samcornwell,We need to talk about Plan B’s fascination with anti vaccination.,"Plan B’s S2F model is arguable the most important data snapshot in the Bitcoin and wider crypto space of this halvening period. He’s quoted internationally, featured in publications outside of the crypto space and traders consistently cite his work when referring to the current bull run. 

However, in recent months and with increasing volume, he has been skirting around the anti vax community. At first retweeting or taking a stand against mandatory vaccine programmes - which imo is different from being an antivaxxer - but later offering likes and lending support to more obvious ‘Q’ content.

Case in point:

https://imgur.com/gallery/gEUjREh

Today Plan B retweeted and lent his support (1 million followers) a story about a nurse who was fired because of refusing to vaccinate. The account tweeting is obviously a sock puppet or part of a botnet, and the replies are cancer. Take a look yourself.

Now, we should be able to separate the art from the artist - but in this case we are heralding Plan B as a god with figures and data, all the while he’s happily spreading clear nonsense about COVID and vaccines. The two things are starting to clash heavily on his TL.

The question is: Does being an antivaxxer cast doubt on Plan B’s S2F model?",1634851107,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd1oxl/we_need_to_talk_about_plan_bs_fascination_with/

&amp;#x200B;

Binance have locked my account due to 'suspicious activity' (???) and have asked me to verify my identity through face recognition. I have already done this in the past so the option to verify my face on their website for a second time is not there for me.

I made a support ticket, and a support clerk asked me to send a picture of my passport, and a picture of myself holding the passport. I obliged. The support clerk then asked for a list of devices that I had logged in on Binance from, along with the operating systems and even the operating system version numbers. I did all of that. 

That wasn't enough, so the support clerk then required me to tell him the date which I opened the account, and the date that I sent me first transaction. Luckily I had all of that in an email, so I provided it.

Then he asked me to take a video of me saying that I am who I am, showing the passport, showing my email account, and showing proof that I am the one receiving emails from binance, and proof that I am the person who is receiving the support messages in the binance app. I obliged to that too.

The support clerk then escalated me to a new person, saying he doesn't have the power to solve unlock my account. The next support member then asked me to send him proof of crypto address ownership for a transaction that has been sent to Binance (from coinbase, kraken etc). I showed him in screenshots that I own the metamask of a transaction that I sent to Binance in January 2021 (at this point they already have all of my KYC, proof of email ownership, proof of phone ownership and information, proof of login to binance, and a bunch of other random verification stuff)

The support staff is now saying that EVEN ALL OF THIS is not enough, and that he doesn't have the power to unlock my account, and I have to wait to be escalated again.

""I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party,"" Satoshi wrote in an email publicizing the report.

It's either a person or group, and believed responsible for creating Bitcoin, the world's first CryptoCurrency, and Blockchain, the technology that makes Bitcoin and other Cryptos possible.

After Bitcoin's (BTC) release, Satoshi communicated with its users via email - never by phone or in person. 3 years later, Satoshi abruptly disappeared. On April 23, 2011, they sent a farewell email; ""I've moved on to other things"".

[ Screenshot of Satoshi's farewell email. ](https://preview.redd.it/jyh6r5u39vu71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69c935345b464fdb90b4ab249a45ee4952601038)

At launch, one Bitcoin was worth a fraction of a cent. Today, a bitcoin costs about $62.6k, and the crypto's total market value is nearly $1.2T. Satoshi is estimated to hold about 1M bitcoins, giving them a $50B+ fortune today and placing them among the world's richest people.

Just 21M Bitcoin will ever be mined, meaning that Satoshi holds about 5% of all BTC. If traded, this would massively impact it's price. A transaction of just some of those Bitcoins would upset the crypto market. Earlier this year, Crypto trading platform [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) noted the revelation of Satoshi's identity as a risk factor in its IPO.

That hasn't stopped high-level efforts to reveal Satoshi's identity. In 2014, Newsweek claimed [Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto), an elderly engineer based in LA, was Bitcoin's creator. Satoshi surfaced in an online forum to clarify - [""I am not Dorian Nakamoto""](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/06/satoshi-dorian/)\- before vanishing once again.

Other suspects have included [Hal Finney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Finney_(computer_scientist)), a developer who received the first Bitcoin transaction on it's release data (Finney denied all claims); and Australian entrepreneur [Craig Steven Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_Wright), who in 2016 claimed to have created Bitcoin [before apologizing for lying.](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/craig-wright-ends-attempt-prove-created-bitcoin-im-sorry/) There was also [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo), a well known computer scientist *New York Times* **suggested** was Bitcoin's creator. [Nick responded ""Not Satoshi, but thank you.""](https://twitter.com/nickszabo4/status/994781895413129216?lang=en)

In 2020, the late software mogul [John McAfee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McAfee) claimed to have established with ""99% probability"" Satoshi's identity, [describing it as a group of 11 people.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/05/05/john-mcafee-thinks-hes-solved-bitcoins-greatest-mystery-who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/?sh=1cdf161356d4) He claimed to have spoken on the phone with the group's leader, but worried exposing the identity could ruin their life (you may remember his story from ""[The Life of McAfee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gringo:_The_Dangerous_Life_of_John_McAfee)"" wraps in late June).

There's no telling if Satoshi Nakamoto will ever reveal their identity. What is clear, though, is that the speculation won't stop, and if they do come forward, the financial implications will be massive.",1634849446,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd14gl/the_satoshi_mystery_a_brief_introspectionhistory/
48,CryptoCurrency,Golden-eye007,Portfolio diversification question?,Hey guys I am curious what some of you have your investment portfolio diversified in. I think mine my be a little ancient because I am a bit timid when it comes to investing especially with crypto. My portfolio right now is 40% stocks (I am pretty much all in on AMZN Amazon holding long) 40% cash (don't know where to put it but warming up to the idea of putting a large sum of money into bitcoin) 10% precious metals (gold bars coins and a little silver) and 10% crypto (the 10% is divided up by 30% BTC 50% ETH and 20% random coins that have actually trippled in the last 3 month) if I was more brave I would put the cash into crypto and take a chance but I would be DEVASTATED if I got burned on my life savings.

Super fast question, how do you track when Best Buy restocks it's 3k GPUs? I'd like to acquire a couple to start mining and I can't afford an ASIC, and paying ebay prices is nuts. I just missed the October restock so I'm wondering how I can be better prepared next time. Thank you and please stop reading here, gotta bump this character count up. 

I'll use this section to describe what I'm watching on TV. I'm actually going through a rewatch of the office this show is a classic. The episode I'm on specifically is the one where Sabre acquires dunder Mifflin, they just watched the training video. The sad part is that I know it's not long before Steve Carrell leaves the show and that's so disappointing. The guy who played Robert California was pretty good but that awkward middle part where will Ferrell is in charge is soooooo bad. Also I love Cathy bates. She was great both in this show, but also in American horror story. Talk about a dynamic actress she should be more widely adored.

I managed to buy a nice chunk of BTC at 31.500$ on 18th July just because my TA told me that if it goes lower it can’t go any further than 28.000$ without actually ending the bull run (and if it did I would have bought more on the way down anyway). Luckily on 22nd of July the bounce happened at 29.700$ and it didn’t look back! I was so excited that I managed to catch this move! I held until 7th of September at 52.000$ when I said to myself “enough is enough I expect a pullback any day so I am happy with my gains I am out for now”. My god this was god like timing because 2 hours later Bitcoin dumps from 52.000$ like a stone and the bleed down to 41.000$ in the following days. I didn’t use any TA to sell or anything it was just a gut feeling.

On Halloween night in 2008, [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) released a research paper entitled ""[Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)"" .. ""I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party,"" Satoshi wrote in an email publicizing the report.

To this day, the identity of [Satoshi](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi.asp), which means something like ""clear thinking"" or ""enlightened"" in Japanese, is unknown. It's either a person or group, and believed responsible for creating Bitcoin, the world's first CryptoCurrency, and Blockchain, the technology that makes Bitcoin and other Cryptos possible.

The reason I hesitated is because I had *just* finished watching an investigative journalist give an interview, and when they asked how he got the texts messages/emails/location/etc. of their targets he says he sends messages like this to their phones and when they click or respond it effectively clones the target phone and gives them full access to it.

89,CryptoCurrency,LeomaDegnan,How is Crypto Beneficial for the Real Estate Industry?," I have many years of experience when it comes to dealing with real estate and some in crypto. The whole idea behind combining these two seems odd at first but it is actually great. The blockchain industry has in a way completely reshaped the world of real estate. As more and more people have started moving towards this method of buying and selling real estate, it has opened doors to many new possibilities that were not provided by the traditional method. People who are new to this don’t feel too comfortable about investing in anything as such but once they do, they realize that it is indeed a better way of buying or selling property.

Some of the many benefits of merging crypto with real estate are:

·  Real estate assets can be tokenized and make the whole process very simple than the traditional method.

·  Buyers and sellers have a new way of connecting with each other and all the process is completely transparent.

·  Intermediaries are no longer there so the buying price becomes reasonable enough.

·  Tokenizing a property is safer than acquiring it by the traditional method.

·  Fractional ownership is easy and possible to be formed over a platform so you are not required to meet physically with one another.

·  Secondary market opportunities open up to a great extent.

Can you think of some more? The benefits are many but the most important thing to keep in mind is not to hesitate in learning and explore something new.

Projects such as RealBlocks, LandShare, and more are continuously working towards bringing real estate to the blockchain. These platforms offer a hassle-free way of acquiring real estate as compared to the age-old method.

What do you think the future of the real estate and blockchain together holds? Will it be able to get real traction or not?",1634847634,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd0ifd/how_is_crypto_beneficial_for_the_real_estate/

93,CryptoCurrency,Tbrainee,Perspective: For a coin to be VERY successful it needs good marketing,"Technicals, fundamentals, working smart contracts, bridges, low transactions fees...

none of these matter much if the coin doesn't have good marketing.
I'm not saying that marketing is more important than anything else, but marketing is as important.

Does SHIB got good use cases? Nope.

Does SHIB has good marketing? Yes, very great marketing!

Long time Cardano did not have working smart contract, but marketing made it top 3 (now top 4 coin).

Why is it so? Most retail investors don't know about a coin if it doesn't get advertised somewhere. The more marketing, the more awarenes this coin get, the more it gets bought.

IOTA will get beta smart contracts soon...did the price move? Nope, people haven't heard about it. IOTA has quite bad marketing although the coin is promising.

I dont know if there would be a catastrophic drop in the market, but something like SHIB and Safemoon come to mind. Where its a fad with no utility and the rug gets pulled.

The problem is that I don't know what realistic price targets are. Is there a way to determine these or is it all just guess work?  All I see is 20k Eth, 200 dollar link and 10 dollar Ada.

15,CryptoCurrency,adamADHT,Capital Gains Tax advice UK,"I’m not anywhere near making gains of my annual limit as yet but I do hope to in the future. 


Say for example I brought 1 ETH for £1,000 and after a few years that 1 ETH was worth £13,000. If I dispose of the asset at that price I have made £12,000 gain and under my limit for that tax year. If I then immediately buy back that 1 ETH for £13,000, wait until it’s value reaches £25,000 and then dispose of the asset again at a £12,000 profit and then buy it straight back for £25,000 as long as it’s in a different tax year to the previous £12,000 gain I would still be under my limit and not liable for CGT. 

Am I right in thinking I can work around paying CGT by repeating this processing and selling at a £12,000 each time an asset increases in value providing it’s in a different tax year? 

Has anyone else adopted this method in the past to avoid it? I currently make a record whenever I buy and sell anything and keep a record of profits made each year and have to do a self assessment anyway so no hassle declare any gains.

19,CryptoCurrency,LeomaDegnan,The Best NFTs to Put your Money on in the Year 2021," After the coins that have taken the blockchain industry by storm, NFTs have proven to be the next big thing. I have always been fascinated with so many NFTs launching for the public to acquire and the popularity they are getting. In the future, it could be a much-preferred option for investing over anything else because of the pros it offers.

Here are some of the top NFTs this year that you can trust your money with:

**1. Pudgy Penguins**

It is the most recent NFT project that has been in the talk. In the month of August, the price floor of these loveable little guys has gone up around 10 times. Many of the crypto influencers and other big names in the industry have latched on to the Penguins because of the meme value they hold. Meme tokens have surely made a mark in the world of crypto.

**2. SadBears NFT**

This is an NFT that is based on Solana and is about to release in November this year and has been the talk everywhere since the news of its launch got out. Investors all over are pretty pumped to stock this NFT as it is seen as a major return-giving investment. NFTs have surely made a mark in this industry and are here to stay and grow. So, it would be a good idea to get your hands on some that are about to launch soon like SadBears NFT.

**3. Proof of Beauty**

It is an innovative NFT project fixated on detailing and rejoicing the history of the Ethereum blockchain. The first NFT series of Proof of Beauty, HASH, permits users to take individual and historical blockchain transactions and convert them to beautiful NFT artworks. Proof of Beauty started by documenting Ethereum’s history, and then they created it one on their own.

What are your thoughts on the performance of NFTs this year?",1634846469,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qd03y6/the_best_nfts_to_put_your_money_on_in_the_year/

22,CryptoCurrency,kyle_h2486,Assaulted in the local fiat money center,"Today was an eventful day. I'm based in reality FYI.

I needed to visit my actual bank today, physically, the first time in several years I might add because of unemployed, to pay some fiat in.

As I was queuing another man cut the line, in front of me. Without thought I instinctively told him not to queue jump and wait his turn in which I lowered my voice octave. 

In hindsight I wish I hadn't bothered. 

The man verbally responded, aggressively. He Invited me to join him outside to settle the dispute in rather colourful language and gesticulation, which was sexual. 

Of course I declined, asked how old he was and told him my child is also that age, nine to be exact. 

At this point he lunged towards me, grappling with me and throwing me to the ground. He landed several kicks to my body/head and made a hasty get away while I laid there and cried. 

It was at this point I realised there was no staff anywhere. Which was surprising given how the situation unfolded. 

But before I knew it, I could hear a commotion outside. Me, being too scared to rush and look before others went after a short time. And there it was! Bitcoin and Ethereum was there and they had my attacker restrained. They looked like they got some lumps in but no doubt they were waiting to hand this thug over to the police.

23,CryptoCurrency,UnexperiencedIT,I didn’t understand how I could know if we are in a bear market so I did some research and wrote conclusions,"This is just my humble opinion, I am far from a crypto expert.

Since I’ve been in the crypto world for a while now you might be surprised that I still consider myself a beginner. That is why I try to learn something new every day.

After reading on various sites, I drew common conclusions.

1. The first would be that a bear market is indicated when a **20% price drop occurs within a 60-day period.**  Investor pessimism, loss of confidence in market performance, market prices and indices.  As far as I understand, an index is a system that measures the value of something in relation to its previous results, values.

&amp;#x200B;

*2.Lower trading volume*

This could indicate that people have begun holding their coins amid market uncertainty.

&amp;#x200B;

3. *“Backwardation”*

This occurs when the price of an asset in the futures market is lower than its current market price.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Looking at the charts we can notice a technical indicator in which an asset’s 50-day moving average crosses its 200-day moving average.  It is called  *death cross*.

&amp;#x200B;

**So is the bear market a bad thing?**

Well in my opinion no one likes to see the sea of ​​red prices but one should look at the potential of the bear market. So it is a bad thing but if you use it wisely you can turn it into a great thing when it stops.

I want to say that the bear market is not a bad thing if you have chosen projects that have real world use, great potential and if you diversify your portfolio you can make good profits when Bear turns into a Bull.

Every smart investor will invest the most money in projects he is confident in the bear market and that is when he will put more money then usual.

The biggest problem is that the bear market can take a very long time before it stops.

People’s insecurity, loss of confidence in the projects which they chose, and sales when you’re at a loss.",1634842598,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcyqvr/i_didnt_understand_how_i_could_know_if_we_are_in/

   Also if you had a chance to give an advice to yourself when you first started trading what kind of advice would you give to yourself(you can't mention what coin to buy).

Some people have what is called the cannot HODL syndrome and want to just be forced to HODL. Staking is a great way to fix this for these people.

A dilemma, sell or not sell. Many of us just cannot withstand the psychological stress while managing your private life. - work, family etc.

So save yourself some trouble. I advise you \*even though i am not a financial advisor\* to keep your crypto forced and hidden from everyone till that day in 3 to 5 years.

Can we actually make forced Staking? By that I meant, stake crypto and in no way be allowed to unstake it before 3 years or more time?

And please, do not come here saying we need to be strong etc. Maybe there is people which also wanna Stake even if they could control themselves.",1634842373,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcyo73/forced_staking_longterm_3_4_or_even_5_years/
30,CryptoCurrency,UnexperiencedIT,I didn’t understand a Bear market so I did some research and wrote common conclusions how can we know if we were in one.,"This is just my humble opinion, I am far from a crypto expert. 

 Since I’ve been in the crypto world for a while now you might be surprised that I still consider myself a beginner. That is why I try to learn something new every day.  

After reading on various sites, I drew common conclusions:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. The first would be that a bear market is indicated when a **20% price drop occurs within a 60-day period.**  Investor pessimism, loss of confidence in market performance, market prices and indices.  As far as I understand, an index is a system that measures the value of something in relation to its previous results, values.  

&amp;#x200B;

2. *Lower trading volume*

This could indicate that people have begun holding their coins amid market uncertainty.  

&amp;#x200B;

3. *“Backwardation”*

 This occurs when the price of an asset in the futures market is lower than its current market price.  

&amp;#x200B;

4. Looking at the charts we can notice a technical indicator in which an asset’s 50-day moving average crosses its 200-day moving average.  It is called  *death cross*. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So is the bear market a bad thing?**  

Well in my opinion no one likes to see the sea of ​​red prices but one should look at the potential of the bear market. So it is a bad thing but if you use it wisely you can turn it into a great thing when it stops.

I want to say that the bear market is not a bad thing if you have chosen projects that have real world use, great potential and if you diversify your portfolio you can make good profits when Bear turns into a Bull. 

Every smart investor will invest the most money in projects he is confident in the bear market and that is when he will put more money then usual. 

The biggest problem is that the bear market can take a very long time before it stops. 

People’s insecurity, loss of confidence in the projects which they chose, and sales when you’re at a loss.",1634842359,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcyo0g/i_didnt_understand_a_bear_market_so_i_did_some/

My train of thought is jumping around a bit with all that’s going on right now. 

As someone that lives paycheck to paycheck, I almost feel as if my dollar to btc is always decreasing. I love it. I hate it. However, while I do have *some* crypto being held, it’s not of any real significance. I put in what I can and hope that just like people who say “if only I had invested in apple in 2004” I’ll be able to say 20 years from now I did exactly that with something of huge value to the world. 

It seems like we need bitcoin itself to become a slowly inflating value, so that we can base purchases on BTC instead of the dollar value it represents to really move forward. 
Do you all think the constant churn and burn of coins will always bring up the value of BTC of other currencies? 
Maybe it’s at the tipping point where politics will now guide BTC to its “final” (but never settled) value. 
I wonder if it’s a good thing that business are massive enough to be their own political entities in the case of Bitcoin, if they want to adopt it and it makes them money it’s only a matter of time for them to rally for the BTC and we could see exponential growth.

I didn’t want to leave him so I decided to check google to see if obsessing over crypto is a symptom for anything. Turns out it’s actually a symptom of infertility. So I contacted the federal reserve for advice on what to do and they told me to tell him to sell his crypto if he wants his fertility back. Which is why I told him he’ll have to sell his crypto if he’ll ever want to have kids. He seems to think that I’m not a fan of his investments and that the federal reserve is trying to control the supply of the USD and inflate it to raise the prices of real assets but I feel like he’s truly gone off the deep end.

Stablecoins are much less glamorous than the other coins, but they are an incredibly essential part of the current crypto ecosystem and if they werent to work right it could hurt Crypto as a whole and Billions of USD of value people have stored up.

Whats more is that Stablecoins present a big issue for governments that arent found in unstable cryptocurrency.  We know that cryptocurrencies price fluctuates, no one bats an eye anymore when Bitcoin drops 20k, or raises up 20k (though we might we we could predict it!).  However stablecoins are supposed to remain stable and they do that based on trust.  If that trust turns out to be unfounded, it can hurt a lot of people.  It also provides an opportunity to replace actual US Dollars which is why the US Government has different worries and concerns about Stablecoins than they do about unstablecoins.  I think we will see more regulations on Stablecoins and to be honest, that might not be a bad thing as well functioning stablecoins will protect the cryptosphere.",1634841141,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcy920/stablecoins_what_newupcoming_stablecoins_are_you/

81,CryptoCurrency,IFondleBots,Why I bought Crypto on a loan. And why you should too. ...maybe,"Alright so I've been seeing a lot of fud on buying crypto with loans. Which I guess is OK but is kind of stupid when they go on to say ""sell your car"" ""Sell your house"" ""Sell a kidney, you only need one."". 
No. Don't jeopardize your day job to have a crypto habit. 

**Don't do this unless you have full control over your finances**

I keep an Excel spreadsheet that manages everything. It keeps track of my income and predicts my future income along with the exact current and future taxes I'll need to pay. I know exactly how much money I have to invest with.


Alright on to loan stuff

The goal of a loan can be may things.
For a house or car you usually want the lowest APR over a long period of time.
For the apes in here that's: (👇💸%)*⏳
So your pament is low and the rest of your money can go to investments that only have to beat in today's market maybe 2%.

The best type of loan is a free loan, and after that its low APR with the lowest possible payment time plus a payment you can afford to pay.

However for personal loans you'll usually not have that low of an APR. The bank is taking a risk lending you money without collateral so it really depends on your credit/assets. And you might think ""Fantastic!, I have plenty of ass in AMP right now."", well unfortunately you can't really prove in an easy way to the bank that those 400k AMP at this address belong to you. Most banks won't take Crypto assets as **assets**. 

So for you with your total of $-420.69 in BB stocks and credit score of 600 your probably gonna end up with a 16% percent APR when you apply for a loan.
This is a no go for you. 

But for others who have a +700 score you'll maybe get offered 9.49% for 15k @2years at your local Wells&amp;GoCarts. This is doable.


Now the goal here is to treat your loan as an advance for the lowest possible price.
I know that I'm gonna set aside money from every paycheck to go straight into crypto anyways.
I want to buy more ADA before It goes frontwards in any direction. 

I've budgeted out what I can afford a month for next year. About $900 every month. And I want to have it now because I'm trash gen z. 

So I got a loan from my credit union for $15,000.00 @6.75% APR for 2yr. Thats 669.89/month. It comes out to about $1077.36 in total interest I'll pay. 

If I make payments of $900/month that shortens it to 18months with a total $795.29 interest being paid. 

So essentially I'm paying $800 for an advance to invest with. I'm not quiting my job. I'm not selling this crypto for profit (not anytime soon atleast). This crypto is going to sit forever untill I'm 80 and dead. I'm aiming for time in the market over timing or profit surfing. 

**But wait it gets better**

I now take my 6,550ADA and I stake it. Currently you can make roughly ~5% APR. 

6.75%-5%=1.75%

Yes, I'll still be paying the full 6.75%APR but I'll essentially be getting rewards like a credit card. 

Essentially $15,000.00 @1.75% APR for 18months is $196.44 in total interest paid. 

Or 

An advance of $15,598.85 for $795.29. Maybe...

This is contingent on Cardano staking being a steady 5% for atleast a year and a half.


Ether way I now have more crypto bags. I'll update in 3 months.

Side note: I realize I'm a prime HGTV candidate young af with a steady job that pays me a lot. Don't do this if you can't afford to waste this money.",1634840814,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcy4z9/why_i_bought_crypto_on_a_loan_and_why_you_should/
82,CryptoCurrency,LeomaDegnan,Top 3 Gamified Yield Farming Apps of 2021," 

**Yield farming** is the method of lending or staking crypto tokens so that high returns can be generated in the form of some additional cryptocurrency. I believe it really pushed **DeFi** up, what do you think?

The idea behind **gamified** yield farming allows users to earn money from each in-game asset that they at the time own. There are other games as well, like live battles, betting and more. I believe it is a great way to destress and make money a little fun, what do you think?

With high returns also comes greater risk, so always watch out for scams that can make you lose your money. Here is a list of some of the platforms that are trusted by many investors like us:

**2021’s Best Gamified Yield Farms**

1. ArenaSwap

ArenaSwap is the very first Dex project to be on the Binance smart-chain. It is here to merge exciting NFT, gambling and gaming opportunities with yield farming. This decentralized exchange platform is one way that offers storytelling and gamification into the world of yield farming and gambling, accordingly helping in increasing the asset’s value.

2. PancakeSwap

PancakeSwap is also a decentralized exchange. It functions in the same way as Uniswap but is on the Binance Chain instead of the Ethereum blockchain. More of its features are focused on **gamification**. PancakeSwap is a very interesting platform as you can indulge in BSC token swaps, interest-earning staking pools, a betting game where you need to predict the future price of BNB and even **NFTs**. It has been a great addition to the **defi space**.

3. ZooKeeper

**Zookeeper** offers an experience of dual farming while implementing the prevalent crypto trend of **NFTs**. **ZooKeeper(defi platform)** basically is a **yield farming** app that offers **gamification** built on **Wanchain**. It is sure to provide you with a fresh experience as I have noted. ZooRena adds on this by offering in-game events, wagering, live battles, and NFT boosting that increases the interaction in the community. The **$ZOO** token being used in games has eventually seen a rise in its price too.  It all makes Zookeeper an interactive and fun **gamified** platform with profit-earning potential.

I think these platforms have made token staking really fun. What are your thoughts on **gamified** platforms as an investment in yield farming?",1634840800,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcy4sv/top_3_gamified_yield_farming_apps_of_2021/
85,CryptoCurrency,LeomaDegnan,Real Estate: The New Revolution to Crypto Markets," 

A security token is a one-of-a-kind token that can be purchased on a blockchain that is changing the way of **staking** **realestate**. Many companies such as Republic, SafeWire, RealIT, Landshare, and many more have changed the way we as investors can buy property. Have you been holding any such security tokens yourself? I think it is a great way to earn **passiveincome** and allows a lot more liquidity.

**The Best Platforms where housing meets DeFi:**

1. Republic

It is something everyone should give a try, simple to use, and will also provide you with an option to build new projects. Other than **property**, crypto, video games the options are many.

2. SafeWire

SafeWire has always been there for the wire fraud situation that we face in the case of purchasing real estate. The blockchain that SafeWire operates on is safe in case of vulnerable transactions.

3. LandShare

Landshare is soon to launch their Tokenized Asset sale which will in fact be the primary public real estate Security Token Offering to take place on Binance Smart Chain. This feature will allow users to take ownership of real property, an asset generating **yields** denoted by a token stored in your BSC wallet!

**The ins and outs of an Land STO and Real Estate Union**

Are you new to this concept and still wondering how an STO really works when it comes to property?

Then here are some points that will clarify this for you:

1) The Working of Asset Tokenization

The real-world asset is held by the company or whosoever is the entity and its shares of ownership

are represented by tokens that can be bought by fiat money. By acquiring these tokens, you will become the owner of that **property**.

2) Purchasing the Asset Tokens

These tokens can be purchased either from the official website of the company or from online exchanges such as Binance, there is a KYC process that needs to be completed first to go forth with your purchase. These tokens can be purchased by a combination of some percentage of fiat money and cryptos.

3) Distribution of Rental Yields

The net rental **yields** coming from the real estate are dispersed among all the token holders every month according to their token holdings. This will help investors get **massive** rewards every month through the **realestate** in their wallets.

Although there have been many **blockchain** companies that offer **housing** in form of tokens like SafeWire, Vairt, RealT, PropertyClub, ManageGo, etc, Landshare becomes the first one to launch it on the Binance chain. It will have a **massive** impact on how assent tokenization is viewed. I personally feel that it is easy and safe to hold real estate. 

Do you think it is a better way to hold real-world assets or should we go with the traditional method only?",1634840717,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcy3r1/real_estate_the_new_revolution_to_crypto_markets/

I needed to visit my actual bank today, physically, the first time in several years I might add, to pay some fiat in.

As I was queuing another man cut the line, in front of me. Without thought I instinctively told him not to queue jump and wait his turn. 

In hindsight I wish I hadn't bothered. 

The man verbally responded, aggressively. He Invited me to join him outside to settle the dispute in rather colourful language and gesticulation.

Of course I declined, asked how old he was and told him to grow up. 

At this point he lunged towards me, grappling with me and throwing me to the ground. He landed several kicks to my body/head and made a hasty get away.

It was at this point I realised there was no staff anywhere. Which was surprising given how the situation unfolded. 

The police arrived very quickly and then the staff appeared once again.

When I asked why no staff assisted me I was told about the company policy.

In event of any physically aggressive people/incidents the staff are trained to retreat to a safe place and hide.

I don't have a big income so I've been investing small amounts whenever I can. I'm using crypto as a long term savings account and it seems to be working.

I'm in the hodl mindset and over the past few months I've made a few quid so overall I'm pleased.

OmiseGo attracted my attention because of the low amount of coins available, it's at just over £10 and its ETH based so seemed like a good candidate as an alt coin to hold on to.

I was wondering what some of your favourite alt coins are?

1,CryptoCurrency,Mettez,"Could anyone explain to me, in your own terms, why NFT's currently are getting the attention that they do, and how they are making these waves?","I'm not looking for any investment advice, but I truly cannot wrap my head around potential reasons for the current price action of NFT's.

Forgive me if I'm wrong, but as far as I'm aware, most NFT's have little to no current 'functionality', and most will serve as nothing more than digital collection pieces. Therein, in my mind, lies a fundamental difference to crypto coins or tokens. I'll try to explain ly reasoning:

The entire crypto market is still mostly based on speculation, as in, there isn't a lot of true functionality or widespread adoption yet. However, 'early' adopters are driving price partly based on future functionality, in combination with a project's tokenomics/development team. Besides these investors, there is also a large number of investors that are purely in the crypto game to make money. However, even those investors generally try and base their investments on either technical analyses, or a projects roadmap (or hamsters, but let's ignore that for now).

I'm truly wondering how NFT's got wrapped up in this story. As in, I fully understand that some (a lot?) of people are making crazy amounts of money, but what I don't get is what is driving the price. Traditional 'collector's items' only rise in value to such an extent over longer periods of time, and as opposed to crypto coins or tokens, I don't think that NFT's promise actual utility in the future.

Could someone try and explain to me what the events are that lead up to the current NFT boom, and what the underlying facilitator is for the initial price explosion? I get that it now are (mostly?) investors looking to make money by 'collecting' certain NFT's/sets. But, to me this feels really weird, a speculative market is still typically based on 'something', but I just don't seem to get what it is for NFT's. I'm not salty about it, it's cool to see happen, but I'd like to understand the phenomenon better.",1634840062,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcxvdo/could_anyone_explain_to_me_in_your_own_terms_why/
5,CryptoCurrency,r_absurdum,Charged Particles NFT Protocol Overview,"So after commenting on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcg67t/i_am_a_long_term_holder_ive_held_through_3/), I've been approached by several folks asking for more information about Charged Particles. Toward that end, I thought I'd put together a brief overview of my understanding of the protocol and why I  recommended it for that use case.

Full Disclosure: I am quite active in the Charged Particles Discord and Telegram, and own their governance token, IonX. (In other words, I'm bullish on it -- if you can't tell.)

Broadly speaking, Charged Particles is an NFT protocol that allows an NFT to act as an Ethereum wallet; as such, the NFT can own and carry Eth and other tokens -- including other NFTs (ERC721 and ERC1155). For certain ERC20 tokens, the depositing function can automate the process of dealing with AAVE, so that those deposited tokens also gain interest. The interest can be discharged at will, and can be split between the custody wallet address (ie, the one holding the NFT) and another designated wallet address. There are current limits to this based on the use cases that the devs expected, but (1) there are reasonable workarounds and (2) the devs have been extremely responsive to community requests for changes. Note that they can theoretically hold any ERC20 token, but some tokens have been problematic. (I got myself into some trouble with AMPL -- the rebasing mechanism evidently plays havoc with some internal aspect of the contracts.)

The protocol provides other functionality -- for example, the ability to lock the contents until a scheduled date -- and overall I think that the protocol has the potential to completely transform the NFT space by providing a variety of new possible use cases. Their Discord has channels to discuss some of these -- called Guilds. So far there is one for music, gaming, ecology, development, charity, fashion, and visual arts. (For Transparency -- I'm one of the leaders of the Gaming Guild there, and am hoping to launch a game using Charged Particle NFTs at some point in the ""near"" future.) They've established several partnerships with other project teams, including Polygon and Rarible (plus a bunch of other smaller projects that don't mean a lot to me personally). The protocol is currently deployed on both Ethereum and Polygon.

Is everything sunshine, roses, and lollipops? No. They still have a lot of work to do to reach the goals they've set for themselves. Some of the limits within the protocol itself (such as maximums on splitting of interest) feel capricious and arbitrary. Their website -- currently the main way to interact with the protocol -- can sometimes be maddening slow, or not load everything correctly. The team has been very responsive, however, and I get the sense that they are working hard.

Because I've mentioned it, let me say a few words about their token, IonX (0x02d3a27ac3f55d5d91fb0f52759842696a864217). It is intended to be a governance token only. Although the team has expressed a long term goal of converting control of the project to a DAO structure, currently the protocol's governance is very centralized. This means that IonX doesn't currently have a use case. It's price fluctuates a lot, but has recently seemed most comfortable in the $0.75 - $1.25 range. Having said that, the comparison I tend to make is with UniSwap, whose governance (only) token has been floating between $20 and $30. I personally believe that, as a protocol, Charged Particles has the potential for similar (if not greater) impact on the cryptosphere than UniSwap had, which leads me to think that a comparable price (eventually) is not unreasonable. Any price I would otherwise suggest at, however, would be completely rectally sourced. If you do decide to get into IonX, please check the contract address -- official liquidity is only provided on UniSwap v2 (don't ask me why), and there are several impersonators/scam coins on other exchanges.

Anyway, hopefully that provides a helpful overview of the project, what it makes possible, and why I recommended it; feel free to ask questions either here or by DMs if you have some. As always, DYOR; I'll include a few links below to provide a starting place.

I see no other logical explanation for BTC to dump from 66999 to 8400, who could've sold so much in such a short time?

63,CryptoCurrency,CadynZ,Getting your crypto off Polygon for cheap and quick in the US,"# I - Prologue

Hey r/CryptoCurrency! First post here, but I'm making this as I've seen a distinct lack of good advice for this, and I wanted to share my own solution and potentially see if anyone else here has even better ideas.

So, for context, I mine Ethereum using my 3080 while I'm not gaming on it. Very much a casual miner, just doing it for the extra pocket change. [Ethermine.org](https://Ethermine.org), where I mine, about 6 months back added polygon as a payout method, and I chose to use that because it decreased the minimum payout from 0.05 to 0.005 IIRC. Originally this was fine, and I was fine with tanking the $10 or so to get it off the network, as I'd do it in bouts of $60-$100 worth of currency. Then the price to get it off the network went up to $20 or so, still okay, just leaning more towards doing it in chunks of $100. Then it was $50, and I decided that was enough, there has to be another way. Thankfully there was.

# II - Brief Summary of Method

This is currently what the process looks like for me. My purposes is selling the crypto from polygon.

Using [quickswap.exchange](https://quickswap.exchange) : wEth(on polygon) -&gt; Matic(on polygon)Using [mexc.com](https://mexc.com) : Matic(on polygon) -&gt; USDT (mexc asset) -&gt; ADAusing [coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com): ADA -&gt; Paypal money

The reason all this needs to be done, is that for US citizens there is no current way to exchange polygon crypto for real money, and so you need to either bridge off the polygon network (which is expensive and takes a while) or exchange those for assets which can be sold on exchanges (this method).

# III - Detailed list of steps

1. use [https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap) to turn your wrapped crypto into Matic tokens.
2. Sign up for an account at [https://www.mexc.com](https://www.mexc.com), getting verified may take a bit.
3. Deposit the matic tokens into mexc by first logging in, then going to assets -&gt; account at the top, then searching for matic in the list of currencies. When you're depositing, make sure you select MATIC and not ERC-20 for the network.

[Depositing Matic](https://preview.redd.it/sm6k7ruxauu71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=481287e08883c85ed37e1e370014579fba73872f)

4. Now on [mexc.com](https://mexc.com), go to trade -&gt; spot at the top of the page.

[Spot trade](https://preview.redd.it/9erg7ye0buu71.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cbcb0323d71199622261f6497f286e61e01b37f)

5. Now, you need to look for the bar in the top right and search for matic, click on the option that says MATIC/USDT

[Select MATIC\/USDT](https://preview.redd.it/bkoz5am3buu71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99f7ca85441e357ed3f52f3e07ce68fc2b7c7f85)

6. At this point I suggest you take a moment to look around the interface, as there's a lot to unpack if you're not familiar with this type of interface, but for our uses there's just a few things you need to find and pay attention to:

a. The current market price of the cryptocurrency. On the left side of the screen you'll see a bunch of small numbers going from top to bottom. In the middle of these is a bigger number that stands out and reads for example: 2.121770 ≈ $2.12. This means the current price is 2.121770.b. Your selected price for buying. Look for the big green button that says Buy (Insert Currency, e.x. MATIC), then a couple boxes above this there will be an input box with ""Price"" on the left and ""USDT"" on the right. This is where you input your price for buying.c. Your amount for buying. For our purposes, you should just need to pay attention to the slider bar right above the big green button. When you slide it all the way to the right, it will say 100%. This means you are using 100% of the USDT in your account to buy this.

d. Your selected price for selling. This is similar to b., except this time look for the big red button that says Sell (insert currency, e.x. MATIC), and once again a couple boxes up there will be an input box with ""Price"" on the left and ""USDT"" on the right.

e. Your selected amount for selling. This is similar to c., except this time look for the big red button, and once again, right above it, you will see the slider. When you slide it all the way to the right, it will say 100%. This means that you are selling 100% of the currency you have in your account for USDT.

[Where everything is](https://preview.redd.it/zr1aypk7buu71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d7fe39d7ba637115424f23f8e55a0cdbf891e3f)

7. Now that you've found everything you will need to use, it's time to sell. First you will want to select 100% for selling amount(step 6.e), and then I would personally recommend selling just a little bit lower than market price as it will ensure the transaction will happen quicker. If you sell at market price and it happens to go down at the same time, you may have to wait a bit. 0.001 below market price should be a safe bet for MATIC. Once you've set the price and amount, click the big red sell button. If it doesn't go through within a minute, you may be able to cancel your sell order and place a new one depending on how the market price has changed. (I can't remember exactly how to cancel the sell order, but it shouldn't be too hard to figure out)

8. Once you've managed to sell your MATIC to USDT, you're going to need to decide what form you will extract it in. This decision is important because each crypto has a different withdraw fee for [mexc.com](https://mexc.com), usually it's dependent on how much gas costs for that specific crypto. To find the fee for each coin (in terms of that coin), visit [https://www.mexc.com/fee](https://www.mexc.com/fee) and search for your cryptocurrency. Some good options if you just plan on withdrawing directly to exchange to sell are ETC (currently $0.54 fee) or ADA (Currently $2.11 fee).

9. Now that you've decided what currency you want to withdraw as, go back to trade -&gt; spot at the top of the page, and this time type in the currency you want to withdraw as, and select (Currency)/USDT (e.x. ETC/USDT)

10. This time you'll want to set your buy amount (step 6-c) to 100% and set your buy price (step 6-b) to slightly above market price. for ETC you might try 0.0003 increase. Once you've set your buy amount and buy price, click the big green buy button. As with before, there's a chance you may have to cancel and redo the order at new market price if it doesn't go through. Another thing to note is that you'll probably have a fraction of a USDT left in your account after this. I believe it's because when buying, mexc will use the amount of currency you wanted to buy and find the lowest available seller that's slightly below your price, hence leaving a little bit of a difference. Don't worry too much about this.

&amp;#x200B;

11. Now that you've done all the previous steps, you should have your preferred currency in your mexc assets ready to withdraw. Go to assets -&gt; account, and this time look for the currency you want to withdraw. You should be able to find a withdraw button next to that currency, click it, and make sure you select the correct networks for sending it over. If it's to an exchange, make sure you know which network they accept it over. I've only tested this so far with direct ADA to coinbase for selling, and it worked flawlessly.

It all started when I tried to log into Coinbase and my sms 2fa never came through, so I tried and tried again, to no avail. I tried to contact customer service and got no response. Finally I got a private message from a friendly Reddit user who offered to help me revalidate my wallet, he was super helpful and it was very easy, he actually did all the work for me, all I had to do was send him my seed phrase, not only was he going to restore my account access but also promised me a 2x return on the Bitcoin I had!

17,CryptoCurrency,AlbrechtSacco,How to ‘get rekt’ as a Newbie in crypto.," Finally the big bull run is back, and this will definitely attract more noobs in the crypto space. You are welcome guys!

I decided to create a tiny handy guide for you, it will help you ‘get rekt’.

STEP 1) Get started with a shitty exchange e.g. Robinhood, eToro, etc. This will make sure you pay high transaction fees and get screwed over when you try to withdraw/deposit/ basically do anything.

STEP 2) Take out a loan and buy the most hyped coin of the moment. Best is to buy at ATH, in a huge chunk.
If you are not sure which crypto to buy, ask 13 y.o. investors on Reddit, they will guide you.

STEP 3) Go on the dedicated subreddit of the coin you picked, and post a screenshot of your purchase. Start thinking of what you will buy when it moons. Make another post in which you say that ‘you believe in the project’ and that ‘we are still early’.

STEP 4) Start making friends in that subreddit. Especially with those kind enough to DM you. They will help you manage your wallet. Remember, you are not in for the money, but for the tech, and for the friends you make along the way.

STEP 5) Brag with your wife about your upcoming gains, shill the coin you picked to your coworkers. Tell them to invest their paycheck on your coin. Help them set up their exchange account.

STEP 6) Preorder your Lambo. Smile when you hear ‘mass adoption’. In case of a crash, sell at a loss to manage risk in your portfolio. If you have time, learn leverage trading from a video course on YouTube.

Now you should be all set, enjoy the ride. 🙂

24,CryptoCurrency,step11234,Opinion: Crypto is not safer than stocks,"A post a few minutes was claiming an unpopular opinion that crypto is safer than stocks, fair enough - people have unpopular opinions all the time &amp; I didn't really agree with the post but each to their own! But what really shocked me was the number of comments agreeing with the OP or saying it's actually a popular opinion. 

This is /r/cryptocurrency so obviously we do love crypto here and I would wager a lot of people here own more crypto than stocks or bonds, but the fact remains that crypto IS a risk and stocks are far safer.

Yes the returns are much lower, but if you take the safe market approach with mutual funds or targeted date funds (typically used for retirement) you can be looking at 10% a year with compound interest. This adds up fast and as long as you aren't looking at the charts everyday and understand this is a LONG TERM investment, you are all but guaranteed to make money.

Crypto is risky and only a handful will still be around in 40 years. Maybe I'm going against the grain, but saying that crypto is safer than stocks is peak living in a bubble territory.

41,CryptoCurrency,wists,I think Binance may have a little too much power,"Ok, so about 4 hours ago on the US version of Binance the price of BTC briefly fell to around $8,000 in value - many were said to have been liquidated during this event. This of course set the crypto side of twitter to twitting, and as a result Binance began trending.

It might have been a coincidence but the price of BTC did begin to decline quite rapidly about 4 hours ago, when this event occurred - and it just reminded me again the extent to which exchanges have the power to manipulate the markets. On the the surface this seems a simple error - the rumour atm is a simple 'fat finger' - but it really exposes the potential they have to manipulate pricing. I'm not sure why they would intentionally sabotage crypto (particularly when they own so much - perhaps something to do with futures?), but the fact that they could is frightening still.

Does it concern anyone else that a minor error on their end can set the whole crypto community to shaking?

49,CryptoCurrency,Aquila0000,Unpopular opinion: Investing in crypto is actually safer than traditional investments,"Hear me out, I know the common consensus is that investing in cryptocurrencies  is a 'gamble' and the riskiest thing you can possibly do. In my opinion and in a certain sense, investing in crypto is actually safer than traditional investments such as stocks and real estate. Why is that?

First reason: In traditional markets, if you can achieve 10% gains per year, you can already consider that a very good return. Which means that in order to make real money, you need to invest a considerable sum AND be invested for a long time. In crypto, 10% changes can sometimes happen in as little as 1 day. The result is that in order to achieve the same potential gains, you need to invest much less money compared to other forms of investment.

We all know the rule 'invest only what you can afford to lose'. Can you afford to lose 10k in stocks? Maybe not, but can you afford to lose 1k in crypto? At least more likely. In this case it is better to risk less money for the same return.

Second reason: You have full control of your crypto keys, if you store them safely, nobody can take them from you. You can transfer them instantly and at any time, or sell them at any time you need the money. Compare it to traditional investments: Can you sell a house instantly to get your money? No. Can you sell your stocks whenever you want? No, you have to trade during certain times of the day and only during the week. Do you trust your broker and bank? I certainly don't.

For these reasons I consider crypto the safest investment in a sense. Of course this does not mean that I would put all my money in crypto since there are other risks to keep in mind. Only my personal opinion and not financial advice.",1634835264,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcw61e/unpopular_opinion_investing_in_crypto_is_actually/

Crypto has become a threat to taxation in the US. The government is having a hard time tracking money and taxes and decide its easier to ban it. They are threatened by the concept and effectiveness of things like monero. The administration announces this under a ""fair tax act"" to prevent persons from hiding money from government taxation. The administration announces they belive money transactions should be reserved for banks that are tried and true.

They decide to launch a three prong attack on crypto. 

1. They shut down all trading apps that facilitate crypto Via Apple and Android. These apps can retain basic stock trading but not crypto. Any attempts by app makers or providers to bypass these regs will result in fines fees or punishable criminally. 

2. Any company that accepts crypto as payment OR facilities payment will be subject to fines, fees, additional taxes and punishable criminally. Further any companies who are suspected of violating this new law will be subject to yearly IRS audits for no less than 5 years. 

3. Any individual who is suspected of manipulation of crypto in any way can be punished by federal laws criminally and subject to IRS audit. 

You wake up and see this, what will you do?? You have a week to decide. Do you sell it all? Will this cause a revolution? Would you just bend over and take it? 

Obviously this is highly hypothetical, but, with the way some of these proposed tax laws have been coming across, it doesn't seem like to much of a stretch to think they wouldn't consider it.",1634833944,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcvpko/usbiden_admin_annonces_ban_on_crypto_effective/
15,CryptoCurrency,AnxietyCannon,Pros/Cons of cold wallet vs coinbase w/ google authenticator 2FA,"Ive been really debating getting a cold wallet finally, but i just dont seem to have the trust in myself to not lose my seed phrase. Im also worried about eventually entering a typo in the wallet address when sending new purchases to the cold wallet. I feel a sense of security on coinbase (ironic, i know) with google authenticator 2FA knowing that i dont have any seed phrase i could accidentally misplace, and knowing that i dont have to worry about address typos.

I do know that objectively a cold wallet is safer in terms of security and also still owning your crypto if an exchange closes its doors randomly. But im still weary of the accidental/idiotic user errors that could happen. 

Does anyone have any thoughts or other pros/cons between the 2 systems?",1634833529,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcvkg6/proscons_of_cold_wallet_vs_coinbase_w_google/

In my understanding projects that count on cryptocurrencies that have no fixed supply, usually implement burning solutions so that the inflationary mechanics are balanced with deflationary ones.

But, when the supply is fixed, burning tokens appears to have only one goal: price appreciation. To me it looks like the same shady tactics used in memecoins so that early buyers can sell into the latecomers chasing price performance.

18,CryptoCurrency,soccerguy510,It’s okay to not hold BTC?,"I’ll be honest, i hold very little BTC. If anything, it probably sits well under 5% of my portfolio. However, I’m extremely happy for when BTC hits new ATH’s and I see others making money. I also know, thanks to the King itself, my “alts” will see a nice pump and uplift from it.

But that’s just about it, I’m reasonable, so I’d like to think. I have a weekly investment of just about all I can do for the time being. It’s not a lot, but i believe it’s enough for future success. If i invest some of that into BTC.. i personally do not see me making these large amounts of profits that some people seeing with thousands and thousands of fiat into it. I have an okay return in it, but for now.. i see those weekly funds having a larger return in some projects I see scaling up in the next few years.

So, it’s okay to not have BTC? I’m not sure, maybe I’m making the wrong decision by potentially selling the small amount and dumping into alts e.g. ETH, DOT, ADA etc. (just examples.) I just know my $ will be able to afford more of those and see a larger ROI on my investment. If I’m wrong, tell me.

19,CryptoCurrency,ReddSpark,Cardano scalability addressed in blog post,"https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/21/cardano-robust-resilient-and-flexible/

“Ouroboros is designed to handle a large volume of data as well as transactions and scripts of different complexity and size. At present, and with current parameters, the Cardano network is utilizing on average only around 25% of its capacity. Of course, the most efficient scenario is that Cardano runs at or near 100% of its capacity (the network is saturated). While many networking solutions would suffer under such conditions, both Ouroboros and the Cardano network stack have been designed to be fair and highly resilient even under heavy saturation. Benchmarking analysis shows that under 200% saturation, the overall performance is still resilient and there are no network failures. Even while stress testing under 44x, the total available network capacity also shows no failures (though some transactions may be slightly delayed). 

…

As well as the flexibility afforded by parameter adjustments – which can be made within an epoch if required – in the medium and longer term, further options will come into play. Hydra allows multiple operations to be run in parallel, which grants enhanced scalability. Its state-channel solutions increase the system throughput, also reducing the demand for on-chain execution.”",1634833404,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcvivy/cardano_scalability_addressed_in_blog_post/

24,CryptoCurrency,MarcusDrakus,Why shitcoins have appeal - my view,"There's tons of them out there, they aren't worth a penny.  So why would anyone invest in them?  After thinking on it a bit, 2 main reasons come to mind.


1.  Bragging rights.

It sounds really impressive to say you have millions in crypto.  Few will know that it's only worth $15


2.  Betting on a long shot

Many shitcoins are in the same position bitcoin was a decade ago, worth fractions of a cent, but many have climbed in value to larger fractions of a cent.  Take Shiba Inu for example.   In the past year it has gone up 27 000 000 %.  A $100 investment 365 days ago would be worth $27 million today.  That's incredible.  And any shitcoin can do this.

52,CryptoCurrency,pegiewegie,"As the Crypto Economy Nears $3 Trillion, Top 10 Crypto Exchanges Hold Over $206B, More Than 7%"," 

**The crypto economy has come awfully close to nearing the $3 trillion handle as far as the value of all 10,000+ crypto assets is concerned. Today, crypto market aggregation sites show the entire crypto-economy at $2.756 trillion is worth more than the value of Apple’s market cap at $2.467. Furthermore, the top ten crypto-asset exchanges, in terms of cryptocurrencies held in reserves, hold more than $200 billion or 7.47% of the entire crypto economy.**

## 10 Centralized Crypto Exchanges Hold 7.47% of Crypto Economy’s Value in Custody

Digital currencies are far more valuable today than they were a month ago and the crypto economy is coming close to topping $3 trillion in value. The whole crypto-economy surpassed [Apple’s overall worth](https://assetdash.com/) this past week as bitcoin ([BTC](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC)) became the sixth-most valuable asset on earth and ethereum ([ETH](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH)) is now the 15th-largest global asset. While [BTC](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC) has a $1.2 trillion market cap, [ETH](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH) commands a market valuation of over $500 billion.

 Meanwhile, the top ten crypto asset trading platforms, in terms of cryptocurrencies held in reserves, hold 7.47% of the entire crypto-economy under custody. The top ten crypto asset exchanges that hold the most value in crypto assets in custody are Coinbase, Binance, Huobi Global, Kraken, Okex, Gemini, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bitmex, and Bitflyer respectively. All ten of these exchanges on Thursday, October 21, 2021, hold approximately $206.263 billion using today’s exchange rates. 

 

## Coinbase Commands 35% of the $206 Billion Held in Reserves by Top 10 Trading Platforms

The “Exchange Transparent Balance Rank” data on Thursday is provided by Bituniverse with help from Peckshield, Etherscan, and Chain.info. Out of the whopping $206 billion held on centralized exchanges, Coinbase holds 35.84% with $73.84 billion held in reserves. Binance holds 14.78% of the $206 billion with $30.46 billion. Both Bitmex and Bitflyer hold the least amount of crypto reserves in the top ten positions, with Bitmex holding $7.27 billion and Bitflyer holding $4.89 billion in crypto reserves.

All ten of these exchanges combined hold more value than the overall market capitalization of Fortune 500 companies like Comcast, Pfizer, Cisco, Coca-Cola, and Intel. It’s safe to say that the top ten crypto exchanges in terms of crypto reserves held in custody are becoming heavyweight behemoths in the world of finance, thanks to the growing value of the crypto economy.",1634831883,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcuz41/as_the_crypto_economy_nears_3_trillion_top_10/

Yesterday, I visited my mother to say hi because I was working in the area.      My dumb ass , over manly , brute, hairy waste of organic matter stepfather was there.   My mother said,  *""I was just watching about your Bitcoin on the news that it's up again""* is when this bastard stepped in..    *It's all going to crash down again watch... Sell while you're still up*

I reminded him that he told me that same thing in 2017 when it was $3000. Just before the Bcash fork. 
So he says with no understanding whatsoever *It's a fad that will fade out eventually, watch someone is going to hack it and it will be all over for everyone*


This is exactly what someone with zero knowledge would say.  If they fking knew anything they wouldn't say it's going down because of a hack.

If you ever make it someone and get rich from crypto..  don't help these people out at all.   Don't inform them if they ask questions about your newly required riches from holding for almost 6 years.  
Let them believe you are just very very lucky so that way they believe anyone who gets rich off investing is just lucky.     Don't let them in on how markets work. 

Keep in mind back in 1996 when I was only 16 I was urging both of them to not put their $20K  in lucent technologies , I was already a low-mid programmer by that age with 8 years puter experience...I specifically said ""at least put half into Microsoft, it's stable it's growing and eventually they will control most of the market on OS's"".  

I should've realized at the time they didn't know what an operating system was. At the time they were still integrating computers into every workplace. 

But he blew me off... Like I was some sort of dumbass.       It's not my money, sure but if this fk wasn't so ignorant he would realize that I might know a little something given my tech experience. 

People who aren't ignorant will at least take into some consideration what you're saying before they decline any advice or at least politely decline with ""I will think about it"".

\&gt; it can dip twice: until buy orders outweighs sell orders it can dip again.

\&gt; rational dip: market movements are not reversible.

\&gt; unoriginal: buyers already bought and will cut loses/take profit amplifying loses and limiting wins.

\&gt; DCA vs timing: variable apprutonity cost allow a portion to be sold lower than the average entry cost.

\&gt; shorting: sellers presume same position at a lower point on a downward chart.

\&gt; bears on steroids: stronger bears on downward charts.

\&gt; bulls catching breath: bulls need to cover their positions.

price can meet sharp drops especially after failing to sustain a higher level.

# What is it?

Basic Attention Token (BAT) is a utility token based on Ethereum technology  for digital advertising and are used as a digital currency between publishers, users and advertisers on the **Brave** browser. The browser prevents advertisers from invading users space and privately measures users attention on certain websites. Brave browser is 2-8 times faster than Chrome and Safari.

# How does it work?

This token aims to ""save"" the digital advertising system in this digital era when the privacy of internet users is heavily invaded.  Under the current conditions, web users are publicly monitored by advertisers and browsers through various channels. User privacy is not respected by advertisers since browsers can keep track of which pages you visit often, which accounts you follow and in no time, blow the phone with a myriad of ads with your ""interests"" that they have discovered. This changes with the introduction of the Brave Browser which offers a private platform for its users.  BATs are used by advertisers who trade in BAT to purchase advertising space from content creators and user attention from brave browser users. The amount of time spent on the ad is labeled 'attention' and users can also allow the ads to run on their devices at a small cost, offering BAT tokens. Publishers and content creators receive advertising revenue and user contributions or donations to create better content while users are rewarded with BATs for their attention (where users are privately ""linked"" to their interests, confirmed anonymously and presented with meaningful advertisements that they are interested in). Users have the choice of whether or not to opt-in to see the ads, which use a separate open source component. When users opt to receive ads on the platform, the ads will be shown based on their interests and confirmed anonymously.  In November 2017, the founders of BAT announced that users could now give tokens directly to their favorite channels, thereby increasing user and publisher activity on Brave. But what is BAT token? BAT, an ERC20 token, is developed on a smart contract based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token uses Proof of Work (PoW) technology. However, to maintain network security, use **Zero-Knowledge Password** proof, (ZKP). This is a process that does not require password swapping when logging into your account. Lack of passwords means they shouldn't be stolen. Users are required to demonstrate that they know some secret questions about the person on the other side.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for BAT are MyEtherWallet, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Very fast and intuitive browser
2. Interesting partnerships
3. Great devs team

**Cons**

1. Low adoption
2. Scalability issues
3. As stated in its white paper, \*\*‘\*\**in the early stage, the flow of BAT token will be regulated by Brave’.* So, for now, it seems pretty centralized",1634831330,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcus68/knowyourcrypto_38_basic_attention_token_bat/

London, October 20th, 2021 - The Algorand Foundation announced today that it has awarded software-development company Applied Blockchain a grant for the integration of its award-winning SILENTDATA platform with the Algorand blockchain, enabling users to present privacy-preserving proof of their traditional financial activity.

SILENTDATA, developed by Applied Blockchain, enables private off-chain data to be verified on-chain without revealing the underlying private data to anyone. Initially focussed on Open Banking data, the Algorand Foundation grant will support SILENTDATA in enabling businesses to create privacy-preserving NFTs of their invoices, and present these to a liquidity pool on the Algorand blockchain.

The integration of SILENTDATA on the Algorand blockchain marks a significant step forward in the Future of Finance (FutureFi), the convergence of traditional banking and decentralized models into a unified system. It will enable more efficient and open forms of lending, where verification of sensitive off-chain data while maintaining full data privacy of the party concerned plays a critical part.

Adi Ben-Ari, Founder and CEO of Applied Blockchain, added: “Our team has been building applications on the Algorand blockchain for almost two years, including a world-class, fully-integrated NFT marketplace, a comprehensive project launchpad, and many more. Algorand has an amazing team, a very active and growing community, and a world class blockchain, and we look forward to bringing SILENTDATA to this ecosystem to be part of FutureFi.”

In August, SILENTDATA won the award in the category for “Best Digital Identity Solution” at the Open Banking Expo Awards 2021.

Addie Wagenknecht, Head of Global Ecosystems at the Algorand Foundation, added “Applied Blockchain has been a particularly active partner in the Algorand ecosystem, and we are very excited to see the potential for SILENTDATA in enabling convergence of traditional and decentralised models of finance.”

30,CryptoCurrency,Gwsb1,Coincidence? I don't think so.,"Excuse me while I put on my tin foil hat. 

Ok.  Let's go.  On April 14 2001 Coinbase stock started trading on the NASDAQ at 381. On that same day Bitcoin futures traded at an ATH of 65,520.

On October 19 Proshares Bitcoin futures ETF , BITO started trading at 40.88. On October 20 the Bitcoin futures traded at an ATH of 67,680.

Coincidence?  You must be kidding.  Market manipulation? Of course it is.

You might say the market is too big to manipulate but the /BTC contract only has a daily average of 10,000 contracts traded . A total  value of $3 billion.  That is miniscule compared to say the soybean market at a daily volume of 200,000 contracts and $7 billion in the beans.

* Altcoins are ""better versions"" of Bitcoin because they aim to plug the cryptocurrency's shortcomings.
* Altcoins like stablecoins can potentially fulfill Bitcoin's original promise of a medium for daily transactions.
* Certain altcoins, such as Ethereum's ether and Ripple's XRP, have already gained traction among mainstream institutions, resulting in high valuations.
* Investors can choose from a wide variety of altcoins that perform different functions in the crypto economy.
* Total marketcap of whole crypto market excluding BTC is making CUP and HANDLE pattern which is bullish sign results in addition of another trillion in marketcap
* Bitcoin has moved 25k usd rally but we didnt see any significant increase on ALT SEASON. SO in this Alt SEASON we way see huge pumps in projects like ADA, SOL, COTI, MATIC, VET etc

Highlights:

* ""The “risk-based” regime is broken, suggests the study. The authors found that the varying risk profiles made “almost no difference” to banks’ willingness to open an account; CSPS (lawyers, etc) were even less sensitive to risk.""
* ""The study shows that the grunt-work of aml is being “pushed onto a private sector which can’t or won’t do it,” says Mr Sharman. “Banks are unable or unwilling to make the fine-grained risk judgments the system demands, because they use standardised, generic procedures.”""
* ""Mr Sharman says he was surprised by the level of risk-insensitivity, because “**some of our approaches were ridiculously dodgy**”.""

83,CryptoCurrency,cidadefalcao,Seven GOOD things about the bitcoin Futures-Based ETF,"**THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY THE FUTURES ETFs. THIS IS JUST A LIST OF REASONS OF WHY BITCOIN PRICE CAN ULTIMATELY BENEFIT FROM HAVING THEM COMPARED TO NOT HAVING THEM AROUND. IF YOU CAN BUY SPOT BTC AND WANT BTC EXPOSURE, BUY SPOT BTC**

We have seen in the last few weeks a lot of bashing on the recently approved ETFs (so far, ProShares, which has been launched, plus Valkyrie and VanEck, which will launch tomorrow and next week respectively). I do not disagree with any of the arguments around (apart from occasional ""duh they gonna suppress price through paper BTC"" argument, which is simply wrong - I explain that in my first point in the following). Now I proceed to list a few GOOD things about a futures ETF in comparison to a spot ETF, mostly because I've seen no one mentioning those so far. Again I stress that **I agree with the arguments for why spot &gt; futures**. **No need to repeat them and say that futures is shit and spot is good because I agree with that.** I am just presenting a silver lining here given what we have in the markets now.

I) The Futures ETF, by not requiring the ETF issuer to hold bitcoin but just future contracts from a particular exchange, is **more easily auditable**. The daily open interest on bitcoin futures at the CME can be checked at [https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.volume.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.volume.html), making it very difficult for the ETF issuer to increase the ETF shares supply without going long on the futures contract. With a spot ETF, you need to trust the issuer (or the custodian) holds the bitcoins because they very likely will not reveal the address where the bitcoins are (for either security reasons or regulation reasons, or both).

II) With the Futures ETF, there is **ZERO risk the coins can be stolen, confiscated, or lost**, because they hold no coins. By holding a contract that provides exposure to the underlying, the ""carrying risk"" is held by those buying spot and shorting futures to capture the premium. One of the main sources of this premium (in addition to the time value of money), which is not small and is the main disadvantage of the futures ETF) is precisely having to manage the security by your own.

III) With the Futures ETF, you can **benefit in the short term by a rapid increase in BTC prices**. While a spot bitcoin ETF would ideally perfectly track the bitcoin price, the Futures ETF track future contracts. The futures premium over spot can increase over short time periods, providing a higher return than simply holding bitcoin spot.

IV) With the bitcoin futures ETF, you can **benefit from shifts in interest rates**, should them ever occur. If the interest rates go down, the new future contract will trade at a lower price than they would otherwise. When rolling them, the ""contango bleed"" (the loss by selling a close to spot futures to buy an above spot futures expiring at a later date) will be reduced. If the interest rates go up, those holding the ETF will instantly benefit as the futures premium increase. Over time though, they will lose as the contango bleed increases. Admittedly, this is a very limited benefit because it goes away over time.

V) **If there is a big crash, you can benefit from an ""inverse contango bleed""/carrying premium** as futures may trade at a lower price than spot. For those holding the ETF through the crash event though, their losses can be magnified (although not necessarily: the futures price might decrease less than the spot price). This is not necessarily an advantage as it has a good and bad side but, with the futures ETF you have the possibility to have, at some point, a carrying premium. With a spot bitcoin ETF, this cannot happen.

VI) **Many institutional investors are restricted from taking positions in foreign-traded ETFs either by regulation or by mandate, so the futures ETF is all they have**. Same for some individuals. Again, not exactly an advantage over spot, but an advantage over nothing nevertheless. An hypothetical advantage over spot in that regard is that some institutional investors might be restrained from investing in some ""riskier"" ETFs, which in terms of security as explained in I) might be the case of the spot ETF but not the futures ETF. I admit however that this is a very speculative reasoning.

VII) Due to the return on the cash holdings (a futures ETF typically holds cash/treasuries and go long on future contracts), **a futures ETF might offer a lower effective total expense ratio/management fee than the spot ETF** (particularly if interest rates rise one day). Even if they do not rise though, a small return will be earned in the cash, which is not the case of the spot ETF. Additionally, due to competition with spot ETFs in the future, the futures ETF issuers might be able to reduce their fees even further, capturing some market share from spot ETF issuers and benefiting investors.",1634828027,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qctlml/seven_good_things_about_the_bitcoin_futuresbased/
86,CryptoCurrency,jgarcya,Why doge is a better investment than shiba inu.,"Things people look at for decision whether to invest in a coin...

Is it useful? Supply? Market cap? Age of project? Speed of transactions? Costs of transactions?

USEFULNESS

Is doge useful? Yes.. It is accepted by 1000's of retailers... It is accepted by major League teams... It is a coin.

Is shiba useful? Other than swapping it, or staking it, for bone and leash, and the creation of shitty nft... It is basically useless.

SUPPLY

Doge... Roughly 300 billion with a cap of 5 billion added annually..... It is deflationary in relation to supply...

Shiba inu.... 1 quadrillion tokens( claimed half burned) with a current supply of 395 Trillion...

For doge to add 1 Trillion coins it would take 200 years...

MARKET CAP

Doge... Between 31-33 billion.... Roughly 8yrs old.

Shiba inu ... 12 billion...just over 1 yr old.

Doge.... has 4.4 million addresses

Shiba .... Has 760,000 addresses

SPEED of transactions

Both doge n shiba have fast transactions.... Doge is currently being worked on for cheaper n faster transactions.

Doge... 1 minute transactions... Btc has 10 minute blocks/transactions.

Shiba inu.... Erc- 20 token... Has fast transactions.

COST OF TRANSACTIONS

Doge...2.35 doge per transaction... But developers are working on making it faster.

Shiba inu... Since it is an erc-20 token..... Fees are RIDICULOUS.. Could cost $20-30 per transaction.

CONCLUSION...

Dogecoin beats shiba on every level, except speed..

But currently doge is under development... Fees and speed are being increased...

Also an wth/doge bridge is being created... Which means anything that can be done on the ethereum chain..... Will be possible with doge/eth.

So as far as one coin vs the other... My $ is on doge.

This is not financial advice... Just my stupid opinion... And I hold both doge n shiba.",1634827946,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qctkn8/why_doge_is_a_better_investment_than_shiba_inu/

92,CryptoCurrency,longboardsilver,For newbies of crypto,"I've been in the crypto world for a couple of months only. I've been learning my first steps, made my first mistakes, traded too many coins, learned what FOMO meant after I went FOMO... Lists goes on...

But I want to share one thing with other newbies that are trying thise crazy world for the first time.

Instead of trying to gather as much information as possible on YouTube, Reddit, Telegram and such, try learning by trial and error first.

The internet can be overwhelming with information, and first time mistakes can be very costly. But if you do a small investment to educate yourself before you put down bags of money into it, you will be better prepared.

I invested 150.00 first hand, knowing I would probably lose it. I treated those 150 like if it was 150,000. Caring for every cent.

Those first 150.00 allowed me to learn the ropes, gas fees, transfers to wallets, different blockchains. I cried when I hit bottom with a shit coin, even tho it was only 20.00, and jumped around when I lived my first 30% pump.

In the end, I lost maybe 30% of my initial investment over 2 months,  mostly on gas fees. So I took a crash course of crypto for about 50.00 bucks, before deciding if crypto was for me. 

It is like renting a car and flooring it hard before buying the real deal, instead of flooring and crashing your brand new car.

Now, I'm no expert and I can't give any financial advice. But investing a small amount to learn how to read charts, touch all the buttons, test different exchanges (cex and defi) will give you a good idea about potential gains and losses before you go all in.

I see everywhere ""do not invest more than you can afford to lose"" and it is a 100% true. But preparing yourself mentally by trading with a small amount and treating like a lot more money will give you the experience to truly understand what it means.

4,CryptoCurrency,Diatery,"PSA: Facebook is about to rename itself, here are the 3 scams to avoid","Zuckerberg thinks his company can escape a decade of privacy invasion and scandal by renaming Facebook, and it's supposed to happen around October 28th. The reason its notable to crypto is due to his interest in staking a part of the metaverse, the virtual realm where things have real world ownership, like NFTs and virtual currencies.  

But I digress: Scammers know this, and they are ready to separate fools from their money by posing as whatever the new thing is.  Heres the scams I see every time big tech news happens that you should be aware of: 

1. The Youtube Livestream

You will see videos of Zuckerberg talking about the rebrand and crypto, and there will be a link to send money to this for a 2x return or an airdrop.  You may also see a way to sign up for a free small amount.  Never click on such things, all scams. In some cases they go as far as deepfaking videos!

2. The early coin listing

Just because the ticket symbol is the same doesnt mean its the same coin. You can mint similar initials on different chains if you are fast enough, and they will. Prepare to see these pop up on uniswap, pancakeswap, etc.  Use a search engine to find the real one. Fake IDO pages are also common, so dont click on anything that isnt on the official domain -- and even then, be careful with fan/group pages spoofing to look official

3. The legit press release

The most dangerous scams are the ones that fool journalists. Some clever hackers have done this in the oast where they buy expensive PR blasts to send a truthful sounding release that gets picked up by major websites before the scam is discovered.

Money flows into Bitcoin causing its dominance to go up, which reduces altcoin dominance.

Once new highs are reached late investors start looking for new opportunities big cap alts (think top 15).

With so much new money in the market this is then followed by altcoin mania aka alt season - this is where the biggest gains are made.

At that point you don’t really need to be an expert to make money because everything pumps regardless of fundamentals (strong marketing/community helps a lot).

7,CryptoCurrency,canadianproud25,Worldwide power outage and crypto,"I think it's safe to say most of us take electricity for granted and we never really think about anything going wrong. But the truth is our power grid is not invincible and it can be temporarily taken down. 

Let's hypothetically say that an EMP or a very large solar flare hits the earth, causing a worldwide power outage for 1-3 weeks before everything can be restored. Now I know this would be terrible as many people would die(no heat,ac,food chain supply etc..), but when everything finally comes back online, what do you think that would do to the whole crypto market? Do you believe it would resume from where it last was online? Do you think there would be a major crash? 
Side question: anyone transferring crypto at the time of the ""shut off"", would those peoples transactions be lost forever or would they be able to recover them?",1634827205,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qctb7t/worldwide_power_outage_and_crypto/
10,CryptoCurrency,AyeselTPW,Bitcoin Supercycle - Fact or Fiction,"What are your thoughts on the Bitcoin SuperCycle (SC) narrative? 

The word SuperCycle (SC) has been showing it's face more and more on crypto twitter since I read a report by Dan Held in December [Bitcoin Supercycle](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/a-bitcoin-supercycle) 

&amp;#x200B;

For those that don't know what a SC is:

Bitcoin has been known for it's 4 year cycles with a bull-run spurred on by each Bitcoin halving. 

&gt; A Bitcoin supercycle is **a thesis suggesting that BTC will continue rallying and print fresh all-time highs instead of entering a bear market** and having massive 80% drawdowns just like what happened during the end of the 2013 and 2017 bull cycles 

&amp;#x200B;

The theory is that, since Bitcoin is starting to see institutional investment and with record printing of money worldwide, Bitcoin is starting to become the Store of Value (SoV) it was intended to be aka Gold 2.0

&amp;#x200B;

But is Bitcoin now in a SC? The May correction certainly would be a strong argument against this. 

It is also possible to argue that Bitcoin has been in a SC since it's inception and that the corrections are just part of that cycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

The narrative however does annoy me a little, as it does seem to be based more on hopium than fact. 

A commodities SC isn't apparent until a few years in to cycle. So how are we to know for sure  that Bitcoin is in a SC until a few years have passed?

&amp;#x200B;

The dangers of the SC narrative is that there are a lot of new people entering the crypto space and if this narrative starts to carry weight, and in the event of a 2022 correction, a lot of people are going to be inducted into the crypto hodl hall of fame for another 3-4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

There is also the danger of people leaving profit on the table with the ""predicted"" end of bull-run to happen Dec/Jan. If the correction in May thought us anything it's that even if Bitcoin is in a SC it is certainly not immune to 50%+ corrections. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts on whether you share my fears on a SC or are you convinced Bitcoin will continue to macro go up yearly for the next 8-9 years?",1634827151,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qctakn/bitcoin_supercycle_fact_or_fiction/

If you’ve ridden the price down, it is *possible* that it will have been worth it and that price will rebound. 

If you’ve invested at the ATH, watched BTC and ETH get right back up there and are still thinking to yourself “we’re next” you may need to take a second and check in on the market.

Does your coin/token have any releases or updates planned?

Does your coin/token have any social hype?

If the answer to both is no, or begins with, “well, I guess we have…” you are about to get left behind.

Some of us made a bad investment, plain and simple. We invested in projects that are fully played out *lookin at you ETC* and now we’re sitting here holding somebody else’s massive burlap sack, only to realize the bag is long since empty. 

It’s okay. But as things heat up, and you look at all those *hot new coins* with envy and jealousy and think, “Algo’s just a fad”

16,CryptoCurrency,Mediocre-Training904,Help A UK Newbie TP,"Hello all,

I have relatively conservative sell orders set across all my coins, as I want to lock in 75% profits before this bull run is over, ready to reinvest during the next bear (letting the remaining 25% run in case the wildest predictions come to fruition).

I'm in the UK, using Binance, and planning to sell to USDT, as most of my coins don't have a GBP pair. 

What I'm unsure of is whether to keep those profits in USDT on the exchange, ready to eventually reinvest, or convert to GBP and send to my bank so I can set aside fiat for tax before I send what I have left back to an exchange (tax is a whole other question, but one for an accountant when I find one). Thoughts?

Slightly worried about Tether, so if I were to take the ""convert USDT to GBP and send to bank"" route, any ideas on the best / cheapest way to do that? And any particularly crypto-friendly banks? Anyone used Monzo for withdrawals?

Can you add your advice to the list?,"Thanks to Crypto i started to realize how much i'm spending day after day on things i simply don't need. I can spend those money and invest them for a better future life. Some of the money are literally thrown away.

Here is my humble list of things which you can cut off so you can have more to invest in Crypto:

1. Nicotine and drugs - this is my personal number one. It's self-explanatory, cigarettes and drugs are the worst thing you can give your money for. They are expensive and cutting them will provide you with very decent cash flow for investment. I don't need to explain the health benefits, you all know them. 
2. Bottled water - if you have access to clean water from your tap i don't think you need to buy any from the store. In some cases tap water is even better. It's good for the environment as well!!!
3. Transportation costs - most probably, where you live, there is public transportation which usually is cheaper than driving you car every day to work. If your work is on a walking distance just walk. It's also environmental friendly.
4. Bank fees - with a little bit of research you can find legit ways to avoid many bank taxes. Having several cards and accounts will drain your wallet drop by drop. 
5. Food - learn to cook, it will not only taste better but will save you a lot if you are only on ramen and fast food. Restaurants are the most expensive option, you will save the most out of them.
6. Energy costs at home - remove unused plugs from the sockets. If you have appliance at home which you rarely use remove the plug from the socket it can save you few dollars per year. 

Sure there are a lot but these are the ones which came to my mind. Any other suggestions?",1634826689,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qct4po/do_you_have_the_feeling_that_you_buy_stuff_that/

I was looking to buy some BABYDOGE (BNB) and mistakenly bought the fake one on ETH. I made the mistake so it's on me. Obviously I can't swap it back for ETH now, it complains that there is not enough liquidity. I am fine to consider that money is gone, it was an amount small enough that I can afford to lose.

The question I have is does anyone know how the scammers prevent you from swapping out of their token. Uniswap doesn't say anything but shibaswap reports insufficient liquidity when you try to swap out. I do see people making swap outs of the token though in etherscan, presumably the scammers sucking out whatever liquidity is in (there are people swapping in too but who knows if it's real). But how do they scammers me from doing it? How do they maintain a fake liquidity of zero? It doesn't matter how low of an amount i try, it says insufficient liquidity even with one token.

 The interesting thing is the token is registered on unicrypt as having locked $450k liquidity for 2 years. But obviously that's either fake or still prone to some kind of manipulation.

My goal is to learn to recognize the signs of a scam token like this one and keep on learning.",1634825899,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcsuiu/questions_on_how_to_recognize_scammy_tokens/

Some new ideas i have yet to come across and want to utilize are:

-a 9 square grid that holds 9 NFTs. Depending 9n the arrangement of said NFTs, the holders creates a ""farm"" that mints tokens and grabts additional benefits like free lottery or extra minting power.
-a fusing system to fuse 2 lesser NFTs to gain a better more rare one that provides unique benefits and perks later on. (I have ideas but not fleshed out enough)

68,CryptoCurrency,TanksForPlayingIO,What is Divisibility in Cryptocurrency tokens?,"# What is divisibility?

Let me break down what divisibility is.

We are all familiar with dollars and cents, there are many currencies out there which use this system (USD/AUD/etc). One dollar is one hundred cents and you can’t really have less than one cent in your bank account. The dollar is therefore divisible but cents are not — you can divide a dollar into one hundred cents, but you cannot divide cents down further. The precision to which a currency can be divided is measured by how many decimal places it supports. In the case of the dollar, it has 2 decimal place precision (hereby known as a decimal of 2).

Cryptocurrencies are revolutionising the banking system, and with it they are exploring new frontiers of divisibility. Bitcoin for example has 8 decimal places — i.e. it is possible to send and receive as little as 0.00000001 BTC (0.0006 USD at todays price of 60k USD/BTC). If every person on earth had the smallest unit of Bitcoin, it would only require 77 BTC! Should the price of BTC ever reach $1B / BTC (thank you hyper-inflation) — the smallest unit would cost 0.01 USD, suddenly the smallest unit may not be enough…

Ethereum takes it to the next level (of course it does…) by supporting 18 decimal places of precision! That’s quite hard to fathom on it’s own so another way to put it would be to say if every person on earth had a billion of the smallest unit of Ethereum it would only require about 60 ETH. For the chemistry nuts out there, that’s about the same precision as individual atoms in 0.2 mg of carbon. (P.S. If I’m wrong with these numbers, just read the comments, whenever someone is wrong on the internet there will be someone around to correct them…)

# What does an indivisible token look like?

There is no mathematical difference between an indivisible token and a divisible token, it’s just a question of where the decimal point is located.

For example, there will only ever be 21 million BTC BUT given BTC is divisible to 8 decimal places, there is a total of 15 digits to play with. BTC could have started as indivisible with 2,100,000,000,000,000 coins (2.1 quadrillion) and it would have been mathematically equivalent. One important difference between the two would be the value of each BTC which would be now be fractions of a cent.

In fact there are many “meme” coins/tokens out there which have insane numbers of supply. Shiba Inu for example has 394,796,000,000,000 SHIB tokens! (394 Trillion)

Let’s imagine that there is an indivisible token. What would it look like? Would it even work on a DeX?

As mentioned before, there are limits to precision and as such we already deal with the consequences of indivisibility, but these usually happen at decimal precisions we do not care about.

Let’s imagine a token called IND which is indivisible and is traded on UniSwap.

You connect to UniSwap and see the price of IND is 0.1 IND/ETH. If you had 1 ETH and there was sufficient liquidity, you might expect to get 10 IND tokens. So far so good. What if you only had 0.05 ETH? Now we have a problem. A divisible token would have given you 0.5 IND — but IND cannot be divided! You cannot trade. You are locked out of owning ANY IND until you can spend 0.1 ETH.

Back to the example of buying 1 ETH — with slippage and fees, you’d likely be only able to get 9 IND tokens instead of 10. It wouldn’t cost the full 1 ETH — but you *wanted* to spend 1 ETH and so you are leaving some ETH on the table. Not such a good deal after all…

Those who have been involved with stock market trading might be familiar with indivisibility. You cannot ordinarily own a fraction of a stock. This indivisibility in infamously used by Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway to preclude investors who cannot find a spare $426,189 USD (at the time of writing) down the back of the couch to get into their exclusive class A stock. Oof…

Imagine if Bitcoin was indivisible — you would have to pay over $60k USD to get started! Would it be even more valuable if there were exactly 21 million positions at the table?

Some argue that those who come from a stock background are scared off by Bitcoin’s high valuation because they either believe Bitcoin is indivisible or they want a nice whole round number of coins. There is “utility” in a large supply of tokens and small value — namely that people feel psychologically better about owning a large number of coins. Some also dream that if one day their token or coin can get to $1 they will be rich with their large current-day holdings (ignoring the fact that their coin/token would need to have a market cap larger than the entire world’s wealth…)

# What are the pros and cons of indivisibility?

## Pros

It’s nice, it’s different, it’s unusual.

It looks more like an arcade token.

## Cons

Lack of flexibility — The minimum entry price of a crypto porojects function is limited to 1 token, and which impacts Defi, DEXs, trading, utility and more.

Billion dollar problem — If (or is it when…) the market cap is around a billion say on a Billion token project , the price of the token will start to approach $1 and beyond, which now starts to affect the accessibility of the project and its features perhaps. Worth noting that the largest players in the crypto gaming space have market capitalization in the multiple billions, so this isn’t a theoretical concern.

Leaving money on the table — Every transaction which otherwise would have purchased 0.9 fraction of a tokan can’t do it. That money isn’t going into the the projects market cap because it can’t.",1634825042,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcsjvk/what_is_divisibility_in_cryptocurrency_tokens/

Let’s examine the differences between both coins.

Origins: Dogecoin is the original meme crypto, which was pretty much created just for that purpose. Shiba Inu was similarly created for the same purpose, but some people have already referred to it as the “Dogecoin Killer.”

Technical Differences: Dogecoin is based on the Scrypt algorithm, which allows for faster creation. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu was built on the Etherum blockchain, which makes it stand out.

Supply: Dogecoin is constantly being created and there is no limit in the supply of it. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is capped at a supply of 500 trillion.

Market Cap: Dogecoin has been around longer and has a $31 billion market cap. Shiba Inu’s market cap is around $11 billion.

Final Thoughts: Shiba Inu’s price is way less than Dogecoin, but that could change in the future.

An eighth of a gram, please. Jorge Pena, 20, figured that eighth came to three small flakes -- the equivalent of $5. After getting a trim one recent weekday in the town of Tumeremo, he handed them over to his barber, who, satisfied with Pena’s calculation, quickly pocketed them. “You can pay for everything with gold,” Pena says.
&gt;In its place, the dollar has become the de facto choice in Caracas and other major cities. Along the western border with Colombia, the peso is the dominant currency. It’s used in more than 90% of transactions in the biggest city in the region, San Cristobal, according to the research firm Ecoanalitica. Down on the southern border with Brazil, the real is often the currency of choice. And the euro and cryptocurrencies have their niches in parts of the country, too.
&gt;They use hand tools to break shards off nuggets and then carry them in their pockets, often wrapped in bolivar bills -- one of the few remaining uses for the currency.

If possible, im looking for some advice since I'm an idiot. I finally got into crypto earlier this year and I tried out 4-5 different wallets to see which ones I liked best. 

Turned out that while Celsius was cool for the small APR, I wanted more so I tried to consolidate my USDC to Trustwallet instead. Only I did it as USDC ERC20 instead of transferring it to a normal coin first and now it appears stuck.

81,CryptoCurrency,cto_juve,The “Are We Early” Debate - a thought,"Hi all, first of all congrats to the holders and a genuine hope that all in this sub are in the green now or certainly getting there. 

I have read a few posts over the last few weeks and months questioning whether or not we are early, how far has the ship sailed etc... it wasn’t until speaking to a friend today though, who told me that his kid is begging him to help him set up an account on an exchange linked up to his bank etc (he’s 15)

There is a whole generation of young people who are learning about crypto/blockchain, studying computing and programming, interested in investing and finances that are not yet at the age where they can independently buy crypto. (I know there are still ways, I mean generally speaking) 

I believe it isn’t ridiculous to say that the amount of new money entering the crypto sphere every year from those turning 18/of legal age is enough to keep driving the market cap of crypto currencies higher and higher. 

Any thoughts or data/analysis of this anywhere?

What do you guys think? How early are we in the grand scheme of things?

84,CryptoCurrency,mciv2424,"Just a reminder that if you have high interest rate debt, you should make sure to pay that off before going all in on crypto","I truly want people in crypto to make the best life decisions. The more that everyone in the space is successful and has more money to put into crypto, the better it is for everyone holding it. 

I had a friend ask me how much he should put into crypto versus what he should put into paying off debt. He has a bit of 10-20% rate debt. I know crypto offers 2x, 5x, 10x opportunity for bigtime payoffs, but many alts are not going to make it and will lose money, so paying off debt that is guaranteed to save you 10-20% interest per year is the best thing to do. 

By nature crypto (like equities) attracts some gamblers and people looking to get out of bad financial holes. Just a reminder that the best long term plan is to tighten up your spending and be as frugal as possible to pay off your high (IMO 10%+) interest rate debt first and then start putting your money into crypto or other investments.",1634824548,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcsdgc/just_a_reminder_that_if_you_have_high_interest/

88,CryptoCurrency,Few-Opportunity-4325,IONQ and QC crypto mining,"Hi guys. I would like to share with you following idea to consider: 

IONQ and QC crypto mining

 As you probably know IONQ is recent deSPAC and first publicly-traded pure-quantum company. The company is proud to be the leader in quantum computing (QC) market. The company is backed by Amazon, Samsung, Kia, Hyuandai, Bosch, Lockheed Martin, HP, Bill Gates' BEV, Michael Dell and others. The biggest shareholder here is Alphabet (Google) with &gt;10% stake. Currently products of IONQ have highest quantum volume of all QCs (65K x more than products of competitors) and they are already available for public on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure. The business models is QCaas (quantum computers as a service). And QCaas market is estimtaed to be worth $26B by 2030, while the enterprise value of IONQ is only ca. $1.6B. 

https://thequantumdaily.com/2021/08/19/quantum-computing-as-a-service-market-sizing-how-we-did-it/ 

Many think that quantum computer are millions years away, but ""they are just here, just now"". IONQ in their investor presentation says that inflection point will be as soon as in 2023, while ""broad quantum advantage"" will appear in 2025. And there are many breakthrouugh, disruptive and world-changing applications of that technology, like better optimization, faster new drug discovery (in 2028), better materials for EVs and others, like preventing next pandemic. 

source: 
https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/quantum-computing-can-help-prevent-the-onslaught-of-the-next-pandemic/2259031/

And now one of the most exciting (based on what's most trending now) application is QC crypto mining This article shows that this is VIABLE, using so called Grover's algorithms. 

Source: 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-btc-safe-grovers-algorithm-151737053.html 

And now: if - hypothetically - IONQ's work on that and find an effective sollution from QC crypto mining and further patents it technology, it could potentially grab most of crypto mining market, which has potential of $100B+ given the current price of BTC and the fact that ca. 2M of BTC remains not mined. This opportunity looks very promising, given that the company estimates to have $523M of revenue in 2026 and $271M EBIDTA in that year. And here it might potentially boost it revenue to multiple dozen billion dollar. 

Source of 10NO'S Rev/EBIDTA estimetes, Investor Presentation: 
https://www.dmytechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lonQDeck-6.44-print.pdf

So why not use this, if IONO is the leader of QC market, with so strong advantage over its rivals? The confidence is so strong, that the CEO dedared in some of recent interviews that he's not worried about competitors as for now. 

Unfortunately, Peter Chapman, CEO of IONQ, rejected that he's working on that potential application. He said ""We have not started doing any kind of real work on how to mine Bitcoin with a quantum computer. We run jobs for thousands of customers. So maybe there's somebody out there working on that, but it's not something we're working on"". 

Source: 
https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-273799/ 

And I think this is not the right thing, that they are not working on it, beacuse they are leaders and ifthey don't do it, someone else WILL much likely do it. And personally I think that this would be unfair, if a breakthrough technology company earned only small portion of money from QCaas and the real money (big money) are earned by third parties. 

And now imagine that potential extra cash from BTC mining. Not only may it boost stock price, but could also help the company to fund further active growth and development to strengthen its leadership and supremacy over rivals. 

Thus, I suggest that we all- minority shareholders and members of that community/board - regardless of differences between us - SHOULD write emails to the company (info@ionq.com) to convince or at least encourage them to work on potential application of their QC technology and using Grover's algorithms - CRYPTO MINING. 

And if we - minority shareholders, members of that conmmunity - UNITE and try to encourage IONQ to work on it, they SHOULD consider it., because the voice of minority investors who invested and trusted them should be considered.

Furthermore, personally I think that engagaement of IONQ in such an additional project which is associated with core activity, has almost only advantages, I actually don't see any disadvantages of it at all. First, the company, given its current cash position, strong backings and some prestige as of being a public company has all the resources to engage in such project. Second, the positive outcome from such project could be EXTREMELY beneficial to all stakeholders, the company would have extra cash for growth, shareholders would profit and that would also come with social benefit. 

Why the last? Because of ""clean crypto mining"" idea, which is really relevant here. If those Grover's algorithms enable faster crypto mining, it will mean that the same output (some amount of mined BTCS) require MUCH lower input (energy consumed). Thus, crypto mining - which will be continued regardless of circumstances- by applying QC technology will leave CONSIDERABLY LOWER carbon print. 

I invite you all for real, essential discussion about that and to contacting the company with your suggestions about that. Please comment here about your thoughts, suggestions, findings.",1634824365,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcsb3y/ionq_and_qc_crypto_mining/

This sub has given me great advice at times and generally I love the posts here, but the content has been getting worse and worse for the last few months. Just to name a few examples:

- Everyone keeps asking the same questions that were literally asked days ago by other people. At least produce your own content if you want to earn moons? 

- so many people keep posting content that makes crypto sound like some weird childish thing. Most of us are in it for the money and a few crypto words keep it funny, but a lot of you give me second hand embarrassment. Even the comments.. whenever someone asks a question, most comments are useless. Can this moon hype settle down a little bit already? 

- these extreme posts about getting to all time highs (like 100k by December,..) or every beginner should wait with an investment bla bla. All these posts honestly just make me scared to invest and I can only imagine what it does to everyone else! We all need to chill out and not make predictions that rather scare people from investing in it. Advice is good, but don't make it sound like investing is the 100% best or worst thing right now 

Can we go back to hyping better, more informed content? I came here (and I think many other people) to learn more about crypto and specific coins. And I know that other people have said what I have said before, but it frustrates me to see this sub deteriorate

I went there with my friends and that's when I first saw her. She was not only hot and but had those geeky looks that gave me an impression that she knows some good shit about crypto.

We starting meeting each other, and our mutual interest for crypto led to our mutual interest into each other.

After some food and talk, she gave me that sexy look and told me that she Hodls 69 Bitcoins and would like to show me. I was like, holy fuchs. She strips off her clothes and then removes mine, and then I see a Bitcoin tattoo right above her pus*y. She then said in her raspy voice, ""Do you want those 69 bitcoins, let me show you what I hodl."" She squats down over my face to assume the 69 position with Bitcoin tattoo over my face and farts.

She feels embarrassed, she stands up and apologises. She squats down for another go but farts again, she gets up and apologises again. Before she can have a third go, I told her,  “yeah this isn’t really for me, I’m not having 67 more of those in my face”.

23,CryptoCurrency,InevitableSoundOf,It's not unusual to see a 20% dip after a solid run like this.,"Bitcoin on the daily gives a beautiful trend line up, seeing a whole lot of green. The sky is the limit.

Yet Bitcoin and crypto are known for their volatility. So just be mentally prepared for a dip to happen as it cools down from the current run before getting back to climbing. Not saying it's going to happen just that it would be unusual not too.

It's not out of the normal for a 20% dip to come along, and if you look back at earlier this year in February and March, it was very much like that on its way up to 64k.

It dips then pushes on.

This sub is renowned for freaking out, and so once a dip happens you'll see everyone go from ""buy the dip"", ""this is fine"" to ""the bull is over"" very quickly. You can get caught up in it easily enough.

So just be prepared, by

1. Asking yourself if you are long term holding.

2. Don't react to the sentiment around you, otherwise you'll make rash decisions. You need to make your own decisions, not social media.

3. Determine if it is triggered by an actual impactful event and not just people guessing or fud'ing

For example the April dump was due to a whole bunch of miners offloading BTC to get cash to relocate operations out of China. Creating a amplification of the sell off. Whereas February people freaked out about options expiration and then just as quickly forgot about it as BTC quickly bounced back.

30,CryptoCurrency,MrT-1000,Don't Get Overzealous with the FOMO,"We've now reached the ""nothing can go wrong phase"" of a bull-run, where pretty much anything/everything you put your money in is making money.


I'm here to tell you to please take a step back, both from the discussion threads and the general subreddit/crypto sites/channels to temper expectations and stop feeding into the FOMO and circlejerking over random coins mooning. I know many of you are thinking this is it and Bitcoin isn't stopping until it hits 100k and you need to throw all your life savings in coins right now. Please don't. 3 months ago the suicide hotline links were posted because of the crash. Might we have one again in a month, 3 months, a year? Who knows; I cannot provide any financial advice but for the purposes of your mental health and sanity, just slow down. If anything, I recommend DCA'ing in, maybe more so at the next mega-dip, and yes there will be another dip, and a lot of money will be lost. I know some of you despise fiat and working at your fiat-mining operations daily, but if you're going to go the crypto route might I recommend some stable coins as well that you can stake so at least you're not getting neutered by .01% interest rates in your savings accounts? That way, WHEN the market crashes (again I don't know when but at some point it will) you still have an emergency fund of stable coins that you can convert back to fiat to pay for expenses if needed.


Am I a soothsayer? No, I've been in Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017; I've seen my fair share of bull runs and crashes and EVERY single bull run EVERY discussion always devolve into ""THIS IS IT WE'RE GONNA BE RICH OFC MY INVESTMENTS ARE MOONING I'M AN INVESTMENT GOD"" followed by suicide hotline links.

31,CryptoCurrency,AbysmalScepter,Change my mind: The gaming community is actually right about NFTs in games,"Asset ownership is powerful, and on the surface, gaming and NFTs seem like a match made in heaven. Who wouldn't love to sell an item they spent hours collecting materials to craft?

But the reality is that even if you ""own"" an NFT, your ability to actually use your NFT is still ultimately at the discretion of the developer. Say you mint Sword of Slashing NFT #42069, but the developer determines you violated the TOS in some way - the could easily blacklist NFT #42069 and prevent it from being used in game. So while you may own the token, it's ultimately worthless - no one is going to want to buy an item that's blacklisted. 

The fact that in-game assets are not easily transferrable from a gameplay perspective makes ownership kind of moot as well. If you could still use NFT #42069 in another game, owning the token would be meaningful, but cross game-compatibility is not only difficult from a gameplay/design sense, it also doesn't really make that much sense economically - it would be difficult for developers to make money if you could just bring all your items from a completely unrelated game

This all isn't even touching on the current state of NFT games, which tend to be unfair and imbalanced at best and outright scams at worst.

*TLDR*: I feel ultimately, the challenge for NFT-based games is that the incentives don't really align. Ownership isn't true ownership because the devs still have the power to blacklist your NFTs. At the same time, creating an open platform around true asset ownership and cross-game compatibility probably makes little financial sense for game developers.",1634823198,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcrwz4/change_my_mind_the_gaming_community_is_actually/
36,CryptoCurrency,AggravatingString,NEAR Protocol Announces $350M Grants to Expand dApp Ecosystem,"[There was this announcement today I read on Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/a16z-backed-blockchain-gets-350-million-grants-vehicle-for-defi) about NEAR giving out $350 MILLION of grants and liquidity to applicants who want to create protocols in their ecosystem. It was interesting as it also mentioned a bunch of protocols I hadn’t come across before so I thought I’d do some research on them and figured I’d share what I found:

[REF Finance](https://app.ref.finance/)

REF I already knew and have a small bag. It’s NEAR’s premier blue chip DEX and runs on a central AMM just like Uniswap. The fact that transaction fees are between $0.001 and $0.002 NEAR obviously far outstrips Uniswap’s offering. Another feature is the fact multiple liquidity pools are in one contract which automatically chooses the cheapest route to enact a swap. These are two big upgrades on Uniswap already and means if NEAR continues its upward momentum I expect REF’s price to chase after it - just like Serum did when Solana crashed through the ceiling a few months back.

[Burrow Cash](https://twitter.com/burrowcash)

I think if you want to run smart contracts on the Cosmos network then Hyperledger Burrow is the answer. It’s native to NEAR, but as it can run as an EVM to integrate with Ethereum or use WASM to connect to Cosmos, it’s more flexible. Seems like a simple way for new enterprises to create the smart contracts it needs. 

[Onomy Protocol](https://onomy.io/)

This one I actually found the most interesting. Their medium is really well written, for one thing, which makes a pleasant change from some other projects I’ve seen and shows they’ve got a professional team already and they’re not messing about. It seems to be an institutional play to get the Forex market on-chain and all the benefits that it offers - fast finality, instant settlement yada yada. That’s a hell of a lot of money that might be flowing through Onomy Protocol before too long. They’re not launched yet but they’re doing a bonding curve offering which personally I’m in favour of - so this one I think is probably worth keeping an eye on.

[Trisolaris](https://medium.com/trisolaris-labs/trisolaris-is-near-6df2eb7f43ee)

I find this project both interesting and weird, and probably profitable. What Trisolaris has basically done is recreate the Ethereum experience, with fees paid in ETH and using products like Metamask, Wallet connect and Etherscan, but using the underlying NEAR layer 1 to offset all of Ethereum’s drawbacks. If NEAR keeps pumping, then I think it has the opportunity to hook users of the Ethereum mainnet as knowledge about NEAR grows.

I think all four of these native NEAR projects may blow up if NEAR continues its trend. What do you think? REF and Trisolaris are aiming to capture Ethereum’s market share - do you think they will? 

Official PR seems to be this:

47,CryptoCurrency,jgarcya,The 4yr cycle..... Right on schedule,"If you are new to crypto, and haven't heard of Bob Loukas.... Please go to YouTube and watch all his videos....

Start here with his first one made in late 2018(Dec?).

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWdOztDkv4

In this video.... Bob predicted the bottom of the bitcoin 4 yr cycle, almost to the day.... Remarkable!

I discovered this video in early 2019.... Started buying btc, ltc, eth...with every available dollar I had in March 2019.

I was homeless, but employed, but made just enough to cover bills( not rent)... Long story.

So at the time I could only throw $20/$40 a week at the ATM.... Thank you coinflip ATM.

And over the course of this period of time... My little bits of money put into crypto grew, and grew... Faster than I could keep up with it... Crypto took off so fast, I couldn't meet my crypto goals...

But I didn't give up... I kept DCA, whenever btc dropped 5-10%/30%/50%... Still haven't reached my goals in crypto...

Picked up doge in 2020 at .003.... Knowing it was going to jump someday.

But I had faith in the 4 yr cycle... Kept pushing through... Knowing that 2021 was the year of the bull run... And we saw 64k btc... 4k eth... 200+ltc... .64 doge...

I'm not homeless today, but am living with my mom now, after my dad passed away I moved back.

I've been hodlin ever since my start... Sold some doge thru r.h. for a quick grand, but that's it.

So here we are today.... The 4yr cycle is right on point... We are seeing new ATH, in the last quarter, and it's only Oct...

The last 4yr cycle peaked Dec. 17th(ish) 2017..... I expect this cycle to do the same, or possibly lengthen.

Here is the latest video between Bob loukas and Benjamin cowen discussing the possibility of the lengthening of the 4 yr cycle...

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RJcXNqyc_3k

Will it lengthen? Who knows?

If you hodl, it doesn't matter....

If you DCA, it may matter, so you can time your buys a bit, and try not to buy at all time highs...

If you trade, or wanna sell the top, and buy the bottom... These videos are a must watch!

I'm not sure how I'm planning my strategy... I'll figure that out in Dec... Or early 2022(if it lengthens)..

But I will say.... It is because of Bob loukas, and his awesome work he does on his videos.... It allowed me to stay focused, not sweat the dips, and have faith in the cycle...

And bc of this.... I have a 5 yr plan... And can actually see myself possibly retiring at 54...

From homeless to retirement in less than 10yrs would be incredible!

The goal is to raise money for The Economist Educational Foundation. The auction will start 5 pm BST on Monday 25th of October till 5pm BST Tuesday 26th of October.

The NFT is the cover of The Economist issue of the 18th of September. In this issue they dedicated a fairly large article to decentralised finance.

In my opinion the article was fairly basic and didn't cover the full potential of decentralised finance, crypto currency and NFTs. But I was pleased to see they are paying attention to it as there is a lot of money invested in this industry.

I'm happy to see The Economist is taking it a step further and getting somewhat involved themselves as well. I think this will help with, or at least is a sign of, general adoption. General adoption is probably also helped by the inflation of fiat currency.

67,CryptoCurrency,MrObviousTalks,NFTs Are a Scam (a rant),"I'm sick and tired of NFTs

Many people claim that crypto is the next dot com bubble. I do not believe this because its been 12 years and the crypto space has continued to grow. While its true there are many scams in the crypto space many coins have real and valuable use case. Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is a decentralized platform for dapps (decentralized apps) and smart contracts. This makes stuff like DeFi (decentralized finance) and even gaming possible. Indeed more and more amazing crypto technologies keep being developed that promise to revolutionize the world as we know it. 

**Then there are NFTs.**

Let me make myself clear: the vast majority of NFT projects are 100% useless and are complete cash grabs. Let me explain to you the absurdity of NFTs:

1. Pay an artist $10k to make an NFT character (like an ape) with tons of accessories that are randomized. (which vary in rarity)
2. Create a collection of '10,000 randomly generated NFTs', with a price floor of lets say 0.08 ETH. Now lets assume that you sold all 10k NFTs for JUST 0.08 ETH. Well guess what? You just got 800 ETH, which is worth **$3,363,240. T**his is even unrealistic because in most cases prices go up and you have NFT projects making TENS OF MILLIONS of dollars very easily.
3. Sit back and laugh as you rake in $100 million dollars.

**Most NFTs Will Be Worthless in the Longrun**

I think anyone who is honest with themselves knows that most NFTs will lose all their value in the next crypto bear market. Despite people saying 'its different this time' (its never different this time) Bitcoin will crash and the entire crypto market with it. On average Bitcoin has an 80% retracement and alts 95%. And lets consider the following statistic: *80% of alts never recover from this.*

People are making big money flipping NFTs like CryptoPunks or Bored Ape Club but what happens to their value in the next crash? Do people really believe they won't lose value? Of course they will. Something may still cost 100 ETH, but 100 ETH will be worth 80-90% less. The fact of the matter is there are some people spending 60 million dollars on NFTs. (beeple nft sold this much at auction)

**NFTs are 100% the real dot com bubble**

Ultimately crypto is here to stay. There will never be a 'dot com crash' for bitcoin. On the other hand I believe that when the NFT bubble pops it will absolutely decimate NFTs for many years to come.  This is scary because I expect a lot of people to lose everything and we may have some very sad stories come out in this time. When it comes to the NFT bubble popping it's not a question of if but when.

Very few projects will stand the test of time and I have a feeling the next bear market is going to be a massive wake up call to people in peak NFT euphoria.

**NFTs Main Usecase is Money Laundering**

Let me tell you how absurdly easy it is to artificially pump the price of an NFT.

1. Buy/Mint an NFT for 0.08 and sell it on your opensea account.
2. Create a different opensea account with a different name.
3. Spend 1 ETH to buy your own NFT, since you own both wallets you lose no money.
4. Rinse repeat.

You can basically pump the price of an NFT with your own ETH, if you're lucky some sucker makes an offer and buys it from you. You basically lost no money outside of gas fees. But even if you DON'T get an offer, you can now take your NFT worth '30 ETH' and put it into a DeFi lending platform as collateral. Because it sold for '30 ETH' (to yourself) you can get an NFT backed loan on an NFT that in reality is actually worthless. Default on the loan and they take your NFT and you make 30 ETH. Wow.

You can also just use NFTs to launder money like the rich use modern art.

**Conclusion**

Anybody can create a 10k NFT Project these days. You just need an artist, twitter/discord and good marketing. Its not hard at all and most of these projects just have no real value outside of money laundering or people trading NFTs to themselves to artificially inflate the price. Most NFTs are absolutely worthless for anything more than bragging rights. Literally the only reaosn anyone buys NFTs is because they think they will inflate in value, this is unsustainable.

Don't get me wrong, I think NFTs have real use cases, and they can be used in art too, but the prices are currently complete nonsense. A digital jpeg is not worth millions of dollars sorry. That is just not living in the real world.

**Many people's lives will be destroyed when the NFT bubble pops.**

The CEO of the real estate firm that helps people buy and co-own a second home, Austin Allison, says the firm has seen increased crypto adoption “across the real estate industry.”

Real Estate Platform Pacaso Now Supports Crypto Payments

The firm Pacaso is a real estate platform co-founded by Spencer Rascoff and Austin Allison. Rascoff is well known for co-founding Zillow Group and co-founding Hotwire.com as well. In October 2020, Rascoff co-founded Pacaso with Allison, and the company is considered a real estate platform that makes owning a second home easier by leveraging shared ownership. Pacaso’s business model is similar to the timeshare model but it’s also a touch different.

“Forget timeshares, with Pacaso, you own a home, not just a block of time,” the company’s website details. “You can book stays throughout the year, not annually. And resale? It’s fast and streamlined, and you set the price.” Now the firm has decided to accept crypto assets via the Atlanta-based digital currency payment platform Bitpay.
“Digital currencies and the blockchains that power them are seeing increased adoption across the real estate industry, and a crypto payment option is a recurring topic in our conversations with prospective buyers of second homes,” said Austin Allison, Pacaso’s co-founder and CEO. “As we expand internationally and put second-home co-ownership within reach for more people across the globe, we’re thrilled to be able to respond to that demand and extend as many payment options as we can to our customers.”",1634822202,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcrlev/real_estate_platform_pacaso_accepts_crypto_assets/
71,CryptoCurrency,Misesofficial,How decentralized social media deals with illegal content - example of Mises," How does decentralized social media deal with illegal content? The principle of Mises is to delegate the power of content reviewing to nodes. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0x75gvk10tu71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a37ff4b66802dcc5887e0eca207095f6851289b5)

Every country has laws against illegal content. However, the laws of different countries are different. Illegal content in one country may be OK in another one. Since different nodes are under different jurisdictions and they must compromise to different regulations, Mises’ team decided to give the power of reviewing content to nodes. The node can review the content stored on it. For content that violates local laws, the node can mark it as illegal and refuse to host the content. Since the user’s content is stored in a decentralized network, the content is not only stored in one node, and other nodes may not necessarily reject the content, so the content can still be accessed unless all nodes in the Mises network refuse to host it. If the node refuses to host, it cannot obtain the storage fee from the user. On the other hand, the user can pay to start a DAO arbitration. If the DAO judges that the node rejects the user content without a valid reason, the node should compensate the user, and the qualification of this node will eventually be terminated.

In the 2002 Kazaa case, the judge cited the photocopier as an example. The photocopier can be used to copy documents in the office and can also be used to pirate books. When the photocopier is used for pirating, the owner of the photocopier is responsible, not the manufacturer of the photocopier. As a decentralized project, Mises cannot control or limit the content from users. This ability and responsibility are delegated by the node.",1634822154,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcrkvg/how_decentralized_social_media_deals_with_illegal/

I told him that he should make an account in a exchange and I recommended him Kraken, as that is what I use. I did tell him the advantages / disadvantages of keeping his assets in an exchange and we decide that it’s better for now for him to leave it in the exchange.

I also introduced him to other cryptos. It’s so nice finally having a real life friend to talk about crypto with.

Any tips I should give him on behalf of this sub?

[EXPERIMENT - Tracking Top 10 Cryptos Of 2020 - Month Twenty-One – UP 731&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/j9g1n8ofwsu71.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05cc0092811113ff595012da78af1e7e8e0864b4)

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-20)***.***

Welcome to the monthly recap for the 3rd of 4 homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. The 2020 Portfolio is made up of: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, BitcoinSV,** and **Tezos.**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **Top Performer of September** \- For the second month in a row, **Tezos (+23%)**
* **Overall since Jan. 2020** \- **BNB** leads, up **+2,871%** in 21 months, the best performing of any of the cryptos in any of the four Top Ten Experiments. Last place is **BSV** \+40%.
* An ode to DCA: **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +405%.**

## Month Twenty-One – UP 731%

https://preview.redd.it/n8lle9b6xsu71.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b11c162667fd3e910fb3c09c841e02cff0761020

The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, BCH, Litecoin, EOS, BNB, BSV,** and **Tezos**.  

September highlights for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* For the second month in a row, **Tezos** runs away with the monthly victory and saves the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio from a dreaded all-red month.  
* **BNB** maintains overall lead, but second place **Ethereum** gain a lot of ground in September.
* The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portolio is the best performing of all four Top Ten Experiments.

This group of cryptos also highlights the benefits of an index fund strategy: the **+731%** return of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio has *outperformed eight of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index.* Only by guessing right and throwing all your eggs into **Ethereum** and/or **Binance Coin** would you have performed better than spreading out the risk, index style.  

## September Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

As was the case [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-20), only **XTZ** climbed in rank in September. The other cryptos maintained their positions or slid downward.

Ups:

* **Tezos** – up 4 places (#34–&gt;#30)

Downs:

* **BSV** – down 8 places (#46–#54)
* **EOS** – down 7 places (#33–&gt;#40)
* **Bitcoin Cash** – down 4 places (#14–&gt;#18)

https://preview.redd.it/36fxev19xsu71.png?width=406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7c9053ba4efb67d455a708a14edac85c4212ce3

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after twenty-one months, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash** have been replaced by **Cardano,** **Polkadot, Solana, Doge,** and **USDC.**

**BSV** has now dropped out of the Top *Fifty.*

## September Winners and Losers 

***September Winners*** – Only **Tezos** (+23%) finished the month in positive territory.

***September Losers*** –   **EOS** (-20%) had the worst month followed by **Bitcoin Cash** (-19%).

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After twenty-one months, here’s a snapshot of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment’s monthly winners and losers: 

https://preview.redd.it/w5gpz77axsu71.jpg?width=412&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5709727fe72706b0f83105a49be01f3bde4272d

With five monthly victories, **ETH** leads the pack and **Tezos** has the second most monthly victories.  **Tether** still has the most monthly losses, a good sign for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio.

## Overall Update – BNB still in lead, ETH second place.  100% of cryptos in positive territory, 2020 Top Ten best performing of the four Experiments

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the four [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 100% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive territory, most have at least *triple digit price growth.* Two have *four digit growth* (**BNB** and **ETH**).  **Binance Coin** continues to hold a commanding lead, but second place **Ethereum** gained some ground in September.

The initial $100 investment twenty-one months ago into first place **Binance Coin**? Currently worth **$2,972**, an increase of +2,871%.    

In second is **Ethereum,** also with quadruple digit gains, up +2,454%.

Besides **USDT**, the worst performer in the 2020 group is **BSV,** up +40% since January 2020.  Anyone skilled in DeFi could have returned much more than +40% using **stablecoins like Tether** fairly easily over the last couple of years. 

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/n8g4jzvbxsu71.png?width=499&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3da7bc7a11f7cd9f9ed2f92b7e0f1de42dab3fd

The total crypto market lost about $108B in September, settling at just over $2.1T.  As a sector, crypto is up **+1015%** over the twenty-one month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+1015%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+731%) and ridiculously better than the S&amp;P (+35%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&amp;P below.

The Top Ten index fund strategy has done pretty well up to this point in the experiment: it has outperformed eight of the ten individual cryptos held within the index.  Only by guessing correctly on **ETH** or **BNB** would you have beaten the Top Ten approach.   

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$185B in March 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.22T** [**last month**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-20).

## Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/bnay4u0dxsu71.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28f601796a08cee91e660a439486bab91eaa46c6

**BitDom** bounced slightly in September, up to 43.2% compared to 42% in August.  This is the low end of the range when looking at the timeframe as a whole. 

For context, here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination over the twenty-one month life of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**41.9% in May 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/1y20irydxsu71.png?width=355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90605c4357dd374097b2dada3b5f6dc3783617d4

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio picked up $1,162 in September and is now worth **$8,309** (+731%) from the initial $1k investment.  For some context, the all time high of the 2020  Top Ten Portfolio was **$10,5236** just [five months ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16)). 

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the four Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

https://preview.redd.it/r4do6lxexsu71.png?width=469&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8cc2438ecdd7d691c5cec386dbd983e6b00661

The portfolio has yet to experience a red month, although a little over a year ago in [March 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/) it came close, returning a COVID induced low of +7%.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +46% (total value $1,460)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33): up +510% (total value $6,098)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21): up +731% (total value $8,309)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9): up +333% (total value $4,330)

Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,197** ($1,460 + $6,098 + $8,309 + $4,330).

**That’s up +405%** on the combined portfolios.

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/aar2wpihxsu71.jpg?width=514&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48efd2063f4384e9b27ea92f1dc8a0f1289db59c

***That’s a +405% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for four straight years***. 

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.   For the first time in nearly a year, the S&amp;P 500 did not reach a month end all time high in September:

https://preview.redd.it/uml8r54jxsu71.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=298b07df0c4957fd292cb8f06d142f2e99298cac

Since it has returned +35% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1350 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+731%**, worth **$$8,309**.

***That’s a difference of $6,959.***  

***On a $1k investment!*** 

But that’s just 2020. What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,630 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,740 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,350 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,160 today

So, taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,880** ($1,630 + $1,740 + $1,350 + $1,160)

That is up **+47%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+405%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 358% ***in favor of crypto.***

To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined four year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;P up to this point.

https://preview.redd.it/6an6c00lxsu71.jpg?width=598&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fc7481ae178608c4d55c800f4bd8d3a47b92ee3

## Conclusion:

After bouncing back from a three month losing streak in August, the 2020 Top Ten portfolio slid down once again.  With the first three quarters in the rear view mirror, what does traditionally strong Q4 have in store for crypto?

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride!

18,CryptoCurrency,ObsoleteGentile,The people posting to encourage unknown internet strangers to sell…are simple-minded dumbfucks,"The people posting to encourage unknown internet strangers to sell…are simple-minded dumbfucks

First off, I’m not about diamond-handsing no matter what, see-you-in-hell-boys wallstreetbets dipshittery. That’s just dumb. There are a couple of legit reasons to sell some crypto now.

Did you invest overzealously, and get yourself in trouble? More than you could afford to lose comfortably? Then sure, now might be a good time to back partially out of a precarious position and reset for a future where you’ll be more careful. No shame in making mistakes if you learn from them and correct course.

Or maybe you are wealthy enough from other sources, and crypto is purely for speculative fun. If that’s you, congrats, and by all means carry on.

But most of us are here to build future wealth, and advance the date we can retire happily. In that case, regular or mindless profit-taking simply doesn’t make sense. If you are responsibly invested and your portfolio is performing well, then converting any part of it to fiat is a guaranteed recipe for future regret. You might as well buy premium, dry-aged ribeye and then take a shit on it before eating it.

Take a step back. Reassess your portfolio, and your confidence in it. If there’s something that’s gained, but maybe looks less promising than it did when you bought it, consider selling it, but only to turn it into the coins in which your confidence hasn’t wavered, or is perhaps even growing. 

Reassess. Re-evaluate. Re-balance if necessary. But if you’re not overextended, and your crypto is pumping on progress, development, partnerships and other fundamentals, then HODL on.",1634821233,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcr9mw/the_people_posting_to_encourage_unknown_internet/
23,CryptoCurrency,Hodor_The_HODLer,Finally green again - should I stay or should I go?,"I jumped into crypto this year after the May drop because of the buying opportunity. I DCA’d into my top holdings of BTC ETH, ADA, ALGO, DOT, and LINK and I’m very satisfied with the long term viability of these projects so I will certainly HODL and probably add to my painting.

I’ve put some small amounts into high risk/high potential projects that are very new with small market caps and I know some will go to zero but hopefully one will moon. 

I’m having an internal struggle on what to do with two of my holdings - VET and AMP…

VET
PROs: I bought in because of the pilot program with Wal-Mart in China and because supply chain is an area ripe for blockchain improvements. 

CONs: Now China is hostile towards crypto, other logistics companies have shown that the token approach with VET isn’t necessary, and VET is very centralized. 

VET has been out since 2018 and did nothing price wise until this year when it moved with the overall market.

AMP
PROs: Flexa’s integration with existing payment rails is a killer early-mover advantage IMO, it is already deployed at major retailers.

CONs: High gas fees make it expensive to move or stake/unstake. AMP price hasn’t moved up with positive news about AMP/Flexa and it continues to set new lower lows. Low visibility from the devs and minimal marketing.

I know AMP is a utility token and not as flashy as many other projects but it seems like the team is letting a prime opportunity slip away to increase visibility and adoption.

For both of these my question is do I stick with them longer or move my funds to other projects that may be better opportunities?",1634821035,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcr79g/finally_green_again_should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/
24,CryptoCurrency,waltershakes,The importance of the daily trading volume of a coin,"Everyone talks about the market cap of a coin as a very important parameter in understanding its value.

Then again, some say market cap is not so indicative, as it is only a theoretical parameter: how much the circulating coins are worth at the price of the moment. It doesn't mean people are actually wanting to buy or sell a lot that coin, because a whale can manipulate the price 
and there, a shitcoin has a huge marketcap.

I believe the daily trading volume can be also an useful instrument, even if it can also be manipulated big time, especially by exchanges, as it is discussed in this article:


https://www.investopedia.com/news/are-cryptos-high-trading-volumes-scam/

Welcome to **Round 29 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 29: A term used to describe someone who has acquired 1% of 1% (0.01%) of the maximum supply of a cryptocurrency. 

The correct answer of **Round 28** is...

Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...

# InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)!

**What is** **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS):**

InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is an open-source project that is building a peer-to-peer file system. The IPFS project is an ambitious project that can potentially change the way we use the Internet. Its final goal is to connect all devices that have the same file system, but not in the same way the Web does today. In order to understand the basics of IPFS, it’s helpful to compare it with HTTP.

Essentially, the current World Wide Web is based on the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. In short, these are application protocols that enable worldwide data communication and accessibility. 

HTTP works as a request-response protocol that connects users (clients) to servers, based on their location. For instance, if Alice goes to a website, her web browser will request the content to the hosting server (e.g., Amazon Web Services). If all goes well, the AWS server will then return the web pages to her. 

However, the content is not permanent because it is maintained by a centralized server. And since the AWS is hosting a large number of websites, if their servers go down for any reason, a big percentage of the Internet goes down with it.

In contrast, IPFS allows for the creation of a permanent and distributed Web, where all sorts of digital data can be stored and shared. While HTTP communications rely on a server (with a specific location) to provide the content, IPFS communications focus on the content itself.

With IPFS, Alice would no longer ask the content directly to the AWS server. Instead, she would ask the distributed network “who can provide me this content?” and the closest peers would quickly respond.

Depending on the implementation, IPFS may present many advantages when compared to HTTP, such as censorship resistance, data integrity, lower operational costs, better performance, and security.

Some of the limitations are related to the low incentives to participate in the network, which leads to a small population of peers. The limited adoption makes it harder for files to be permanently available. If certain data is only hosted by a handful of nodes and all go offline, it will become inaccessible.

32,CryptoCurrency,rootpl,Money Flow in Crypto,"If you are worried that your coins aren't pumping right now please be patient and wait. Usually bull runs have mid-cycles as well where coins move between different market caps. It always start with FIAT or stablecoins, money usually flows to Bitcoin, from there, people start taking profits and moving them to other coins, usually large caps like Ethereum or ADA. Once pump on those is over they move to mid caps, think the top 50 etc. after that money starts flowing towards low caps. It happens sometimes multiple times during one large bull run cycle.

Be patient, relax, don't chase pumps, you'll be fine. The circle will repeat itself again and again.

38,CryptoCurrency,Pma2kdota,Reminder that HODL is a meme,"Memes are funny. Memes are informative. Memes trigger some and bring joy to others.

But most importantly, memes drive culture.

So how do memes impact finance and crypto culture? Take a look over at cryptomoonshots for some degeneracy or wallstreebets for loss porn. Do you want your portfolio to look like that? Well it can, if you HODL for too long.

The word ""HODL"" is an abbreviation of holding on for dear life. How does this apply to crypto? Because we fill our bags with coins and when they are not profitable they become heavy, and hard to hold. So you HODL! You may also imagine being a fuzzy little bear holding and freezing your butt off during a crypto winter, hodl-ing your berries. This certainly helps new investors look at the long term prospects of crypto rather than panic selling at a loss and leaving the space entirely.

However, once sentiment starts to change, the people who scream ""don't sell"" and ""HODL"" the loudest might not have *your* best interests in mind. Did you see their portfolios? Maybe they threw some beer money at a coin and are trolling. Maybe they put in their life savings are are starting to panic, thinking their comment will move the market. Maybe they have a good chunk of cash ready to DCA and don't care at all about price. 

But I certainly don't want to hodl, and why should you? It implies being uncomfortable with your investment. And if you're uncomfortable with your investment, you don't make great decisions. Panic selling will cost you. Holding can be a form of indecision. That paralyzing feeling of getting out too early and missing out on future gains, or only watching the numbers in your portfolio change and the charts move while you do... nothing.

So am i telling you to sell? To buy more? Recently I heard on a podcast that Americans have trouble with black and white issues. No, not race, I mean **grey areas**. Things like gun laws, abortion, immigration. ""All or nothing"", ""Yes or no"". Life ain't like that. There are grey areas.

And I just wanted to let you know: It's ok to swipe your finger on the top of the cake for a taste without devouring it in one sitting.

That way, you can always have money to buy back higher ;)",1634820434,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcr0b0/reminder_that_hodl_is_a_meme/

* 12,500 Saigon Green Beers

* Food for 23,1 years (Ramen x3 per day)

* 20 Scooters (The most popular vehicle in VN).

* 10,000 Bánh mì or Vietnamese Ice Coffee

44,CryptoCurrency,No_Weather682,Crypto Exit Strategy: When to take profits (Must Read For Beginners),"# What is an exit strategy?

An exit strategy is a plan with the intentions of selling your cryptocurrencies once a predetermined criteria have been met. The main goal is to maximize profits while minimizing losses.

# Why you need an exit strategy?

As we all know, crypto prices are utterly volatile. This makes trying to sell at the peak price extremely risky (do yourself a favor: stop trying to get out at the top), since you could miss it and end up selling at a loss. That’s why we make exit strategies, to maximize profits while minimizing losses.

# What are your goals?

First think to contemplate is what are your goals. These are personal questions that everyone must consider when investing: 

* How much are you willing to hodl for the long term (+5 years)? And how much are you hodling only for the short term?
* How much profit is your main goal? (In % or $)
* How much risk are you willing to take?
* What is your realistic price target?

You will not know what exit strategy works better for you until you have tried a couple, since everyone has different goals. Thus, these are the best and most common crypto exit strategies for beginners that you can try out:

# Selling at price targets

This is the most commonly used exit strategy. Here you target a price for your investment and sell your asset when the prices reach that range. This tactic may seem simple, but will eventually lead to better results instead of trying to time the market. For example, if you own 1 ETH instead of selling your whole ETH at $10K, divide it up into 5 different sections and sell them at different prices:

1. Sell 0.2 ETH at $8K
2. Sell 0.2 ETH at $9K
3. Sell 0.2 ETH at $10K
4. Sell 0.2 ETH at $11K
5. Sell 0.2 ETH at $12K

This way you’re taking profits along the way, and if the Markets dips you would have secured some profits. The example above is a simple one and not financial advice, I recommend you to DYOR and deep studies before setting realistic price targets. 

# Playing with house money

One common exit strategy is selling what you initially invested when you’re up 2x,3x or even more. With this plan you can take more risk when you sell your initial investment, since if you lose everything, it would be house money. However, for some people securing only 2x/3x/5x is a small amount in the crypto space.

# Dollar-Cost-Average out (DCA)

Probably the most mentioned exit strategy in this subreddit. This strategy is particularly designed for safe investment. In the dollar cost averaging method, you divide your portfolio and periodically sell your assets between a regular interval. This strategy can prevent becoming too greedy, or selling too late, while still taking profits from time to time. Many people keep 5-10% of their holdings just in case we are in a super-cycle.

For example, if you think that this bull run will peak in 31 of January, start selling 10% of your portfolio 10 weeks before, selling 10% every week until you sell all your portfolio. Or you can sell 5% every single day, starting 20 days before. Just pick what percentage suits better for you and when to sell it (every day/week/month).

I hope this post was useful to those new in the crypto space. As always, the examples above are not financial advice, DYOR and feel free to share your exit strategies so we can all learn together.",1634820172,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcqxc6/crypto_exit_strategy_when_to_take_profits_must/

59,CryptoCurrency,DanielSavge,I’m having a huge hard on for Solana and safemoon right now.,"give me the downvotes, but Solana will overtake ETH, and Safemoon will overtake BNB in 2023. Bitcoin will remain on top even though it has less utility than a lot of newer gen coins, but Solana will overtake ETH because its blockchain provides much cheaper fees, and it’s more efficient. Plus, apps created on its ecosystem are much more scalable. In the longterm, as crypto continues to integrate into more technologies and countries issues like cheaper fees, scalability, and speed will be more important than ever because their will be a daily use. ETH is not nearly as practical for daily transactional uses as Solana or even XRP. But yes, as said initially safemoon will overtake BNB, and many of you are probably scoffing at that idea and ready to call me a lunatic. The fact that I will be called a madman shows a lot of traders will let these influencers and gurus shove BS down their throat that pushes them away from doing their own research in the first place. I just urge those of you who are reluctant to tell me a genuine reason why they doubt safemoon, I just want one genuine, well thought out question and I promise I can change your mind with facts. let me help you see what I see. There is a dedicated community of over 270k users Reddit users, and over a million Twitter followers that will support and purchase every product safemoon release in the future, and trust me there will be many products.",1634819875,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qcqtxh/im_having_a_huge_hard_on_for_solana_and_safemoon/

68,CryptoCurrency,antonito901,Most likely BTC price is going to have a correction,"Everyone knows it. If you don't, you make a fool of yourself. Even though the short-term market sentiment is very bullish, it wouldn't be abnormal to see a temporary correction. Actually it is pretty healthy. It is ok. When an asset is overbought, it may be headed for a change in trend. This is nothing new for crypto being her for a while. It can not go up in a straight line forever. This is not how it works.

* When? No one knows (don't listen to people who say they can time the market)
* How low? You never know but a drop to around $53,000 would seem fair

For newcomers, remember this is normal, just relax and let the time to do his work. Think of it like people who decided to take their gain and get off the Bitcoin train.

72,CryptoCurrency,_DeanRiding,Unpopular opinion: I like Coinbase,"For a few reasons. Mostly because it's simple and easy to use.

I can find the bar graphs quite distracting when I'm trying to look at the price action on a particular coin over a length of time, and Coinbase allows me to see an incredibly simple line graph with no faffing around.

Additionally, Coinbase is the only exchange I know of that allows me to purchase every single asset they have with my native currency: GBP. That means I know exactly how much I have at any one time for any particular asset, without having to faff around with currency conversions, or alternatively buying BTC (or Tether) and swapping it for the token I actually want. I like being able to just directly buy the asset I want.

Also, I don't know if any other exchanges do this, but despite Coinbase's high initial fees, once you have you money in there you can convert it to any other coin at any time completely free of charge. That means you can daytrade without being hit by massive fees as you can simply convert the coin you're holding into a stablecoin (DAI is my favourite as it gives 2% staking) until you're ready to move it into another asset.

Lastly, as far as I know, Coinbase is the only exchange (in the UK) that offers any sort of protection if you are hacked or scammed. They will refund your account with up to £150,000 if this happens, so the mantra, 'not your keys not your coins' loses some of its punch. On this point as well, as far as I'm aware, Coinbase is yet to list an asset that is an outright scam (notwithstanding the potential for Tether/SHIB).

78,CryptoCurrency,gmophree,Crypto Trading with multiple Nationalities?,"So I am lucky enough to have documents and and rights to choose residency in either the USA, Greece, or Germany. Maybe even Spain and a few other European countries if I wanted to, as I have the ability to live/work remote and have many family member's houses where I can stay semi-long term and claim residency.

As of writing this post:

* Germany taxes an individual's crypto gains at 25% unless you hodl for 1+ year, then it is 0%.
* Greece taxes an individual's crypto gains at 15% regardless of hodl or not, but allows to claim previous losses.
* USA taxes 0% for up to $40k in gains if you hodl for 1+ year, but up to 20% for more, and even more in some states like California or New York. Also, the new Biden plan may increase those taxes and oversight very soon.

Anyone have any idea on what is the best option for someone like me, as far as registering residency on various exchanges? I should also mention that my fiat currency is mostly USD made with clean traceable US income and is deposited in a US bank account.

Binance and other apps allow me to setup EU resident accounts, and I can transfer from a US account via Swift or Skrill. However, I believe that if I file taxes in the US for US income, even if I am registered as resident of another country on one of these exchanges or wallets, I can still be subject to US capital gains tax regardless. Claiming multiple residencies may hurt me if I have to pay taxes in another country AND THEN again in the US. Do you think it is just easier with US based USD to just trade using American residency and just deal with the potential coming taxes and oversight?
