13,investing,EselSchwanz,Inherited large amount of equity.. Not sure whether to liquidate and invest now or wait,"I'm 25 years old and just inherited a portion of the family company which sums up to about $950k, and I have a buyer at any time if I were to decide to liquidate. This started paying about $1800/month this year, which is a lot to me but less than 2.5% of the total amount. This is a crazy, game changing opportunity for me to reinvest into something that will grow my wealth as well as pay enough monthly to live off of and pursue interests/ventures even if I only make a 5% cap, but I'm really wary to do so now.

The company is currently growing and I have no idea what I'd invest in to begin with and I'm afraid of two things: 1. Never liquidating and regretting it because of the potential 2. Making bad investments and losing everything. 3. The company doubling in size and losing out on having doubled equity with no effort within the next few years

The thing is, though, that $950k is more than enough for me, and I'm young. I could pursue business interests, invest in something to pour my time/energy into, move anywhere. I'm just wary on what to do and I'm a little overwhelmed. Any advice?",1635167216,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qfgc31/inherited_large_amount_of_equity_not_sure_whether/

35,investing,Worried_individual_,Advice on investing and why people overcomplicate it?,"Hi guys I'm a 19 year old kid and I've invested into Tesla, so far I got return of around $900 and the number increases everyday.

Why do people overcomplicate it and make it seem like it's more than it is? For me it's as simple as selling high and buying low I've made some minor mistakes but right now I'm pretty confident in it. I don't really do any research on the company and it may seem arrogant but it is what it is.

Whenever I tried learning more it's full of people who think they're the shit or a bunch of gibberish, ""you will lose money"", ""this is gambling"" ""you're young spend it somewhere else"" 

So what exactly is stock trading in simple terms, how do I know when to buy and when to sell, what sort of things should I look at? I seen on twitter loads of people that made some right calls early on a stock that became big the next day, how do I become one of em?

48,investing,somalley3,"Young adult, best to build wealth in a house or rent","22 (m) working in finance, i currently split rent in a one bedroom with serious girl friend, and i’ve spent some time reflecting recently on how inclined i am to actually buy a house in the intermediate term. I’m less looking for advice on personal finance because i know there are better subreddits on that, but I wanted to raise conversation and see others’ insights on using a single family house as a practical vehicle for growing wealth in house equity. I’m familiar with the pros and cons of renting vs owning a home and i’ve read Rich Dad Poor Dad so no need to remind me that a home for many is actually a liability, i’m more thinking about let’s say the next 5-7 years whether it makes more sense to rent over an extended period of time and plow more money into equities or to build equity in a home by getting a mortgage. I know there’s lots of nuances to this and i consider myself to be a knowledgeable and reasonably sophisticated investor (at least with my own money) so i don’t need tips on how to allocate the difference necessarily, but the crux of my question boils down to over an intermediate 5-7 ish year time frame whether it’s more effective to build wealth generally in a diversified equities portfolio with increased marginal contributions rather than saving up for a downpayment on a house while continuing to rent, or save up for a down payment and use leverage from a mortgage to build real estate equity. Note, not looking for a house to ‘settle down’ in long term because i recognize the right house for a family has qualitative values not measurable or relevant to an investment analysis. Speaking purely from an investment stand point, i’m wondering whether a leveraged real estate investment (which is how i would think of a house if i bought one now) and all the costs associated as well as the equity in a booming real estate market compares with expected equity returns in medium term. part of my concern here is that neither stocks nor housing seem cheap, especially not in my area right now, but buying a house requires using leverage to enter a record hot asset class while continuing to rent and pouring more into stocks (in roth accounts and then taxable) feels like a more moderate decision.

73,investing,FearlessNL,$SID - An integrated steel company that is criminally undervalued (169% upside),"# Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional S.A. Analysis (Ticker: SID)

*An integrated steel company that is criminally undervalued*

# A general understanding of the business.

Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional is a Brazilian corporation incorporated in 1941. The Presidente Vargas Steelworks, located in the city of Volta Redonda, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, began its production of coke, pig iron and steel products in 1946, when they also incorporated the Casa de Pedra mine, located in the city of Congonhas, state of Minas Gerais, and the Arcos mine, located in the city of Arcos, state of Minas Gerais. The Casa de Pedra mine assures self-sufficiency in iron ore and the Arcos mine provides limestone and dolomite.

CSN was privatized through a series of auctions held in 1993 and early 1994, through which the Brazilian government sold its 91% ownership interest. The company began trading on the NYSE in 1997. It has a market cap of \~$6.1B with a share price of $4.46 at the time of writing.

*Current operations*

CSN is currently one of the largest integrated steel producers in Latin America in terms of crude steel production, they produced 11.3% of Brazil’s total crude steel production in 2020. They operate throughout the entire steel production chain, meaning they do everything from mining the ore to the sale of steel products. Their business can be separated in five segments: steel, mining, cement, logistics and energy.

*Steel*

CSN’s current annual crude steel capacity at their main facility is about 5.6 million tons. With an additional production capacity of 1.1 million tons of steel at their long steel segment in Germany. They obtain all their iron ore (and other products) from their own mines.

*Mining activities*

As previously mentioned, CSN obtains all their iron ore from their own mines. However, they sold 29.6 million tons, 34.9 million tons and 26.9 million tons of iron ore to third parties in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Their mines are strategically located within Brazil’s “Iron Ore Quadrangle” within the state of Minas Gerais.

*Logistics*

CSN holds stakes in and operates many business that operate in transportation of goods. They operate a port terminal for containers, called TECON. They also have participation in 3 railways.

*Cement*

CSN entered the cement industry in 2009 to take advantage of the synergy potential with their steelmaking business. They have gradually invested in their cement segment, with the most recent being the acquisition of the Brazilian business of LafargeHolcim for $1 billion. They also acquired Elizabeth Cimentos for a value of $214 million in July of this year.

*Electricity*

Steelmaking requires significant amounts of electricity to power rolling mills, production lines, hot metal processing, coking plants, cryogenic plant and auxiliary units. They produce most of the electricity from a power-plant at their main facility which secures them about 235 MW of capacity. In addition, they secure on average 188 MW through various equity interests.

# Valuation &amp; Growth

CSN isn’t a fancy EV company with revenue growing 1000% YOY, however they are growing fast compared to peers. Their earnings per share (EPS) has grown at an annual 38.3% over the past 5 years. They are also investing profits back into their own business through acquisitions. The insiders of this company are focused on growing the company considering they have a 54.5% stake.

Some statistics about the valuation of CSN:

P/E: 2.26  
P/Free Cash Flow: 2.68  
PEG: 0.58  
Return On Equity: 117.7%  
Return On Assets: 22.3%  
Return On Investment: 11.1%

This company has a price to free cash flow of 2.68. Which means with no growth at all it will have made its own market cap in profits in a little more than 2,5 years. They are also investing back heavily into their own business.

The average company in the steel-making industry has a P/E of 5.88, even though this isn’t a full-on steel company it is still noteworthy that it is trading at a P/E that is nearly 3 times lower than their main industry average. If we would value CSN at a P/E of 5.88 we would obtain a price of $11.88 indicating an increase of over 166%.

The estimated CAGR of the steel industry in the next 5 years is 4%, if we do a simple DCF analysis, with the assumptions of 4% growth over the next 5 years and a 2% growth rate in the years after, we get a fair enterprise value of $22.9B, compared to the current EV of $8.48B. This would also indicate a share price of around $12.00 (specifically $12.04).

The stock of CSN ($SID) has been more than cut in half in the recent months. This creates a wonderful buying opportunity for investors looking for value and growth. If you are interested in this company I would encourage you to read the 20-F (10-K for foreign companies) for yourself and decide if this is a good investment. After all I am just an individual and not a hedge fund, have fun investing!

For those of you not familiar, Metamaterials uplisted to the Nasdaq by merging with Torchlight. I don't think it was random. I think it was because they had much bigger plans for the Orogrande Project that Torchlight had been trying to sell for almost a decade. Not to mention that thanks to new technology the Permian Basin (Which is where the Orogrande project is located) has now become a major source of oil. 

 **What is the Permian oil basin?**The Permian Basin is **the largest petroleum-producing basin in the United States** and has produced a cumulative 28.9 billion barrels of oil and 75 trillion cubic feet of gas. Currently in early 2020, over 4 million barrels of oil a day are being pumped from the basin.

I know the current MC is high based on the fundamentals, but this is a company that can't be compared to any others because it's the first one of it's kind to be listed on the Nasdaq. They are opening up a 68,000 sq ft warehouse q1 of next year. They acquired nanotech which will be able to produce 15 Million square meters of Nanoweb a year which retails for $300-$450 a square meter. Which will generate conservatively $500,000,000 a year in profit starting next year. They currently have 66 employees who are all extremely talented and are not volunteering. Many came from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and UCL. Most having PHDs and at least 2 who worked for Google prior to Meta. Obviously they are expanding, and rapidly based on this:

93,investing,auser24,Are there any asset classes from which one could expect positive real returns in a scenario of rising rates to contain inflation?,"Let's say the FED starts rising rates to contain inflation at some point in the future, which would hurt stocks. If this happens I want to have some exposure to asset classes that would benefit from an increase in rates. What would be the best options for this? Bonds are the first thing that comes to mind, but I can see some drawbacks, specially if we're talking about an inflationary scenario:

- Even with a rise in rates, nominal yields will likely stay below inflation on treasury bonds, yielding negative real returns. I don't see the FED rising rates to 3%+ anytime in the near future.
- I would have to hold the bond until maturity, selling it would be bad if rates keep rising because price is inversely correlated to yield. 

Are these assumptions correct? If so, are there better alternatives? TIPS does not sound like an alternative, its yield being bond yield minus inflation, so if bonds are below inflation so will TIPS (which is the current scenario, TIPS having negative yield). Gold price is inversely correlated to yields so it's a no-go. Crypto is high risk and I expect it would behave like so, with prices also falling, though it's hard to say. Are 1-2y bonds or CDs the best option here if I don't want to hold bonds for 10y?

Hey all, 

first off as a disclaimer there are never any guarantees with things like this. It may well turn out to be a Ponzi scheme and there are always risks which is why you should always take profit along the way and never spend more then what you can afford to lose. In saying that however I have personally made money out of this and short term (over the next year or so), I think this is a great little passive income earner. 

The site is called Upistic. You deposit crypto and it is locked in for a 20 day period. The deposited amounts are then used by Upistic’s own traders to trade Defi tokens in currency exchanges providing daily profits back to the initial investors (you). Depending how the traders perform each day you are guaranteed 1.3 - 2.3 percent daily on your investment to which you can watch generate in real time. You are also able to withdraw your profits daily or you also have the option to reinvest and compound to make increase profits. 

Like I said earlier this may sound too good to be true long term however short term, this is a great little money maker which many people are currently invested into.

Here is an example of a situation a real life investor might experience:

If you take a 30 year old and he/ she starts to invest $1500/ month (18k/ year) for 30 years (until age 60) at a imaginary 8% return per year he/she will end up with 2+ MILLION.  

That is the type of example everyone has seen, but here is what most fail to appreciate which makes investing hard for many folks even with the best intentions...

1/2 of that return (1 MILLION) was gained only in the last 7-8 years of that 30 year period.  So even if the investor was diligent and did what he/ she was supposed to do they would have felt like they weren't making any progress, i.e. spinning the wheels for the first 22 years or so!  In fact, waiting for high growth at the end is NORMAL.  Folks get bummed out they aren't millionaires after about 1, 3, 5, even 10 years, but the above person ended up with 50% of all their future money to spend in the last 8 years or so (age 52-60 in this example).

Just an observation that may help others.  The point being once  you have an set asset allocation your job is just to be a robot and save EACH month over and over again and don't worry about the total $$$ in your accounts.  The latter you won't appreciate until the end of the journey (20+ years later from when you started).

31,investing,wookie767,Facebook: a Bullish Look into Earnings," **$FB into earnings this Monday, AH.** 

I'm taking a minority view here on Facebook, and believe it'll breakout after earnings, in spite of;

1. regulatory pressures from Congress
2. SNAP's harbinger of advertising headwinds
3. Stock prices dropping after each of the last three ER's.

However, to hedge against IV crush if the price action goes bearish, I took a \*\*December Vertical Call Spread.\*\* 

(read further for rationale)===========

. The expected ER is $3.19, compared to last quarter's $3.61 actual.

. FB in their conference call had already mentioned Apple's algo

. While SNAP was greatly affected by AAPL and thus dropped a quarter of it's price, FB is far bigger and has multiple revenue streams. The impact will be minimal, and think that it will surpass estimates, top and bottom.

. POC on the daily chart (from last ER until today), is at $341, which was in the range of yesterday's trade.

. Post-ER, I'm expecting it to reach above POC (as to how far up will depend on guidance).

. Whichever way price goes post-ER, expect the price to settle around POC level. Hence, a vertical debit spread for Dec, 330/335C was a safe bet to end in profit, with a max of 110%.

45,investing,MeoMix,I am planning to make a small investment into IPv4 addresses and hold for ~5-8 years. Looking for feedback.,"Hey there. Yeah, unusual, I know. Constructive criticism, please. Let's get to it.  


The opportunity here is to capitalize on the limited amount of IPv4 addresses in open circulation. The risk is that IPv6 adoption will occur sufficiently prior to any price increase and will result in loss of demand in IPv4.  Put differently, this is a bet that companies which are unwilling, or unable, to fully adopt IPv6 will pay a significant premium to continue doing business using their current tech.  


The price of IPv4 addresses has risen from \~$8/ea in 2014 to $50/ea in 2021 ([1.](https://i.imgur.com/EqW5jKn.png))  


* One concern here is that price growth was flat in 2019 before it started growing sharply in 2020. This might be indicative of a short-term bubble due to unexpected increase demand in remote needs.
* This is a relatively high-volume market. There are tens of millions in transactions occurring weekly. ([2.](https://i.imgur.com/nbMvpKZ.png))
* You must hold purchases for two years before they are able to be resold. ([3.](https://ipv4marketgroup.com/arin34/))

IPv6 adoption has grown from 3% to 38% from 2014 to 2021. [(4.)](https://i.imgur.com/ItptmoP.png)  


* Adoption growth is linear and *slowing* \- adoption has not quickened in response to the IPv4 price hike.
* Adoption has been far slower than anticipated. ""On 7 March 2013, the Internet Engineering Task Force created a working group for IPv4 sunset ... in May 2018 this working group was closed as no immediate work could be identified due to the slow transition to IPv6."" ([5.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_deployment#Coexistence_with_IPv4))  


I think this is a good play for me personally because:  


* I work in tech and feel I understand the needs of tech decently well.
* I am looking for a 'collectible' asset for part of my portfolio. I see IPv4 addresses as something similar to investing in M:TG cards, for example. I want to hold slightly less cash without investing more into stocks or cryptocurrency.
* I do not have any reservations about holding for half a decade. This is a small amount of money (\~5% of portfolio) and have absolutely no intent of selling within two years.

I was also able to find:

&gt;We find that positive excess (strong) analyst coverage is associated with overvaluation and low future returns. This finding is consistent with the view that excessive analyst coverage, driven by investment banking incentives and analyst self-interests, raises investor optimism causing share prices to trade above fundamental value. However, weak analyst coverage causes stocks to trade below fundamental values. This finding indicates that investors tend to believe that these firms are more likely to be plagued by information asymmetries and agency problems. The results remain robust after controlling for the possible endogenous nature of analyst coverage and analysts' self-selection bias.

76,investing,HistoricallyMeans,Will the recent copper shortage be an opportunity for smaller miners?,"As the world gradually shifts to renewable energy, advancement of technologies involve a lot of renewable energy projects, the demand for copper just keeps on increasing. A lot of companies struggle to provide and respond to this demand, but there are recent issues going on with bigger companies. 

Due to the restrictions caused by the pandemic, BHP’s Escondida mine has issues in operation, resulting in a drop in their copper production. Codelco’s copper production took a dip recently, going down by 6.7% with their produce after a strike in one of their mines. Now this is critical, since both companies are mining Chile, and the country is known to be top copper producer in the world.

But as the world grapples with the copper shortage and the price surges this year, I believe smaller companies that already started producing and some that are still drilling are showing great potential to help provide and match the demand.

One miner that could be an excellent player would be [Copper Mountain Mining](https://cumtn.com/) ([CMMC](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/CMMC:TSE)). Their flagship asset is the 75% owned Copper Mountain mine located in southern British Columbia near the town of Princeton, and they are currently producing approximately 100 million pounds of copper equivalent, with average annual production expected to increase to approximately 140 million pounds of copper equivalent. They recently released drill results at their Cameron Copper Project in Australia, where three large mineralized zones are identified.

[Solaris Resources](https://www.solarisresources.com/) ([SLS](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SLS:TSE)), on the other hand, boasts the Warintza copper project in Ecuador, and this mine is along a mineral belt that hosts Lundin Gold’s Fruta del Norte Mine and a Chinese consortium’s Mirador mine, about 40 km to the south.  They have a massive cash cushion and their cash burn is way under, which can be considered as a good sign. They have about $60 million on the balance sheet right now and approximately $20 million needed for the remaining 2021 CAPEX. Their shares increased more than 8% recently after the price of copper increased throughout the week to $4.2435. 

I am looking forward to seeing the growth of [Fortitude Gold](https://www.fortitudegold.com/) ([FTCO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FTCO/)). They’re a small producer, but it is worth considering that they have no debts. They also [reported positive metallurgical test results](https://www.fortitudegold.com/news/fortitude-gold-reports-positive-golden-mile-metallurgical-test-results) from its Golden Mile property with column leach tests reporting up to 85% gold recovery. They also recently increased its monthly dividend by 14% and intercepted numerous high grade gold intercepts in untested open areas.

With global climate goals demanding for more copper, copper mining companies will need to strive to produce. There have been issues going in Peru and Chile, since its governments is threatening to increase mining taxes and regulations. With the increasing demand and the increasing prices, a lot of industries that utilize will encounter a lot of issue unless the need for the precious metals gets matched by production.",1634908649,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qdgqzj/will_the_recent_copper_shortage_be_an_opportunity/

Any opinions or thoughts on the companies below are appreciated. I have a number of other stocks i trade or hold but these are a handful of the companies I really believe in longterm with the exception of maybe snapchat. I just had to note that one due to the 22% sell-off we are seeing after hours...

Netflix - reported solid numbers overall with eps coming in at 3.19, an 83% increase over the same period last year...they brought in 7.48 Bil in revenue and 1.45 Bil in net profits. They added 4.38 million new paid subscribers and expect that number to double next quarter, bringing the total count to 213.6 million. I believe the price action to the upside is justified and will continue. 

Tesla - best quarter yet for the ev car maker ! 13.76 Bil in revenue and 1.6 Bil in net profits. Gross profit margin increased to 26.6%. They delivered 241,300 vehicles and total production came in at 237,823. Numbers looking good and the price action/sentiment is very strong. Arkk base case for tesla shares is steep but starting to sound like a very possible reality. if the stock breaks above the previous all-time-highs of 900.40 we should see a decent move to the upside. I'm thinking 1k could come quick. 

SNAP - down 22% after hours on a fairly decent Q3 report...fwd p/e is a little high so it doesn't surprise me. Investors want a big beat on these growth companies sometimes and push the price down hard if eps doesn't come in much higher than expectations 

Shopify - earnings coming up next week on October 8th along with Amazon...growth is not appearing to slow up in 2021. Looks to me like they started ballooning as a company at the perfect time. They were well positioned to take advantage of the lock downs and have managed to maintain strong sales moving forward as things begin to open back up to some degree. I do not believe a full reopening of the economy would hurt the company at all. In fact it would likely be a driving factor for more growth and would help them sure up their position in the e-commerce sector. Nothing to report here yet for Q3 but i will be waiting patiently. 

Coinbase - expected to report November 5th, seems well positioned from a TA perspective to really take advantage of what is likely to be another rally in the crypto space...

57,investing,the_arbitrage_guy,Explaining the concept behind sports arbitrage and why it is an investment and not gambling,"I don’t know how aware/interested people are in sport arbitrage ‘betting’. It says ‘betting’, however I believe it is an investment as there is no real ‘bet’ involved. Arbitrage betting is when two different bookmakers disagree on the odds of a two-way market (only two possible outcomes), therefore meaning if you bet on both sides of the market you will certainly make a small profit. An example will make things much easier:

SWEDEN VS KOSOVO - 9TH OCTOBER

MARKET - BOTH TEAMS TO SCORE

BET 1: MANSION BET (YES) ODDS - 2.45 (STAKE £125) (Potential return £306)

BET 2: BETVICTOR (NO) ODDS - 1.75 (STAKE £175) (Potential return £306)

1 bet will win the other will lose, but either way we will get back £306, when we only staked £300, this is a 2% ROI .

A 2% profit doesn’t seem like much in betting terms and is smirked at in betting communities but when you look at it as an investment it’s very exciting, I usually place arbs between 2-5%.

So why am I not a millionaire as this is essentially free money. This is the bad news; bookies don’t like it (it’s not illegal though) because they will certainly lose money over time. It’s easy to spot a foolish arbitrage bettor as they will bet on games in the Syrian 4th division etc. Therefore, there are many rules you must abide to arbitrage bet successfully. The main aim is to look like you are a punter, find arbs that are in high volume markets (top European football leagues), bet round numbers (not £97.65 etc) and at normal betting times. Eventually they will catch on to you and limit/close your betting accounts, but you can easily make a couple of thousand before then. Another difficulty is finding the arbitrage opportunities in ‘normal’ markets, as you might expect the more popular betting markets are the more efficient market odds, however there are some great tools and websites that can help.",1634848694,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qd0vaj/explaining_the_concept_behind_sports_arbitrage/

25,investing,tlsr,Options for closing a Bear Call Spread,"**Scenario:** I'll use made up numbers...  

* Broker: TDA
* Bear Call spread: $25/$35

On the day of expiry, the price of the underlying is at $29. So, the broker will do the assignment at 3:00 PM.

For clarity, my understanding of the basics of what will happen is, you have to sell the shares for $25, but have to pay $35 to get them. 

Now, if they did only the first leg of the assignment, you would own (negative) 100 shares, until the second half was executed, correct? This could happen if the $25 half of the spread is called by the holder of the contract before expiry, correct?

With that understood... Now, suppose you said that morning, well $29 is cheaper than $35, I'm just going to buy the shares now, before it gets assigned.  

It seems you could now sell the $35 call (likely for pennies), and thus reduce your loss to $400 instead of $1k?

Alternative outcome/expanding on that question:

* would buying the shares simply remove the $35 leg of the spread?
* If no, would TDA even execute that leg?

However, most of us are afraid to leave our ""comfort zone"" and stay where we are without moving.

COVID-19 has undoubtedly left many people jobless, but for someone, it has served positively as many people out of necessity have been forced to challenge themselves in other areas they may never have worked in before.

I saw that Bitcoin just reached an all-time high today and many are saying that there are altcoins in which you can invest now and maybe retire in like 5 years. Well depending on the amount you invest?

For example, I came across an article today about Josh Dorgan, a guy who was working as a nurse and trading on his lunch break. Josh started earning more from trading crypto on his break than from working full-time as a nurse

So he decided to quit his job as a nurse and became a full-time trader. Now Josh is making 7 figures as a full-time crypto trader.

And yet, there are people who call cryptocurrencies scam and worthless. But Josh's case proves otherwise. This proves that cryptocurrencies can lead to financial freedom for any individual.

90,investing,Vivid-Firefighter982,Lies My Accountant Told Me or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Roth,"This post is a summary of comments on threads and blog posts comparing traditional IRAs to Roths. In particular, I wanted to comment on and offer some arguments against 5 major points that find their way into many of the comparison threads.

**1st sentiment to dispute: low income earners who expect to make more later should do Roths, high income earners who expect to make less later should do traditional.**

I have seen this point a few times:

&gt;If you’re in a high bracket and expect little or no income in retirement take traditional. Otherwise if you’re in a low bracket now and expect more income in retirement take Roth. Or just do both.

This is how I used to think and on the surface, it is an accurate statement. I myself am currently in a high earning tax bracket, and have favored traditional IRAs historically assuming that I'll be making less in retirement. And that is true, I will have more available cash at the current time and will be paying a lower effective tax rate at the time of withdrawal.

There's one major problem: while it is true that for high income earners using a Roth you are paying a higher current tax rate, *you are paying a 0% tax rate on your gains.* This 0% tax on capital gains usually outweighs the taxes saved at time of deposit with a traditional IRA. What's even worse is that this money is taxed as ordinary income instead of as capital gains.

\-

**2nd point to dispute: the investment accounts work out to be the same over time.**

This leads me to the next sleight-of-hand that a lot of traditional IRA advocates try to pull. Take a look at [this Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZ7Qnwh1lsi87to4LpgBbVHDb3iJ7nH1-7pONCzU3yo/edit) that calculates gains for traditional vs Roth.

Now it's tempting to look at these numbers and think ""Oh see, there you go. It doesn't matter, you end up with the same money either way."" But look at the assumptions this sheet is making: Instead of having you max out your Roth, it assumes that the 5k you were going to put into your traditional IRA is reduced to 3.5k with your Roth. This is not what happens and is such a dramatic error that I think it's intentional -- who doesn't max out their Roth if they can? You're not depositing less, you're depositing the maximum and paying more in taxes (ie. losing available cash). Then, you make the same gains but with a Roth they're not taxed.

Using the scenario in the linked Excel chart we can more accurately reflect what happens for most people: you have $1250 of extra available cash each year with a traditional. 1250 x 12 = $15k over 12 years that you would have had at the cost of of $18.3k of additional taxes at retirement (with a Roth paying 37% taxes now vs with a traditional IRA paying 22% at retirement).

If you want to do the numbers again, here is another example taken from a comment comparing IRAs to Roths with the following math:

&gt;assuming 30% tax  
&gt;  
&gt;10,000 = 7,000 after tax going into roth = $122,145.82 after 30years @ 10%  
&gt;  
&gt;10,000 full going into trad/401k = $174,494 after 30years @ 10% = $122,145.82 after paying 30% tax.

This is disingenuous. Remember, a Roth is not ""tax free"" but *post-tax*. The numbers evolve differently if you are maxing your IRA out.

* *Roth investment*: 15,900 = 10,000 after tax going into Roth at 37% tax rate = $175k after 30 years at 10% - $5,900 of less available cash at the time of deposit (with a higher tax rate and principal) + $54k gained (""tax free"" or post-tax gains) at the time of withdrawal = **$49.7k overall gains.**
* *Traditional investment*: 10,000 pre-tax going into traditional IRA with $5.9k more available cash at time of deposit, in exchange for 22% tax rate at retirement instead of 37% at time of deposit as would have occurred with a Roth = $175k after 30 years; 54k gained but taxed at 22% instead of 37% = **42k overall gains.** In most of the scenarios I calculated, Roths came out ahead in the long run.

So, taking into account the different expected tax rates, with a traditional IRA you are giving up 7k of long term gains for an additional 5.9k of available cash at the current time. What you do with this money determines its *opportunity cost*.

This is a stronger [retirement tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZ4wKbUXdc8VA0mG4ri2wP9VuZCwae7b9MvA4u2HT7w/copy) developed by u/jeff_varszegi from [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/) if any of you are familiar. There are some aspects that caught my attention as needing refinement (discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/hhdvbrq/?context=3)), but my understanding is very basic and I could be missing something.

\-

**3rd point to dispute: An anti-Roth post at Go Curry Cracker**

There is a well known anti-Roth post at Go Curry Cracker entitled ""The Great Roth Controversy"" (I can't link the url as it is not allowed in the subreddit). The amount of mental gymnastics that the post undergoes to make its points is staggering:

&gt;Dollars saved in a Traditional 401k / IRA are pre-tax.  We pay no income tax on dollars going in, an immediate savings of up to 39.6%, the highest marginal rate.  The invested funds are allowed to grow **tax free**, so all interest, dividends, and capital gains are untaxed until withdrawn from the account.  Upon withdrawal, all funds are treated as ordinary income, similar to a paycheck.

This is very inaccurate wording. The invested funds in an IRA don't grow ""tax free"". As said by the author themselves in the first sentence, they grow **pre-tax**. The invested funds in a Roth also don't grow ""tax free"" but **post-tax**. This is the major benefit of a Roth over traditional.

Then the post starts talking about theoretical scenarios where a family would be paying 40% taxes with a Roth but would be reduced to poverty level income in retirement -- the so called ""first and last dollar"" argument. This is incredibly misleading. Instead it should be a ""last and last dollar"" argument. What are you paying as far as a marginal tax rate on the Traditional vs the Roth -- ie. what would an individual have been making otherwise. You have to take into account other income streams to know your base income and effective/marginal tax rates.

Another point made in this blog is that the greater available cash with a traditional IRA can then be used to invest in an index fund anyways, functionally becoming a Roth at annual capital gains tax rates. First off, why wouldn't you want post-tax gains? The point they leave unspoken is you're paying a premium for more available cash at the current time with a traditional IRA. And that's assuming an individual invests this money -- the average person is actually just redistributing savings.

For high earners that will earn less at retirement, a Roth requires a higher initial investment, but with the benefit of greater long term cash gains. With a traditional IRA, on the other hand, you are functionally increasing *available cash* because you're paying the lower tax rate that will exist when you retire. This is at the expense of *post-tax gains*.

For low earners that expect to earn *more* at retirement than they are currently, a Roth will have a lower tax rate fixed at the time of deposit as well as the ""tax-free"" gains. This is a double-win scenario with a Roth. If they had invested in a traditional IRA, it would have been a double loss.

\-

**4th point to dispute: It's pointless to try to predict the future.**

Another argument I've heard is that tax rates are difficult to predict in the future. While researching this idea I came across the following charts:

I'm not a tax expert, but from these it appears fairly reasonable to guess that incremental tax brackets won't be changing dramatically in the next few decades. If I am understanding trends shown in the linked charts, if I'm in a higher income tax bracket at retirement, then I will be paying lower taxes than now and if I'm in a lower income tax bracket at retirement (which is more likely if I haven't developed passive income) I will be paying higher taxes than now.

The more important point, as shown in the math above, is that for the average person, *tax rates* matter less than *post-tax ('tax-free') gains.* That is to say: the amount you gain in a post-tax retirement account will usually be more than the amount you save by a lower effective tax rate in a pre-tax retirement account, even in a top tax bracket.

Of course this is not a guarantee. Your Roths could be invested poorly, there could be a revolution and the entire tax structure we've had for the last century could be changed to a universal standard tax rate, you could win the lottery, etc. but at some point we have to accept that we're dealing with probabilities. If you haven't developed a cumulatively progressive source of passive income *and* you're not in a defined hierarchy (ie. a partnership track in a law firm or medical group, a path to senior management at a large corporation, etc) or you sell a product that can be leveraged to economies of scale (ie. a brand-name app), you will probably be in an eat-what-you-kill situation at retirement and so be making less in retirement than you are in middle age.

\-

**5th point to dispute: That there are universal solutions. Remember:** ***one size fits all is a size that fits none.***

**A comment I've come across is that having both a traditional IRA and a Roth is good because you're ""diversifying"".** The reasoning behind this is that a traditional IRA will be counted as part of taxable income in retirement and a Roth can be used for additional tax-free withdrawals that would put one out of their desired tax bracket.

This doesn't make sense as a general rule and must be calculated for your individual circumstances. By my own personal math, for example, it is a bad idea for me to do a traditional IRA because the lower tax rate at retirement would not compensate for the tax-free gains of a Roth. This is an example of where something that sounds like good advice (ie. ""It's always good to diversify."") actually takes you down a less financially successful path.

Another point to keep in mind is that your year to year tax situation matters a great deal. Let's say you retire early, get laid off or have a year where you are transitioning jobs so your income is low. This is a great opportunity for a Roth IRA conversion ladder -- ie. moving your pre-tax (IRA/401k) money into to post tax (Roth) accounts. Use this year as an opportunity to pay the lower effective tax rate at deposit *and* get the benefits of post-tax gains. A double-whammy of tax gains.

Looking at your specific life circumstances make it more likely that you will pick the retirement portfolio that applies to your particular path. Barring extreme examples, however, a Roth will be the better choice for most.",1634774634,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qcenkq/lies_my_accountant_told_me_or_how_i_learned_to/

11,investing,ithinktherefore88,Need Help Understanding Bond Fund Pricing During Rising Rates,"Hello there! I'm trying to wrap my head around bond fund pricing during rising rates.

Lets say rates rise. Bond funds drop in price because people are selling their older bonds with lower interest rates. Because of this the bond fund pays a higher % dividend relative to share price. 

Now, does the fund pay more interest because the fund sold the old bonds and bought new ones with higher interest? Or is it just the market pricing in the fund with the fund owning the same lower yield bonds? 

And finally, as the lower yield bonds mature in the fund, and higher yield bonds are bought, does that mean the bond fund price will rise, since the total yield relative to price of the fund grows, as old bonds mature? 

Basically, I'm trying to figure out if bond funds only take temporary hits from rising rates and eventually recover in principal price.

I have a portfolio for a medium-term objective 5-10 years, looking for the lowest possible volatility and acceptable returns for a moderate risk.

I share my comments regarding the portfolio of Ray Dalio - All seasons:

&amp;#x200B;

* **VTI - 30.00%** \- I find it adequate for the portfolio profile
* **TLT - 40.00%** \- With an increase in rates in the next few years, this could be a weak point of the portfolio as it is long-term bonds +10 years.
* **IEF - 15.00%** \- They also have sensitivity to rate increases, although it is shorter term, so it would be more tolerable.
* **DBC - 7.50%** \- I do not like commodities personally, although I understand in this portfolio the objective is to look for uncorrelated assets
* **GLD - 7.50%** \- I do not like gold personally, although I understand in this portfolio the objective is to look for uncorrelated assets

Historical:

Performance from 2013 to 2021: 7.90% YoY / Standard Dev 6.51% / Worst Year -3.25%

&amp;#x200B;

**Updated Portfolio**

So considering the above, I gave myself the task of trying to adapt the previous portfolio to reduce the possible ""risks"" that I see, with few changes, resulting in the following:

&amp;#x200B;

* **VTI - 30.00%** \- Same
* **TLT - 20.00%** \- It is reduced to 20% to reduce the risk of an increase in rates
* **IEF - 15.00%** \- Same
* **DBC - 7.50% to XLU** \- It is eliminated from the portfolio and replaced with ""utilities"" (ETF XLU), since it is an asset that has a similar correlation to commodities but a superior performance
* **GLD - 7.50%** \- Same
* **BNDX - 20%** \- International bonds from developed countries are added, which reduce the risk of TLT.

Historical updated portfolio:

49,investing,Wisser95,Long Electronic Arts ($EA),"**Long Electronic Arts ($EA)**

Electronic Arts develops and sells video games. IP includes games such as Battlefield, The Sims, and FIFA.

A substantial portion of EA’s revenue is generated from *Ultimate Team* in EA’s sports games. Based on last FY, *Ultimate Team* brings in $1.62b or 29% of EA’s total revenue. In *Ultimate Team* gamers can collect digital player cards and build their own personalised team. Buying digital loot boxes with real money is a way to speed up that process.

On June 18th, EA [introduced](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-21/news/pitch-notes-fifa21-preview-packs) *Preview Packs* to *Ultimate Team*. These new type of loot boxes lets the player see what’s inside the loot box before buying. My thesis is that these new loot boxes are underappreciated by EA’s investors. The general idea here is that opening one of those loot boxes is like playing the casino, and EA is drawing more players into the casino by now handing out a free first round of loot boxes every day. To see why this works, just imagine what would happen with Philip Morris if it was able to hand every single human a couple of free cigarette puffs every single day!

The introduction of *Preview Packs* is seen by [some](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-18-ea-adds-ultimate-team-loot-boxes-that-let-you-see-all-items-before-you-buy-in-most-significant-shakeup-of-fifa-series-in-years) as EA’s response to the increasing pressure from governments about the link between loot boxes and (underage) gambling. My firm opinion is that *Preview Packs* will generate more, and not less, revenue for EA.

The beauty of all of this is that the additional revenue from *Preview Packs* translates almost fully into bottom-line profit. Distributing one additional DIGITAL loot box comes with almost zero additional costs for EA. Revenue = profit. *Preview Packs* will thus lead to a significant boost in EBIT. To put it all in perspective, EA’s last FY revenue was $5.63b of which $1.62b *Ultimate Team* revenue, and EBIT is $1.05b. Let’s conservatively assume that *Preview Packs* leads to a 10% boost in *Ultimate Team* revenue. That’s $162m. Add that to EBIT and EBIT grows by 15.5%. That’s some nice operating leverage.

About timing. *Preview Packs* were temporarily available during the EURO2020 tournament for \~6 wks following June 18th. In earnings call 1Q2021 (qtr ending June 30rd), EA indicated that preview packs were successful and that they’ve seen increased engagement and higher rate of conversion. *Preview Packs* were then made available on a permanent basis with the launch of FIFA22 on October 1st. Because of *Preview Packs*, I expect *Ultimate Team* revenue will break records and market expectations. I expect to remain long for at least 3 months, waiting for 3Q2021 earnings (qtr ending December 31st) that should demonstrate the profitability of *Preview Packs* to EA’s investors.

Note that my investment is purely based on a puzzle piece that I think the market is missing. I have no view on the remainder of EA’s business but am nevertheless exposed to this. I am just betting on the market missing the *Preview Packs* puzzle piece. Thus, I might lose my bet for other reasons than being wrong on my investment thesis (e.g. Battlefield2042 might flop or EA correcting from a possible overvaluation). Nevertheless, I like the bet.",1634741485,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qc2mh7/long_electronic_arts_ea/

Although a much smaller developer it seems like every few days we are hearing of new defaults and growing pressure on a key area of China's economy.

Bloomberg:

"" 

[Sinic Holdings Group Co. ](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2103:HK)became the latest Chinese real estate firm to default as investors wait to see whether China Evergrande Group Inc. will meet overdue interest payments on dollar bonds this week.

Sinic’s credit rating was lowered by S&amp;P Global Ratings to Selective Default from CC after the company [failed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R182H9T1UM15) to repay the interest and principal of its $250 million note due Monday, according to a statement dated Tuesday.""

"" The strain on real estate companies add to a string of broader risks for China’s economy, which depends on the real estate market for about 30% of gross domestic product. Home prices fell in September for the first time in six years, while real estate investment slid for the first time since last year. ""

Assuming literally anyone at my school is interested, any ideas for how to simulate investing and a good incentive?","I've already got a good idea for some structures I could go for:

* I could go for a structure of 20 minutes spent teaching people about something, depending on previous knowledge, ranging from talking about stocks and ETFs to options or crypto staking/minig/trading, followed by 40 minutes of discussing investment strategies and the news relating to it.
* It could be a glorified social club with some fianncial discussion and news.
* It could be like a financial firm simulation, where I take $100 out of my current investment account and use a brokerage with fractional shares, where everyone pitches a stock or ETF, similar to the concept going on at r/InvestmentClub.
* I'm thinking of making a competition where everyone sets up a demo account and the person with the most money/assets at the end of some given time periods wins some prize. This won't take any club time, however, because school hours run through market hours.
* I could entirely steer clear of investments and go over only safe money-making ways like bank savings accounts, and go over general things of how to manage your money.

Hoping for some input on what y'all think may be the best idea if I'm looking to attract some high-schoolers into learning about fiannces and ideally making money! Part of what's in it for me and what motivates me to look into it is that teaching others and having others in real life to discuss things with makes me more motivated to care about investing, trading, and generally making money through the purchasing, holding, and selling, of assets (and I like hearing myself talk when I believe it's something that will benefit people :) ).",1634695360,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qbqhs9/im_considering_starting_an_investing_club_for/

I have a close relationship with an old professor of mine who teaches investments at the college level, we often chat. He was a derivatives trader for 20 years back in the 80s and 90s.

He swears and insists that when rates begin to rise the market is going to absolutely eat shit, and most if not all valuations will drop. He says that the market has been hooked on the feds liquidity since ‘08 and the withdrawals will be severe. He has been slowly divesting the past few months.

I see where he is coming from, and he is obviously much wiser than me. In class he would always preach about if a stock falls 50% you need 100% gain to make your money back, therefore avoiding downside is much better than missing a little upside, which I also agree with.

What I am not so sure of is that rising rates will spell doom for the markets. The most I could see is maybe slowed growth? But if rates steadily climb to around 4% on the 10 year that would actually be GOOD For the economy.

$TBLT : https://youtu.be/5sRJreGE2i4

And here i explained why Asensus is a good buy for short term. Anthony Fernando is really smart. They announced one Senhance purchase from Russia and one from Japan.  However they didn't use the word purchase for Japan. So i believe it is a leasing contract. 
But the interesting point is the date of announcement.  One 27 th and other 29 th September. Exactly before end of Q3. now :
Last quarter revenue without any sales was 1.1 million and EPS -0.07 . Revenue earned through 30 active Senhances .they are performing around 500 surgery per quarter. Company has a solid passive income. now if we assume each Senhance cost around 1.2 million and even if we don't count leasing contract from Japan, it means Q3 revenue should be more than 2.3 million. That means more than 100% than last quarter and i expect 25% or 50% better EPS than last quarter.  So in my eyes Asensus is shining as a good buy opportunity . Personally i will consider purchasing some shares one week before Q3 earning call. Of course not a financial advice and it's just my personal thoughts :)

74,investing,Shanemonksobyrne,The 14 Most Important Investing Lessons From Ben Graham,"I am an avid collector of quotes. Each time I come across one that I like, I jot it down. Some of these are investing related, many are from other aspects of life. I have found Ben Graham - the grandfather of value investing, and mentor to Warren Buffett, to have some of the most actionable investment quotes out there. I dissected 14 of my favourite and discuss the lesson.

## 1. Quality &gt; Glamour

*“If you are shopping for common stocks, chose them the way you would buy groceries, not the way you would buy perfume.”*

Though a bit enigmatic, there is real meaning behind this quote from Graham. What does he mean?

**Buy high quality, good value, healthy companies** rather than companies that just look good at first *sniff.*

## 2. Growth ≠ Profits

*“Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.”*

**Beware of growth stocks.** Short term gain might mean long term pain.

## 3. Periodically review your holdings

“*Most businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse. The investor need not watch his companies’ performance like a hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time.”*

A good time to review your holdings is each rebalance period. For example, A quantitative investment  strategy might have a 1 month rebalance period. This means you will review your portfolio each month, selling some stocks and buying others.

## 4. Market Downturns are SERIOUS opportunities

*“Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal. At other times he will do better if he forgets about the stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies.”*

I’m a big believer that investors have the definition of risk slightly wrong. Most of the time, risk is interchanged with volatility. But they are not synonymous. *E*=mc2 , Paris is the capital of France, and stocks go up and down over time. The risk comes not from whether they go down (though this is important), but rather from how likely the individual is to sell the stock at precisely the wrong time.

**Market dips are great opportunities** to hop in and buy at amazing bargain prices. Just make sure you are ready to strike when the moment is right. Have cash ready to invest.

## 5. Investing vs. Speculating

*“The most realistic distinction between the investor and the speculator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements. The speculator’s primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor’s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell.”*

Buy and Hold. A simple rule for long-term investing success. **Your time horizon needs to be 10 years or more. If it is not, you are gambling.**

## 6. Ensure you are buying high quality stocks

*“The risk of paying too high a price for good-quality stocks – while a real one – is not the chief hazard confronting the average buyer of securities. Observation over many years has taught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low-quality securities at times of favorable business conditions. The purchasers view the current good earnings as equivalent to “earning power” and assume that prosperity is synonymous with safety.”*

Warren Buffett initially adopted Graham’s Net-Net approach to buying stocks. a purely deep value approach. He was very successful in this method of investing, however as Berkshire Hathaway grew, this method of investing became unscalable, and so a quality-centric approach was adopted.

**Buy Undervalued, High quality companies.** For example, the Magic Formula (Joel Greenblatt) selects Deep value (Low EV / EBITDA) and good quality (High ROIC) companies.

## 7. There is risk in every investment

*“Even with a margin \[of safety\] in the investor’s favor, an individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees only that he has a better chance for profit than for loss – not that loss is impossible.”*

There is always a chance you’ve bought a bad egg. Just make sure you have more good eggs than bad ones. Its like winning an election: You don’t need every vote to win – you just need a majority! This analogy was taken from James Clear's book *Atomic Habits.*

## 8. Investment success is achievable

*“To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier than most people realize; to achieve superior results is harder than it looks.”*

Heres some formulas for you:

a) How to underperform the market: Pick stocks qualitatively

b) How to match the market: Buy an index fund

c) How to beat the market: Pick stocks quantitatively. Note: check out [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q6nj94/a_checklist_for_picking_great_stocks_warren/) on how to pick stocks quantitatively (using checklists).

## 9. Hold Fast

*“Most of the time stocks are subject to irrational and excessive price fluctuations in both directions as the consequence of the ingrained tendency of most people to speculate or gamble … to give way to hope, fear and greed.”*

Risk is how likely you are to sell. Reduce risk by NOT SELLING! Reduce risk by [creating an investment thesis](https://learn.aikido.finance/blog/post/how-to-create-an-investment-thesis/) that you cannot waver from.

## 10. Remember your history lessons

*“They used to say about the Bourbons that they forgot nothing and they learned nothing, and \[what\] I’ll say about the Wall Street people, typically, is that they learn nothing, and they forget everything.”*

Right now, this quote could not be more apt. The market is in a frenzy, with the [S&amp;P500 having a P/E ratio of 33](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio)! Let us not fall into the frenzy and leave our senses behind us. Remember what has happened during [bubbles](https://learn.aikido.finance/blog/post/5-signs-that-were-in-a-stock-market-bubble/) in the past: they pop. Use an investment strategy – quantify what you are doing.

## 11. Be careful of sexy products

Fundamentals about silver say two things: With increasing use for EV, electronics and solar panels silver is not only a monetary metal like gold, but also an industrial metal with increasing demand from these industries.

„Traditionally, silver prices have tracked gold prices fairly closely, which makes sense given that both function as monetary metals, and they often occur together in mineral deposits. The correlation between gold and silver since 1975 has been 0.8876. The 10-year correlation coefficient is 0.7511. However this year, the correlation has dropped significantly to 0.1959. The reason is the fact that both copper and silver are being increasingly demanded in green energy applications.“

(https://www.mining.com/web/silver-seen-tracking-copper-prices-higher/)

Other than Gold, Silver is increasingly used by industry:

After a bearish trend silver seems to have found a bottom and technical indicators turn bullish.

Looking at the supply situation it must be noted that Silver is mined mostly as a byproduct from other mining operations, but Silver is limited.

Roughly speaking - arbitrage is an investment opportunity/strategy that never loses money, but has an opportunity to make it. 

With that being said - I'd like to think about the following strategy. AMEX cards currently allow users to venmo money at no cost - e.g. one can use their AMEX card with venmo for no fee. In some sense, one can use this to get interest free margin (for a period until the credit card bill is due) - venmo a trusted friend or relative using an AMEX card, and have them venmo you back. Thus, I propose the following:

1. Use the above mechanism to get some money into your bank account. 
2. Move the money into ultra short duration bonds, or even more safely, a high-yield savings account, like those of Ally bank. The nice thing about the savings account is there's no need to transact on a secondary market, and zero probability of paying any transaction costs.
3. Collect the interest on the account, and pay back the AMEX bill. If you'd like, you can even compensate your trusted friend with a fraction of the interest, or you two can be counterparties for each other in this scheme!

This can even be automated with automatic payments to AMEX from the savings account in question - the only thing that cannot be automated is the venmo to and from your counterparty.

That being said - is there any reason this is not a feasible strategy? The only risks I can see are 

1. opportunity cost - the profit from such a strategy is on the order of cents or single dollars per month. You might as well use your time to do something actualy useful :)
2. Mismatching cash flows so that you miss a credit card payment and get hit with interest (which will probably wipe out your profits lol), but if setup properly this should never happen.",1634590610,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qavtse/amex_venmo_arbitrage_thoughts/

Adding to the sense of weakness in the data, industrial output  in August was revised to a fall of 0.1% versus the prior estimate of a  0.4% gain.

This is the biggest decline since February, when Winter Storm Uri  wreaked havoc in Texas. Manufacturing had been a bright spot even though  the sector is struggling with supply bottlenecks. 

Some  of the weakness was due to Hurricane Ida. The hurricane cut about 0.6  percentage points from the drop in total industrial production, the Fed  said.

 Output at manufacturers fell  0.7% in September, led by a 7.2% drop in production of motor vehicles  and parts. Excluding the auto sector, manufacturing was down 0.3%.

By the same token, since it's a major blue chip stock and already has a massive market cap, I'm not really sure if it even makes sense to buy as a single stock or if I should just invest the money into index funds that would naturally have Disney holdings and might have higher annual returns...?

I do already hold S&amp;P stocks and my 401k is heavily comprised of a Fidelity SP500 stock, so that's why I'm hesitant to not diversify somewhat more.

Quahl is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of payment cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the quahl, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating quahls for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your quahls can be worth a lot.

12,investing,Most-Ad7385,Is it still ideal to invest in copper stocks?,"With all that’s been going on, it makes me contemplate if investing in it is still a good idea. Just recently state miner Codelco’s copper production for the month of August took a dip, going down by 6.7% year-on-year to 144,500 tonnes due to a strike in one of their mines. BHP, another big company, showed a drop in their copper production as well because their Escondida mine has issues in operation due to the imposed restriction caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Chile is the top producer in the world when it comes to copper, so the production getting affected is a big deal.

Another issue is also the problem with property giant China Evergrande Group. The company encountered a debt crisis that caused copper prices to fall, fueling worries about the demand for the metal. The price touched at $4.090 per pound ($8,998 per tonne) on the Comex market in New York. Though it seemed to have bounced back recently after they announced a deal over a $35.9 million bond interest payment.

Because of all these. I’m contemplating if it’s still smart to invest in it. I’ve been looking into some recently. I got my eyes on bigger ones like BHP and FCX (especially this one, I heard a lot of good things about it). I feel like it is safer to invest in these since they are already big producers.

Progenity, Inc. engages in the provision of molecular and specialized diagnostic tests to clinicians. Its products include Preparent Carrier Test, Innatal Prenatal Screen, Riscover Hereditary Cancer Test, and Resura Prenatal Test. 

Case for Short-Squeeze

1. Prog has one of the highest SI (about 64%) while only one entity is trying to keep the price suppressed (Athyrium).

2. CTB continues to rise everyday as per Ortex data

3. Ortex has issued all 3 signals of short-squeeze on Prog

4. It’s a penny stock at a price that anyone who is in stock market investing can easily buy and hold to add to buying pressure.

5. Price jump from 0.88 to 2.5 brought in a lot of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 calls option ITM for 10/15

6. The company shorting it doesn’t have unlimited money supply to keep the price suppressed unlike a hedgefund that can/does divert all their money to control any stock they want.

7. **Catalysts:** Prog already got a patient approved October 5th but no PR because of the Athyium manipulation below (personal opinion).

a. **Evidence (**[**Look at the date of recent patent**](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/progenity-inc)**)**

8. **No unlimited money for Athyrium to short:** Athyrium isn’t in core business of shorting to make money and continue to do until they win. This factor alone along with buying pressure will force them to wave white flag within days-not weeks.

**Why Athyrium is shorting is and is in trouble now.**

1. Athyrium has a pattern of suppressing price to buy low as many shares as they can to take control of the company and then sell at a premium ([Evidence](https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-verenium.php))

2. However, this time around Athyrium gets caught with Prog where retail picked this stock and brought into light of short-squeeze play.

3. Shorting means that this insider has to cover its short position eventually and they don’t have enough time and only hope is more share issue which is not happening until November 20th and actually may not even happen if squeeze happens before end of October. 

4. They hoped that retail eye won’t catch prog and hence they can cover  lower when the time comes

5. **Evidence of Athyrium manipulation: (**[**https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-verenium.php**](https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-verenium.php)**).** This article clearly shows that Athyrium is not new to this and was able to do this before, only difference is that Prog got retail attention making it difficult to manipulate easily. 

**a.** **Barcoding:**  The price is experiencing barcoding last whole week where it moves by 10 cents and then whole day is a move of max 4-5 cents each day. This is their tactic to continue buying lower to accumulate and hope retail pressure doesn’t come in.

**b.** **Way to break barcoding:**  With enough volume in even 1 day, tables will be turned and any price above $2.5 in coming week gives majority control to retail to make squeeze happen.

**Scenario 1 of Short Squeeze.**

**1.** With enough volume (500 Mil to a billion), the play will be totally out of Athyrium’s hands because it can lead to a price range of $2.40-$3.25 hopefully this coming week.

**2.** This will force Athyrium to cover its position and trigger a gamma-squeeze effect prior to 10/15.

**Scenario 2 of Short Squeeze.**

**1.** Continuing with first scenario, the price will be in $5 and above range in following week of 10/15

**2.** Buyout option is still on the table which means Prog can never be sold under $5 and price decided for buyout is $8-$10 so every retail investor makes money while Athyrium goes home defeated with their lesser shares and whatever price.

**Scenario 3 of Short Squeeze.**

**1.** The buying pressure from scenario 3 continues leading the prog price in high double digits, leading to no share issue possibility at all and buyout still happens which means still atleastt 50%-70% premium on that price (Let’s say $25 + 50%-70%).

**Scenario 4 of Short Squeeze (Least desirable for retail investors).**

**1.** Athyirum continues to do its shit plan and keeps price down before buyout. They will cover at lower cost and everyone holding shares makes just good enough profit at $4 price buyout.

**How to make squeeze happen:**

1. Significant ITM calls buy volume for those who love option play.

2. One day of 300-500 Mil in volume with buying pressure to just start the squeeze this week

45,investing,Che74,China’s Power Crisis Will Affect Industries Worldwide,"Prefaced from Bloomberg Opinion:

Flooding in the coal hub of Shanxi province have driven prices up to $234 a metric ton as the government tries to kickstart extra production, further measures are needed to prevent more generators cutting off their turbines and causing blackouts through northern China’s winter. That means a crackdown on the factories that still consume the majority of electricity.  Industry makes up 25% of grid demand in the U.S., in China it’s 59%  — more than all the country’s homes, offices and retail stores put together. Cheap power has been essential for development in China. The problem now is that coal is very expensive. That’s where renewables come in. At the same time that price curbs are being removed from industries, capacity curbs are being lifted from zero-carbon power generation. With zero-carbon electricity already cheaper than most existing operating coal power plants, those changes may be just the spur to wean China from solid fuels.   

For those with Bloomberg:

I am going to be distributing the funds across a few pretty basic ETF's and won't be touching them much (other than some minor quarterly readjustments). While I will mostly be buying and holding, I will also be doing some minor speculation type investments with about 2% of my deposits.  I'm mainly looking at Schwab, Fidelity, Merrill edge and maybe vanguard. 

The main thing that I'm looking at since I'm a buy and hold investor is that it won't be expensive. I think all of these have free etf and basic stock trades, so this doesn't really seem to be all that relevant for these. While I'm going to be far from a very active trader, some nice features like good research and screeners would definitely be beneficial. Also a good platform experience would be nice.

(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said this year’s inflation surge is lasting longer than policymakers expected, so it’s not appropriate to refer to such price increases as transitory. 

“Transitory is a dirty word,” Bostic said in a virtual speech to the Peterson Institute for International Economics on Tuesday. He spoke with a glass jar labeled “transitory” at his side, depositing $1 each time he used the “swear word,” as it’s become known to him and his staff over the past few months. 

“It is becoming increasingly clear that the feature of this episode that has animated price pressures — mainly the intense and widespread supply-chain disruptions — will not be brief,” Bostic said. “By this definition, then, the forces are not transitory.”

Bostic, who votes on monetary policy this year, endorsed the Federal Open Market Committee’s plans to taper its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases, which is likely to start at its November meeting. In a Q&amp;A with Peterson President Adam Posen, Bostic said U.S. growth and the recovery in employment have exceeded his expectations.

“I’ve adjusted my ‘dot plot’ submissions to reflect much greater growth, much more in terms of jobs and also higher inflation,” Bostic said, referring to the committee’s quarterly interest rate forecasts. “It’s also called me to pull forward some of my thinking about when interest rate liftoff will be. That’s still more than a year off in my forecasts.”

Tapering is unlikely to slow the economy because markets are functioning well and the issues with the U.S. economy are more about supply-chain disruptions from Covid-19 rather than demand, he said in the Q&amp;A.

Bostic’s concern with inflation was echoed by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said he favors starting to taper in November and finishing by the first quarter of 2022 to give the central bank flexibility to raise rates if necessary.

“The story that inflation will come down naturally is a reasonable one, but I only want to put 50% probability on that scenario,” Bullard said Tuesday in a televised interview with CNBC. “I have got to put some probability on a scenario where inflation stays high or even goes higher.”

In his prepared remarks, Bostic said he was seeing signs of a broadening in inflation.

“I believe evidence is mounting that price pressures have broadened beyond the handful of items most directly connected to supply-chain issues or the reopening of the services sector,” he said.

He said longer-run inflation expectations measures have climbed, with many reaching decade highs.

“These upside risks to the inflation outlook bear watching closely,” Bostic said. “Up to now, indicators do not suggest that long-run inflation expectations are dangerously untethered. But the episodic pressures could grind on long enough to unanchor expectations. We will be watching carefully.”

* find the top holding of the ETF and its % of funds
* look up the market cap of the holding
* divide the market cap of the holding by the percent of funds

For example, for VSS, the largest holding is WSP Global Inc. @ 0.41% of funds. WSP Global Inc.'s market cap is $19.15 billion. So, VSS's ""exposed"" market cap is $19.15 billion / 0.41% = $4.67 trillion, which is much more than $11.6 billion.

31,investing,rarelywearamask,"Are paper losses in your stock market investments ""real losses"" to you?","Back in my foolish days, I invested a significant share of my money in individual stocks.  While I made money in many of these investments I did pick lots of losers.  I still hold on to these stocks years later and many are down 40-80% from my purchase price.

My wife tells me they are only paper losses because they still have some value but I have not sold them.  I consider any stock, Mutual Fund, or ETF that I own that is not currently at its all-time high price since the day I bought them to be a loss.  (So I am down in all my stock market investments since early September when the market peaked.)

I look at the stocks, ETF's and Mutual Funds in my portfolio to be like casino chips at the casino.  If I am in Las Vegas on a four-night trip and are winning on days 1-3 and at my peak had doubled my money and don't cash in my chips if day four is a loser and I end up just slightly above my starting cash position, I would leave town feeling like a loser because I could have cashed out at the end of day three after I had doubled my investment.

How do you see it?",1634311209,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q8qnjc/are_paper_losses_in_your_stock_market_investments/
32,investing,cefpodoxime,Inflation remains transitory. The Swedish experience tells us at least that much.,"https://images.mktw.net/im-417786?width=700&amp;size=1.8577648766328012&amp;pixel_ratio=2

U.S. consumer prices matched a 30-year high in September with 5.4% year-over-year growth.

That makes sense. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the policy response of lockdowns and government stimulus, unleashed a massive switch in spending from services to goods. Spending on U.S. durable goods, in March, was 26% above its pre-pandemic trend.

“Suffice to say, a 26% excess demand for durable goods cannot be satisfied by a modern manufacturing sector that utilizes just-in-time supply chains and negligible spare capacity! As surging demand met relatively fixed supply, the price of durable goods skyrocketed to the current 11% above its pre-pandemic trend,” said Dhaval Joshi, chief strategist of BCA Research’s Counterpoint.

The surprise however has been the stickiness of services prices. That, Joshi explained, is because it wasn’t a classic demand shock. There was no point in services companies reducing prices because their customers couldn’t get those services anyway. “Meanwhile, statisticians continued to record the seemingly unaffected price of eating out or going to the theater, even though most restaurants and entertainment venues were shut,” he said.

There’s one notable country that didn’t mandate shutdowns or lockdowns — Sweden. And there, services prices did decline. And now, inflation in Sweden is about 3 percentage points less than in the U.S.

What the Swedish experience suggests is that prices will eventually stabilize. “The surging demand for durables is correcting. Since March, it is already down by 15% but requires a further 7% decline to reach its pre-pandemic trend, which we fully expect to happen. After all, there are only so many smartphones and used cars that you can own,” Joshi said.

As for services, there are two forces — the wage rises as a result of the rocketing price of goods, but the deflationary force of hybrid home and office working, which will make it difficult for services spending to reach its pre-pandemic trending.",1634310422,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q8qdnu/inflation_remains_transitory_the_swedish/

34,investing,OfficerCHODEMAN,$GWH has potential to be the future of renewable battery tech,"Hi guys, lucky for me, GWH came onto my radar two weeks ago when I was looking into the plans for Sun Cable, an Australian plan to provide up to 15% of Singapores daily electricity needs via massive solar farms and an undersea cable.

The main challenge with renewables at the moment is battery storage. Renewables are now the cheapest power source available but face massive constraints in the form of consistent supply and grid smoothing. Lithium ion mega storages are currently the answer but have many drawbacks. High fire risk, 4 hour max storage, fast degradation, high price, environmentally damaging disposal and need for cooling.

Enter ESS storage ($GWH) an iron flow battery made of Iron and electrolytes and salt water. Iron flow batteriy is a type of electrochemical cell where chemical energy is provided by two chemical components dissolved in liquids that are pumped through the system on separate sides of a membrane.\[2\]\[3\] Ion exchange (accompanied by flow of electric current) occurs through the membrane while both liquids circulate in their own respective space. (wikipedia)

ESS could be the future for renewable storage and billionaire backers like Bill Gates are all over the future tech ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/ess-battery-company-backed-by-bill-gates-softbank-opens-on-nyse.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/ess-battery-company-backed-by-bill-gates-softbank-opens-on-nyse.html)). It has a very reasonable 70% round trip efficiency, meaning it loses 30% of the power you put into it.

ESS has a few advantages over lithium ion; No need for cooling so can be used in hot environments like Texas, Australia, California. Extremely cheap source materials. Storage up to 10 hours. 20,000 cycle life and NO storage degradation versus 5000 cycle life for lithium ion.

The downside I can see for this stock are new battery techs stealing market share. Slow adoption of renewables. Or potentially extreme price drop in lithium ion cost, tech or safety.

I am long on this stock

Something curious I noticed this morning is GHW had a high short borrow fee (130%) whilst there are only 4.3 million shares available for public trading due to 180 day lockup([https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/q6c8gl/gwh\_ess\_tech\_backed\_by\_bill\_gates\_and\_me\_started/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/q6c8gl/gwh_ess_tech_backed_by_bill_gates_and_me_started/)). GWH has already squeezed once. The reason GWH squeezed initially is because a lot of people are shorting SPACs as they have fallen out of favour to investors recently AND GWH had a high redemption of shares (bailing out of the SPAC)

I am long on this company so squeezes do not interest me too much but it is something to note.",1634307758,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q8phxf/gwh_has_potential_to_be_the_future_of_renewable/

Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently received an optimistic outlook from Jefferies Equity Research, with analyst Philippe Houchois raising his price target on the automaker from $850 to $950 per share. Jefferies cited several reasons behind its update on TSLA stock, though the analyst noted that part of it is due to the growing gap between Tesla and legacy OEMs. 

“We raise EBIT estimates 7-9% for 2022-23 and PT to $950 on higher capacity ramp and sustained demand, following further analysis of Q3 data and various sources of information on the soon-to-be-launched Berlin facility. For some time, the narrative has been legacy OEMs closing the gap; we see little evidence as Tesla continues to challenge at multiple levels. We raise EBIT and margin estimates in contrast with doubts about earnings momentum across legacy OEMs,” Houchois wrote in a note.",1634296852,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q8mcsk/jefferies_raises_tesla_tsla_price_target_to_950/

I’m planning to go with [Barrick Gold Corp](http://www.barrick.com/English/home/default.aspx) ([ABX.TO](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ABX.TO)). They are showing good performance as their total preliminary gold production [rose to 1.09 million ounces](https://www.reuters.com/business/barrick-third-quarter-gold-output-rises-nearly-5-sequentially-2021-10-14/), from 1.04 million ounces in the previous quarter.

33,investing,emikoala,Invested in a bad actor? You might be entitled to free money(!),"Earlier this year I saw something online somewhere about a class action suit against $INFN, and since I live by the motto ""always join the settlement class"" I submitted my contact info to the law firm filing the suit. I ended up agreeing to be a lead plaintiff.

Infinera settled before going to trial, but the lawyers secured me an incentive award from the courts as part of the settlement, as compensation for being a lead plaintiff. I was honestly expecting to get like 15 bucks thrown my way if there was a settlement - over the years I've received several settlement awards, a few for $100 or $200 but the vast majority end up being &lt;$25, and I've never been lead plaintiff before and didn't have any idea what to expect - so I was completely surprised when **they sent me a $1,000 check!!** 

I can't stress enough how little effort was required on my part. I signed an agreement to let them represent me, sent them redacted PDF copy of my brokerage statement to confirm I owned the shares during the settlement period, and sent maybe 3 one-sentence emails over a period of about 3 months authorizing them to take each of steps they advised taking on my behalf. I paid nothing out of pocket and here's the real kicker: I only held like $300 worth of $INFN, it was little more than a bet I placed for funsies. A surprise 3-bagger over just a 1 year holding period!

Today I learned of another class action lawsuit against a company I placed a $200 bet on earlier this year ($APPH), which is currently down -66%. Even if I just recover some of the \~$130 lost it'd be worth it for how little effort is involved, but if I get asked to be lead plaintiff again and the incentive award is $1,000 again, or even $500 or $250, I'll be thrilled!

I was represented by a firm that specializes in these type of shareholder class actions and has several cases going at a time. [You can scroll through a list of them on their website to see if you hold shares in any companies in litigation.](https://www.zlk.com/press) A Google search indicates there are also several other law firms that do the same thing, but I don't have experience with any of the others, so I'm putting it on my to-do list to see what cases other firms are working on!

To my understanding, they are credits that allow companies to pollute the environment to a certain extent each year and companies that don’t pollute that much can sell their credits to other companies. The idea is that in the future, governments can basically reduce the carbon allowances of all companies (essentially reducing supply) and the price per carbon credit will rise accordingly.

How I see it, the macro-environment is really stacked against crypto-mining stocks AFTER the current bull run is over. Bitcoin usually takes 1-2 years to decline to a new low (this time a good estimate is probably 75% from ATH); interest rates are likely to go up in the next 1-2 years making the debt these companies have more difficult to service; and most importantly, these stocks are momentum-driven, when investors realize the bull run is over I think many will not want to wait years to see new highs. All of this is skipping over the real possibility of any kind of stock market correction, minor or major, because we are close to ATHs in most markets.

77,investing,X-2357,IONq &amp; Quantum Computers are already here,"IONq is the first of many world changing quantum computer companies. Rigetti uses traditional superconducting quantum arrays that translate a little easier to conventional computers. The huge downside is the need for extreme cooling. Rigetti uses multi layers where the innermost layer is 100x colder than outerspace. Xanadu uses photonic systems that are great, and run at room temp but they need lots of additional hardware to work and will be difficult to scale down. Microsoft is working on topological arrays which would provide utility benefits but it hasn't been proven yet and they had to retract one of their papers on it. The point is that there are various methods to how you can create and manipulate qubits, the foundation for quantum computing.

IONq uses trapped ions, from a single atom of ytterbium. Technically a rare metal but it's not rare. Then they manipulate the ions using lasers to create the qubits on the array. Sh*t is bleeding edge and I understand .005% of it but I read everything I can find. It can run at room temp and be easily scaled. Basically IONq doesn't need all the extra resources to create and manipulate their qubits, so the cost and energy requirements are down. This also allows for upscaling arrays on existing hardware. Like they can turn a 16 qubit system into a 64 qubit system eventually using the same stuff  they just have to reduce the expected errors that come with quantum computing.

IONq got starting investment money from Amazon, Bill Gates, Samsung, Lockheed Martin, Hyundai, goldman sachs and more. They used that money to prove the tech works and are currently operating with Amazon Braket as their most powerful hardware supplier. Currently IONq has the most powerful quantum computer in business operation at 32 qubits. The next closest comp is 16 qubits. And you can have 9 qubit, 11 qubits computers, it doesn't need to be doubled evenly like ram for instance.

Remember when you see qubit numbers in the future and from other companies, what that really means.

Quantum computing is based on ""physical qubits"" and ""digital"" simulated qubits. Conventional computers use bits.

No matter what method you use, ions, photonic, superconducting, etc, You can't have a fully isolated qubit because then you couldn't interact with it to manipulate and tell it what to do. To get around this, modern quantum computing is based on running ""leaking"" environments with varying fidelity and trackable errors. We use the say 93% that is still functional to simulate more isolated qubits, and use those to simulate even more isolated qubits, in deeper layers until we have a fully isolated qubit we can error correct. 

Eventually we need 1 million qubit machines to simulate 10k error corrected machines. IONq just demonstrated how they can scale up to a million at a recent presentation. Eventually a QPU could really lead to some radically advancements in financial predictions, cybersecurity and encryption, biotech discovery, simulation modeling and on and on.

They SPAC merged with DMYI with $600m , $350m of which is pipe investment that is locked up for 6 months from now. Ran to $12 before merger, tanked to $10 at merger, tanked to $7.30 during spy correction and tech sell off. It was mostly shorts based on volume. They have tiny revenue because they are just getting started but that doesn't matter imo. They had that white house presentation to show off and IONq is the only pure quantum computer company on the market so far, with rigetti spac io'ing in a few months.

&gt; HONG KONG - China Evergrande Group on Tuesday missed its third round of bond payments in three weeks, intensifying market fears over contagion involving other property developers as a wall of debt payment obligations come due in the near-term.
Some bondholders said they did not receive coupon payments totalling US$148 million on Evergrande's April 2022, April 2023 and April 2024 notes due by 0400 GMT on Tuesday, following two other payments it missed in September.

&gt; That puts investors at risk of large losses at the end of 30-day grace periods as the developer wrestles with more than $300 billion in liabilities.

- Earnings of $3.74 per share vs. $3 per share estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.

- Revenue: $30.44 billion vs $29.8 billion estimate.

The gain came after the bank released $2.1 billion in reserves and had $524 million of net chargeoffs in the quarter, New York based JPMorgan said in a release. The bank produced $3.74 per share in earnings, which includes a 52 cent per share boost from reserve releases and a 19 cent per share benefit tied to a tax filing.

The bank “delivered strong results as the economy continues to show good growth - despite the dampening effect of the Delta variant and supply chain disruptions,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in the statement. “We released credit reserves of $2.1 billion as the economic outlook continues to improve and our scenarios have improved accordingly.”",1634127338,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q79v3p/jpmorgan_exceeds_profit_expectations_on_15/

27,investing,TrumpsThirdTesticle,AT&amp;T Merger - Does my math check out on the merger and dividend? What are your thoughts?," 

I'm aware many despise AT&amp;T - this is an objective view - not saying buy/hold/sell, just want to discuss.

Current Share Price = $25.42 / Current Dividend = 8.81% / Annual Dividend = $2.08.

Projected dividend after the Warner bros/Disc deal = $1.11 per share annualized.

Projected yield after the merger at current price = 4.4%.

Assuming the following:

* 7.1 billion AT&amp;T shares on issue
* Value of Warner bros Discovery 120 bil (High), 100 bil (mid), 80 bil (low) and 60 bil (conservative)
* T shareholders get 70% of shares in new company
* Dividend after merger cut to $1.11 per share

With the following calculation:

(value of new company \* 70%) / 7.1 billion shares on issue = Value of new company per AT&amp;T share

So...

1. (120 billion \* 70%) / 7.1billion = $11.83 per share (High value)
2. (100 billion \* 70%) / 7.1billion = $9.85 per share (Mid value)
3. (80 billion \* 70%) / 7.1 billiion = $7.88 per share (Low value)
4. (60 billion \* 70%) / 7.1 billiion = $5.91 per share (Conservative value)

So... at the current valuation assuming no price change after merget

1. High value = $37.25 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T 25.43)
2. Mid Value = $35.27
3. Low Value = $33.3
4. Conservative Value= $31.00

Extra scenario 1 - assume that AT&amp;T price drops to maintain a dividend yield of at least 6% (to be 1% higher than near competitor Verizon which has a safer dividend... = T Share price of $18.5

1. High value = $30.33 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T $18.5)
2. Mid Value = $28.35
3. Low Value = $26.38
4. Conservative Value= $24.41

Extra scenario 2 - assume that AT&amp;T price drops to maintain a dividend yield of at least 7% (restored to the beloved 7%) = T Share price of $15.85

1. High value = $27.68 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T $15.85)
2. Mid Value = $25.7
3. Low Value = $23.78
4. Conservative Value= $21.76

This is Rollercoin which is over 3 years old now. In fact, the game is all about virtually mining bitcoin, ethereum, or doge. But, although the game is virtual, you still earn bitcoins.

Basically, the idea is that every 5 minutes or so (depending on the hash powers), players receive the rewards for resolving a block in the blokchain. The rewards are even stronger than the miner at high power.

Yes, it works the same as bitcoin mining in “real life” (oh yeah). So it works as if you had to run a mining farm. That is, you will have to manage the electricity, your rigs, your installations etc.

To create Mining Power, you will need to play games. The more you play, the higher your power and therefore the more you win. It is by playing the various games in RollerCoin that you ""mine"" bitcoin (or etherum, doge). The more you play, the more you win.

You can also mine the site's crypto which is the rollertoken to buy miners. You can convert everything to rollertokens by the way. This token is not real but it intends to create an ecosystem with it. They also want to make an NFT system. The site is progressing quite quickly at the project level and it is starting to be nice.

But now once i try to follow one i get distracted from the other setups and try to include them in which makes it way harder. And i catched an OCD where i won't take a trade until it's a pin bar.

**Abstract:**

&gt;While major stock market indices are followed by large monetary investments, we document that 
membership decisions  for  the  S&amp;P  500  index  have  a  nontrivial  amount  of  discretion.  We  show that  firms’  purchases of  S&amp;P  ratings  appear  to  improve  their  chance  of  entering  the  index  (but purchases  of  Moody’s  ratings do  not).  Furthermore,  firms  tend  to  purchase  more  S&amp;P  ratings when there are openings in the index membership. Such a pattern is also confirmed by an event study that explores a rule change on index membership in 2002. Finally, discretionary additions exhibit subsequent deterioration in financial performance relative to rule-based additions.

I remember way back in the day I earned just $5 a month in passive income, so $50 a week sounds a lot better than what I used to have, so I am a bit proud of it. I just want to know if this is really something to be proud of or if it's a minuscule amount that I should pay no mind to.

I'm 21 so I plan to let this compound for years and years while continuing to save and invest.",1633984001,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q64y36/is_earning_50_a_week_in_passive_income_substantial/

56,investing,ChocolateTsar,Apple decides its victory against Epic wasn’t enough — it wants a total win,"&gt;[**Apple**](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL) **wants another go in its legal battle against Epic Games.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**On Friday night,** [**Apple announced it would ask for a stay**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/apple-files-appeal-in-epic-games-case-that-could-delay-changes-.html) **on a judge’s** [**September order**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/epic-games-v-apple-judge-reaches-decision-.html) **saying Apple would have to allow apps to direct customers to external websites. That ruling would let app businesses circumvent Apple’s requirement to facilitate payments only inside of apps, where Apple takes up to a 30% cut. Apple is also appealing the ruling.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Because Epic Games is also appealing the nine counts it lost, it could take years before the case is resolved and Apple is forced to make any changes to iOS, the operating system for iPhones, as the two companies wrangle through the appeals process in court.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**The judge is expected to rule on Apple’s request for a stay next month.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple’s move is a surprising turnaround from its tone following the decision in September. While Apple always left open the possibility of an appeal, it portrayed the judge’s ruling as a resounding legal win for its App Store business model, which has come under fire from technology rivals, international regulators and members of the U.S. Congress.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We are very pleased with the Court’s ruling and we consider this a huge win for Apple,” Kate Adams, Apple’s lawyer, said in September following the ruling.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Friday night announcement inspired a torrent of commentary from Apple critics. They pointed out the move would preserve Apple’s App Store profits by preventing apps from using alternative payment systems. One company announced last week that it was already working on a [cheaper, web-based alternative to Apple’s app payments](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/developers-building-ways-to-skirt-apples-cut-of-in-app-purchases.html) \-- a move made possible only by the ruling that Apple is now appealing. Apple doesn’t disclose profit margins for the App Store, but it did [generate about $64 billion in gross sales in 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/apples-app-store-had-gross-sales-around-64-billion-in-2020.html).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Apple said it filed the appeal now because it faces a legal deadline this month. If Apple didn’t appeal now, it would forever lose the option, and it can always change its mind and withdraw the appeal. Apple also framed its appeal as a way to hold off a hasty business decision before the case is fully closed. The current order from the judge requires Apple to allow apps to link out to the web in December.**  
&gt;  
&gt;If the judge grants Apple the stay on the order next month, then the status quo will remain until Epic Games and Apple settle their beef. That could take years and help Apple resist more forced changes to its App Store model.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime though, there are plenty of other external legal threats to Apple’s App Store. For example, a bipartisan bill in the in the Senate would [force Apple to accept alternative in-app payments](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/bipartisan-bill-targets-apple-and-googles-ability-to-profit-from-app-stores.html). Plus, Apple is already [forced to comply with a regulatory decision from Japan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/01/apple-will-let-some-apps-guide-users-to-websites-to-make-payments-bypassing-apples-cut.html) to allow some apps to link out to websites. (The Japanese order does not apply to games, which is where most believe Apple makes the largest amount of App Store profit.)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Apple may have initially pitched the ruling in the Epic Games case as a win, but its appeal shows that it will protect its lucrative App Store model until the bitter end.**

If Russia and China are attacking will Australia, Philippines, North Korea just sit there, uncomfortably close to the conflict?

Australia will not like it, and they have voiced concern over China's increased dominance in the region. They recently purchased nuke submarines because of China - this angered France.

Using stock data going back to 1871, we show that buying stock on margin when young combined with more conservative investments when older stochastically dominates standard investment strategies—both traditional life-cycle investments and 100%-stock investments.

The expected retirement wealth is 84% higher compared to life-cycle funds and 20% higher compared to 100% stock investments. Relative to traditional life-cycle investments, the expected gain from this improved asset allocation would allow workers to retire 9 years earlier or extend their standard of living during retirement for an additional 20 years. For a worker with CRRA=2, the increased retirement consumption raises lifetime utility by 7.3%. The potential gains are substantial...

We recognize that our recommendation to begin with leverage positions goes against conventional advice. And yet, our recommendation flows directly from the basic Samuelson and Merton lifecycle savings model. It is also supported by the data. We will 2 show that following this advice leads to higher returns with lower risks. This is true both for historical data and for a variety of Monte Carlo simulations.""

Quite an interesting paper, basically it says if you're young, leveraging actually decreases risk. \*Because you're diversifying across time\*.

With occasional hops and bounces, [30 years treasury yields](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETYX?p=%5ETYX) have been on a pretty steady decline since 1985, which makes borrowing ever-cheaper. 

Treasury secretary Yellen said that even though the amount of debt relative to the economy has risen, the interest burden - the amount the Treasury pays to service its debt - has not, due to lower interest rates.

- shortages due to a lack of appreciation or value for non-monetary contributions in the workplace
- shortages due to lack of proper healthcare
- shipping labor shortages due to people not wanting to commit to another year at sea with no shore leave, because pandemic

54,investing,lowbreadth39,5 Canadian Growth Stocks To Invest In For 2022,"On September 21, the Canadian market rallied after the re-election of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals Party with the assurance that Canada’s economy would keep improving. Economic and regulatory environments have a huge influence on an economy’s performance because government policies hugely affect business operations. Investors should decide their investment strategies depending on how these government policies impact each industry and its elements.


Fiscal policy under Trudeau's Liberals Party is expected to remain loose, thus promoting businesses in general. The financial sector and renewable energy sector would have the maximum impact as the government is likely to impose a 3% tax on large banks and insurers, and might also remove fossil fuel subsidies within two years to reach a zero-emission target by 2050. Furthermore, the telecommunications industry might also witness some reforms as the government is eager to establish affordable and consumer-friendly internet and cellphone plans.

60,investing,ButtBlock,"Long term population trends, implication for real estate and other markets","Was thinking tonight about how real estate has continued to become more and more expensive, (i.e. a good investment) over the past 70 years. However that price run up has been predicated both on the largest population explosion in human history, as well as artificial construction of supply, by NIMBYs and zoning laws in many parts of the world. 

I’ve always assumed that, aside from occasional collapses, real estate will continue to drift upwards, perhaps not a great investment compared to other assets, but better than inflation. 

The possibility exists of long term reversal of both of these supporting trends. Zoning laws are becoming threatened due to political backlash from how unaffordable housing has become. At the same time life in general has become so unaffordable that fertility rates are now strongly below replacement values in most of the developed world. 

Can’t say anything with any certainty of course, but I think a future of continued growth of housing prices for the next century isn’t a guarantee. Sounds obvious when I write it out, but psychologically I had a deep seated assumption that the housing market was a guaranteed success long term.  Think that may require a rethink. 

If population trends down in the developed world, that’s a possible future to consider when choosing investments. Fewer people could depress real prices of stocks in general.  Kind of difficult to know what types of companies would perform well in this scenario. I suppose technology companies specializing in automation (AI and robotics) is the only market I can think of that would do well. Commodities, construction, non-durables, energy, all of those seem to be at risk from a general long-term decline in population and therefore in aggregate demand.

While we all knew tech has outperformed significantly over the past 20 years, how much its outperformed is kind of nuts.


So much so, that a 65 / 35  QQQ - Bonds Portfolio yielded higher total and risk-adjusted returns than the S&amp;P!!


Parameter
July 2007 to October 2021
Starting Balance: $10K

Best year + 32.2%
Worst year -  36.8%
Sharpe - 0.64


Whats mind blowing is this is with regular quarterly rebalancing, throwing 35% of your recurring investment into bonds every quarter (where intuitively, one would likely want to roll bond allocation into more equity during significant downturns). Which is to suggest returns could be even higher with the most basic concept of market timing (i.e., investing 90/10 into qqq in midst of 08 financial crisis). Im not talking about plucking tops and bottoms with any serious level of precision.



Why is S&amp;P still the gold standard? How many decades does tech need to outperform before people acknowledge its here to stay and will only grow? We have millenials raised on tech now becoming the largest income earners. People have been waiting for tech to ""correct"" itself again for two decades, and lost out on significant return for a perceived benefit of diversification, when the reality is that even at 65/35 QQQ  you not only beat the S&amp;P but do so with definitively less risk as measured by sharpe &amp; drawdowns.


What am I missing here?? Am I nuts for wanting my long portfolio to maybe resemble 60 QQQ / 30 Bonds / 10 S&amp;P ?",1633826562,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q4xr3o/qqq_allocation_no_brainer/

By Marc Jones

LONDON (Reuters) -  Investment bank JPMorgan has estimated that troubled Chinese property  giant Evergrande and many of its major rivals have billions of dollars  worth of off-balance sheet debt that, once added on, ramp up their  leverage ratios.

JPMorgan's China and Hong Kong property analysts  said the tactic is likely to have been used to help firms look like they  were conforming with new borrowing cap rules introduced last year, but  Evergrande's case looks the most extreme.

""Instead  of true deleveraging, we think Evergrande has shifted some of the  interest-bearing debt to off-balance sheet debt,"" JPMorgan's analysts  said. ""Commercial papers, wealth management products and perpetual  capital securities, etc, which are not officially counted as debt.""

They  estimated Evergrande's ""net gearing,"" as debt as a ratio of a firm's  equity is known, was at least 177% at the end of the first half of the  year, instead of the 100% its accounts reported.

""It is possible  that the real gearing could be even higher, as data on some off-balance  sheet debt is not publicly available,"" JPMorgan added, saying the  ""disguised"" debt as it called it added up to 55% of Evergrande's overall  debt.

Other major firms whose gearing levels were likely to be  higher than formally reported included R&amp;F Properties at 139% versus  the 123%, Sunac China Holdings at 138% versus 87% reported and Country  Garden at 76% versus 50% reported.

91,investing,thebabaghanoush,"September’s jobs creation comes up short with gain of just 194,000 vs 500,000 expected","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/september-jobs-report.html

The U.S. economy created jobs at a much slower-than-expected pace in September, a pessimistic sign about the state of the economy though the total was held back substantially by a sharp drop in government employment.

Nonfarm payrolls rose by just 194,000 in the month, compared with the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000, the Labor Department reported Friday. The unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, better than the expectation for 5.1% and the lowest since February 2020.

The headline number was hurt by a 123,000 decline in government payrolls, while private payrolls increased by 317,000.

The drop in the jobless rate came as the labor force participation rate edged lower, meaning more people who were sidelined during the coronavirus pandemic have returned to the workforce. A more encompassing number that also includes so-called discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons declined to 8.5%, also a pandemic-era low.

“This is quite a deflating report,” said Nick Bunker, economic research director at job placement site Indeed. “This year has been one of false dawns for the labor market. Demand for workers is strong and millions of people want to return to work, but employment growth has yet to find its footing.”

Nevertheless, markets reacted little to the news, with Dow futures around flat for the morning and government bond yields mixed as investors digested what was a mixed bag of a report.

Despite the weak jobs total, wages increased sharply. The monthly gain of 0.6% pushed the year-over-year rise to 4.6% as companies use wage increases to combat the persistent labor shortage. The available workforce declined by 183,000 in September and is 3.1 million shy of where it was in February 2020, just before the pandemic was declared.

“Labor shortages are continuing to put severe upward pressure on wages ... at a time when the return of low-wage leisure and hospitality workers should be depressing the average,” wrote Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

Leisure and hospitality again led job creation, adding 74,000 positions, as the unemployment rate for the sector plunged to 7.7% from 9.1%. Professional and business services contributed 60,000 while retail increased by 56,000.

Job gains were spread across a variety of other sectors: Transportation and warehousing (47,000), information (32,000), social assistance (30,000), manufacturing (26,000), construction (22,000) and wholesale trade (17,000).

Local government education jobs fell by 144,000, which may have been due to seasonal adjustments in the numbers, according to Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC.

The survey week of Sept. 12 came just as Covid cases were peaking in the U.S. The delta variant spread since has cooled, with cases most recently dropping below an average of 100,000 a day.

Unemployment for Blacks fell to 7.9% from 8.8%, due largely to a drop to 66% from 66.7% in the labor force participation rate for males.

There was some good news in Friday’s report from previous months.

July’s already-strong gains were revised higher by 38,000 to 1.0913 million, while August’s big letdown also was revised up, to 366,000 from the initially reported 235,000.

The employment-to-population level increased to 58.7%, its highest since March 2020.

The report comes at a critical time for the economy, with recent data showing solid consumer spending despite rising prices, growth in the manufacturing and services sector, and surging housing costs.

Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely. The central bank recently has indicated it’s ready to start pulling back on some of the extraordinary help it has provided during the pandemic crisis, primarily because inflation has met and exceeded the Fed’s 2% goal.

However, officials have said they see the jobs market still well short of full employment, a prerequisite for interest rate hikes. Market pricing currently indicates the first rate increase likely will come in November 2022.

“After looking like almost a done deal, today’s jobs number has thrown expectations for tapering into disarray. The Fed doesn’t seem to need much to convince it that tapering should begin imminently, but at just 194,000, jobs numbers are suggesting that the labor market is further from hitting the substantial progress goal than they expected,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.",1633705496,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q3zlhy/septembers_jobs_creation_comes_up_short_with_gain/

11,investing,stillness0072,$CCXI a stock that was in the high $60's just got FDA approval,"ChemoCentryx, Inc., (Nasdaq: CCXI), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TAVNEOS (avacopan), an orally administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor, as an adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis (also known as ANCA-associated vasculitis or ANCA vasculitis), specifically granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (the two main forms of ANCA vasculitis), in combination with standard therapy. ANCA-associated vasculitis is a systemic autoimmune disease in which over-activation of the complement system further activates neutrophils, leading to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. This results in organ damage and failure, with the kidney as the major target, and is often fatal if not treated.

\- ADVERTISEMENT -

“Today is a momentous day in the history of ChemoCentryx; the culmination of decades of effort aimed at offering new hope to patients with this and other debilitating and deadly diseases,” said Thomas J. Schall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of ChemoCentryx. “We look forward to making TAVNEOS available to clinicians and patients in the next few weeks. We thank the Agency for their collaboration and consideration and we are also immensely grateful to the pioneering scientists, clinicians and patients who believed in the promise of TAVNEOS and who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality, along with my dedicated and talented colleagues at ChemoCentryx.”

“I am excited that our work has helped lead to the first-in-a-decade approval of a medicine for ANCA-associated vasculitis. This is an important step forward in the treatment of this disease,” said the trial’s co-primary academic investigator Peter A. Merkel, MD, MPH, the Chief of Rheumatology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Director of the international Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium, and consultant to ChemoCentryx. “Patients will now have access to a new class of medication that provides beneficial effects for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis.”

“The vasculitis community is elated that TAVNEOS is now approved, bringing a much-needed new treatment option to patients living with this devastating disease,” said Joyce Kullman, Executive Director, Vasculitis Foundation. “There is a significant unmet need in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis, with current therapies often leading to serious, even fatal, side effects and a diminished quality of life. We believe new therapies like TAVNEOS may offer a brighter future for these patients.”

TAVNEOS is the first FDA approved orally-administered inhibitor of the complement C5a receptor. The approval in ANCA-associated vasculitis was supported by the results of the pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial, which were highlighted in the February 2021 edition of *The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).* The ADVOCATE trial of TAVNEOS was a global, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, double-dummy Phase III trial of 330 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis in 20 countries. Eligible study subjects were randomized to receive either rituximab or cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine/mycophenolate) and either TAVNEOS (avacopan) or study-supplied oral prednisone. Subjects in both treatment groups could also receive non-protocol glucocorticoids if needed. The study met its primary endpoints of disease remission at 26 weeks and sustained remission at 52 weeks, as assessed by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, or BVAS. The study demonstrated superiority to a prednisone-based standard of care with respect to sustained remission at 52 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (≥5% of patients and higher in the TAVNEOS group vs. prednisone group) were: nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, dizziness, blood creatinine increase, and paresthesia.

ChemoCentryx has developed TAVNEOS Connect, a patient support program designed to assist patients who are prescribed TAVNEOS. To learn more about TAVNEOS Connect, or TAVNEOS, visit www.TAVNEOS.com.

ChemoCentryx is responsible for the discovery and development of TAVNEOS (avacopan) and owns the commercial rights to the drug in the United States. ChemoCentryx's Kidney Health Alliance with Vifor Pharma provides Vifor Pharma with exclusive rights to commercialize TAVNEOS in markets outside of the U.S.

TAVNEOS (avacopan) is also approved for the treatment of microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (the two main forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis) in Japan. The regulatory decision in Europe following the European Medicines Agency (EMA) review is expected by the end of 2021.

**INDICATION**  
TAVNEOS (avacopan) is indicated as an adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis \[GPA\] and microscopic polyangiitis \[MPA\]) in combination with standard therapy including glucocorticoids. TAVNEOS does not eliminate glucocorticoid use.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**  


**CONTRAINDICATIONS**  
Serious hypersensitivity to avacopan or to any of the excipients

**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**  
Hepatotoxicity: Serious cases of hepatic injury have been observed in patients taking TAVNEOS, including life-threatening events. Obtain liver test panel before initiating TAVNEOS, every 4 weeks after start of therapy for six months and as clinically indicated thereafter. Monitor patients closely for hepatic adverse reactions, and consider pausing or discontinuing treatment as clinically indicated (refer to section 5.1 of the Prescribing Information). TAVNEOS is not recommended for patients with active, untreated and/or uncontrolled chronic liver disease (e.g., chronic active hepatitis B, untreated hepatitis C, uncontrolled autoimmune hepatitis) and cirrhosis. Consider the risk and benefit before administering this drug to a patient with liver disease.

Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions: Cases of angioedema occurred in a clinical trial, including one serious event requiring hospitalization. Discontinue immediately if angioedema occurs and manage accordingly. TAVNEOS must not be re-administered unless another cause has been established.

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: Hepatitis B reactivation, including life threatening hepatitis B, was observed in the clinical program. Screen patients for HBV. For patients with evidence of prior infection, consult with physicians with expertise in HBV and monitor during TAVNEOS therapy and for six months following. If patients develop HBV reactivation, immediately discontinue TAVNEOS and concomitant therapies associated with HBV reactivation, and consult with experts before resuming.  


Serious Infections: Serious infections, including fatal infections, have been reported in patients receiving TAVNEOS. The most common serious infections reported in TAVNEOS group were pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Avoid use of TAVNEOS in patients with active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits before initiating TAVNEOS in patients with chronic infection, at increased risk of infection or who have been to places where certain infections are common.

**ADVERSE REACTIONS**  
The most common adverse reactions (≥5% of patients and higher in the TAVNEOS group vs. prednisone group) were: nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, dizziness, blood creatinine increased, and paresthesia.

**DRUG INTERACTIONS**  
Avoid coadministration of TAVNEOS with strong and moderate CYP3A4 enzyme inducers. Reduce TAVNEOS dose when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors to 30 mg once daily. Monitor for adverse reactions and consider dose reduction of certain sensitive CYP3A4 substrates.

&amp;#x200B;

**About** **TAVNEOS™** **(avacopan)**  
TAVNEOS (avacopan), approved by the FDA as an adjunctive treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis, is a first-in-class, orally-administered small molecule that employs a novel, highly targeted mode of action in complement-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. While the precise mechanism in ANCA vasculitis has not been definitively established, TAVNEOS, by blocking the complement 5a receptor (C5aR) for the pro-inflammatory complement system fragment known as C5a on destructive inflammatory cells such as blood neutrophils, is presumed to arrest the ability of those cells to do damage in response to C5a activation, which is known to be the driver of ANCA vasculitis. TAVNEOS’s selective inhibition of only the C5aR leaves the beneficial C5a pathway through the C5L2 receptor functioning normally.

ChemoCentryx is also developing TAVNEOS for the treatment of patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and Lupus Nephritis (LN). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted TAVNEOS orphan drug designation for ANCA-associated vasculitis and C3G. The European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation for TAVNEOS for the treatment of two forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis: microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis), as well as for C3G.

**About ANCA-Associated Vasculitis**  
ANCA-associated vasculitis is a systemic disease in which over-activation of the complement pathway further activates neutrophils, leading to inflammation and destruction of small blood vessels. This results in organ damage and failure, with the kidney as the major target, and is fatal if not treated. Currently, treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis consists of courses of non-specific immuno-suppressants (cyclophosphamide or rituximab), combined with the administration of daily glucocorticoids (steroids) for prolonged periods of time, which can be associated with significant clinical risk including death from infection.

45,investing,iKickdaBass,Why investors should not be worried about the expansion of the money supply causing inflation in four easy charts.," 

**Introduction**: There has been a lot of discussion as to the increase in money supply and inflation. Most seem to think that an increase in M2 inevitably leads to inflation in prices of goods and services. This couldn't be further from the truth. There was previously a strong correlation between the two up until 1990. From then on, the correlation has reversed and is negative. There is now a much stronger relationship between increases in the money supply and decreases in the velocity of money, meaning that money is not moving through the economy as it once did. This means that increases in the money supply are not getting spent. And as we all know, money must be spent to cause inflation. This is why economists are not overly concerned about the recent rapid rise in the money supply causing inflation.

So here are the four easy charts:

1. This [first chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=809733064&amp;format=image) shows the correlation between the adjusted money supply and inflation. The M2 money supply is adjusted by subtracting real GDP. This amounts to the excess money beyond what is needed to grow real GDP. This has the strongest correlation with inflation. Inflation is measured by the implicit GDP price deflator, which measures the actual items that were spent in the year vs. a previous year's base price. You can use PCE or CPI, but the relationship is very similar. (Also I'm using an 8 year moving average because this gives the strongest correlation between the two variables. The correlation is very weak in concurrent periods, and gets a little stronger using 2 and 4 year moving averages.) You can see from this chart that the correlation was very strong from 1968, the first year of the 8 year moving average, through the end of 1990. R = 0.95 and R\^2 = 0.90. This indicates that 90% of changes in inflation can be explained by the changes in the adjusted money supply. This strong relationship has lead the general public to believe that the two variables are inherently related: That is, that the expansion of the adjusted money supply inevitably leads to inflation.
2. The [second chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=2061624488&amp;format=image) shows the correlation from 1991-2021. You can clearly see that the relationship reversed. R= -0.50 R\^2 = 0.25. This indicates that the rate of inflation decreases as the adjusted money supply increases. It shows a moderate to weak relationship in which the increase in the adjusted money supply explains about 25% of the decrease in the rate of inflation. This can probably be explained by the fact that the money supply has seen its largest increases in periods when the economy was in recession and prices were falling. Needless to say, you can see that the former relationship between these two variables does NOT exist anymore and hasn't for 30 years!
3. This [third chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=997615969&amp;format=image) shows the relationship between changes in adjusted money supply and changes in the velocity of money from 1960-1990. The velocity of money is the frequency of monetary transactions in the economy. You can clearly see that the relationship is negative, as the adjusted money supply increases, the number of transactions decreases. R = -0.63 R\^2 = 0.40. This indicates that 40% of the decrease in the velocity of money can be explained by the increase in the adjusted money supply. This is a moderately strong relationship.
4. This [last chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=946401508&amp;format=image) shows the correlation of adjusted money supply and the velocity of money from 1991-2021. R= -0.98 R\^2 = 0.97. This indicates the strengthening of the relationship between increases in adjusted money supply and decreases in the velocity of money. You can clearly see that the more money that is pushed into the economy the less frequent that money gets spent.

**So where is all this money going if it is not going into goods and services?** Economist largely believe that increases in the money supply probably inflate assets, including real estate, stocks, bonds and all other capital and financial assets. PE ratios have been on the rise for 30 years now. The average TTM PE ratio from 1928-1990 was 13.8 times. Since then it is 21x. The 10-year treasury yield from 1928-1990 averaged 5.17%. Since then 4.19%, and 3% in the last 20 years. The are further examples, but I think you can see that the decoupling of the money supply and inflation has probably benefited asset prices.

**TLDR**: Increasing the money supply does NOT lead to inflation in products and services like it once did. It now results in a lower velocity of money, more savings and higher asset prices.",1633658717,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q3o1f6/why_investors_should_not_be_worried_about_the/

[Zen Graphene Business Execution Plans for 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/powuln/zen_graphene_business_execution_plans_for_2022/) Sept. 15th

These all contain very relevant info, but some may be outdated at this time.

There is virtually no institutional ownership, a **measly 0.03%**. The **insiders own \~6%** with largest being CEO Greg Fenton for 2.5 mil shares. This is in all aspects, a retail supported stock. 99.3 million shares if fully diluted. That leaves 93 million shares being represented by people like you and me. Francis Dube, CEO from 2019-2020 was an activist shareholder that helped remove the terrible previous management in 2018 and pushed the R&amp;D development and continues to be a face for the company. Greg Fenton, CEO, has been purchasing massively from the market over the past years. This year he bought $500k in shares, while his salary is only $137k.

It is currently classified as a Mining stock, with the Albany deposit being the primary focus. This is dead wrong, as they have been in R&amp;D for Graphene applications for the past 3 years. Just 3 weeks ago, Sept. 22nd, they announced commercial success of their Healthcare direction as Health Canada approved their antipathogen compound coated mask, 99.99% efficacy against viruses, bacteria, and fungus. They are available for order, shipping TBD since production will primarily come online toward November with majority of product going to high priority areas like Hospitals, and nursing homes. [vitalhealthsupplies.ca](https://vitalhealthsupplies.ca/home/).

Expects to reach a production capacity toward 9-10 billion in coating equivalent for masks come November, which could go to use on HVAC filters, gloves, and high-touch surfaces as these applications seek approval in 2022. Currently, management estimates they will receive earnings of $0.03-$0.06/mask. Global mask usage is estimated to remain toward 930 billion masks per year or similarly elevated levels for the foreseeable future. If they were to capture just 1% of the current mask market,

**they could see** ***$270-$540*** **mil** **in 2022**, as EPS, ***$3-$5, the current stock price.*** Giving me a ***PT for later 2022 of $40*** or more from P/E projectability alone and disregarding any other potentials for the new year. The upside is immense.

They are an IP-development company and have many commercially viable products, such as fuel additives, antiviral,bacterial,fungal medicine (of which there is no other), rapid detection kit for bodily fluids &amp; any pathogen + certain cancers, various other applications such as:

&gt;3D conductive filaments for a variety of applications, graphene quantum dot synthesis and applications, graphene synthesis, upscaling recycled plastics, magnetic filament fabrication

from [Zen Graphene Business Execution Plans for 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/powuln/zen_graphene_business_execution_plans_for_2022/)

There are massive changes coming, and management is very transparent with their plans. It's hard not to be optimistic when everything is laid out in front of you, while management outwardly expresses that they are undervalued.. and I tend to agree. There is little investor exposure, due to it being listed as a mining stock. Tech/healthcare followers would be far more interested. Uplistings to NASDAQ/TSX are expected later this year/2022. It has been stated by management, that institutions in the U.S. simply cannot invest in ZEN due to it being on the pink sheets, Institutional ownership, again is at 0.03%. There is significant interest by these institutions, and I anticipate Uplistings to be a catalyst of their own due to the liquidity increase.

What is it worth when they offer a extremely effective solution to air quality for personal protection and passive filtration?

When they offer a potential medicine that kills bacteria, viruses, and fungus?

When they offer rapid-aptamer fluid derived tests for virtually every pathogen?

$1 billion?

$5 billion?

$10 billion?

It definitely isn't worth $500 million, with one of these opportunities alone.

On possible upcoming 1-2 month releases:

* foreign agreements for approved product or other contracts,
* TSX uplisting, with voluntary de-listing from TSXV
* TSXV authorizing ZEN for change of business from mining to science, healthcare or industrial company, typically a change of business takes around 2 months
* corrosion resistant coating
* updates on antimicrobial,viral,fungal treatment, human trials TBA
* FDA process for U.S. approvals over 2-5 months, probably faster with process in Canada completed
* regulatory decision of Rapid aptamer saliva test for Covid and her variants, 6 months for full platform of most pathogens

The first thing I found while this up was [Forge Global](https://forgeglobal.com/forge-markets/), a company that basically sells employ option shares of private companies, but they had tight requirements such as over $1 net worth and rigid terms for holding (12 months post-IPO). [Cap light](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/is-buying-and-selling-short-positions-in-private-companies-next-this-fintech-startup-is-banking-on-it/), another start-up that trades equity derivatives for pre-IPO securities, solved the issue with holding period, but had the same issues with net worth.   


In the crypto verse, I found tokens of stocks by Mirror, FTX and Bittrex, so no issues with holding or minimum net worth, but they're simply mirroring existing markets, so no pre IPO stuff. The closest thing I found to invest/ trade in private companies was [prepo](https://simulator.prepo.io/), but they're not live yet.

71,investing,ShotBot,THESIS: Why I'm long term bearish for Coinbase stock under their current business model.,"1. **Race to the bottom on fees will kill Coinbase**: Coinbase makes most of their revenue on trading fees. The problem is that fee revenue will slowly decline over time, as more competition comes in that offers less fees steal customers away. A new app called [Strike](https://strike.me/) offers Bitcion trading at 0 fees (technically not 0, but less than a penny per trade). Coinbase will eventually need to evolve it's business model to stay competitive with companies like Strike.
2. **Morally questionable VC investing will lead to regulation**: Coinbase is doing some really slimy things with the tokens they list, and it will ultimately be their downfall. For those who are unaware, Coinbase has a VC arm called *Coinbase Ventures*. Basically, Coinbase buys up these early presales of these worthless tokens, brings these obscure tokens to market by listing them on their exchange and then dumps these tokens on retail investors at crazy valuations. Regulators will see this morally repugnant behavior and crack down on it.
3. **Most of the tokens on Coinbase will be retrospectively classified as securities**: Gary Gensler has said that ""Every ICO is a Security"", which makes the majority of tokens listed on the platform securities, including the second largest coin, Etheruem. Classifying them as securities means that Coinbase must legally delist them.
4. **Bitcoin ETF will steal the majority of volume away:** Grayscale has announced that they are looking to convert *all of* their funds into crypto ETFs, not just Bitcion. Meaning, you will see every altcoin all have their own ETF. So, at some point, you must ask, what's the point in using Coinbase if all of the coins are going to have their own ETF tickers?",1633640958,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q3iqvv/thesis_why_im_long_term_bearish_for_coinbase/

I was recently called by a broker in NYC who said his firm is the first to securitize artwork, i.e.,  blue chip paintings. He said that it's an asset class that, until now, only the ultra-wealthy could afford. He says that, overall, it's outperformed every other asset class like stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.

He said what they do is buy paintings by established artists, form a LLC for each painting, then sell shares of that LLC to common folks like me for as little as $16K (he was willing to go as low as $8K for me to dip my toe in the water). He said it's just like real estate with comparable sales to tell us the value of each painting.

$MCUR:  MDMA for female sexual dysfunction. Low sex drive is not a pathology in  itself, but the condition can  become problematic when it triggers  significant levels of personal  distress, [which can involve](https://obgyn.coloradowomenshealth.com/health-info/conditions/hypoactive-sexual-desire-disorder) sadness, a sense of grief, and feelings of incompetence, loss and frustration.

According  to MindCure, the hypoactive sexual desire disorder affects  “10% of  adult women and 14% of premenopausal adult women, all reporting  that  their low desire results in a state of distress.”

**In the U.S. the condition is believed to affect an estimated 9.5 million premenopausal women.**

Ramsden  says there are currently two available drugs in the market  targeting  this indication, both of which are aimed at women’s physiology  instead  of addressing the psychological causes behind the condition.  Their  success rate **goes only about 10% above placebo**.

$OTLC:   AL-101 drug for Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD). FSD is a prevalent  problem, afflicting approximately 40% of women and there are few  available treatment options. FSD is more typical as women age, and is a  progressive and widespread condition. (Allahdadi, KJ et al. (2009)  Cardiovascular &amp; hematologicalagents in medicinalchemistry, 7(4),  260-269). There is no available drug for the treatment of FSD. HSDD is  characterized by a low sexual desire, that causes marked distress or  interpersonal difficulty, and is not due to a co-existing medical or  psychiatric condition, problems within the relationship or the effects  of a medication or other drug substance. HSDD affects approximately 5.8  million U.S. premenopausal women (1 in 10 premenopausal women). Almost  98%, approximately 5.7 million of affected premenopausal women are not  on any therapy for HSDD, either due to lack of education or lack of  therapies available. One in 10 premenopausal women have low desire with  associated distress. In June 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  approved Vyleesi (bremelanotide) to treat acquired, generalized HSDD in  premenopausal women. Currently, this is the only available drug  treatment.

However, these same people will tell me that China is going to continue to get bigger, better, richer, etc. I will say it is indisputable that the Chinese middle class is booming right now, and the will there is to invest as you go into the middle class. Granted, the Chinese prefer to invest in real estate, but they are beginning to invest in stocks. 

So, with this said - is it not common sense to then invest in say a DIDI, BABA, etc for the long term (5+ years)?

I'm fairly new to personal investing, having really only started at the end of last year. It was a great time to invest and I made a substantial (though not life-changing) amount of money that has got me hooked on being more financial prudent. I realize I'll have to pay taxes on my gains, and was wondering if it makes sense to harvest some losses, given the current stock market situation. I have most of my money right now in VTI and VXUS that I've bought steadily over the year and at loss now. I've considered selling to buy similar ETFs that are different enough to avoid a wash sale.

83,investing,Samich_Boi,FLGC: The Next Big Global Play?,"**Introduction**

Today I want to bring up one of the biggest potential plays of the 21st century. When people talk about big plays, they often include trend that have already risen to popularity. For example, the electric vehicle market. Many investors continue to speculate in potentially extremely high future revenue  electric vehicles. Why? Well, everyone and their mother understand that electric vehicles are an inevitability; that is, in the future, we will all have them! The classic example of identifying a trend before it's dominance would have been to buy EV stock before their prevalence back in as early as 2010. I'm sure you have heard comparisons before, but if you had put just $500 into Tesla as soon as it was listed back in 2010, you would have about 22 grand today. But what if you had bought it lower? As low as $5? You would have 77 grand! So why this example? Of course this is such wishful thinking right? Well, I'd like to believe that those investors who bought at $5 knew their future. They identified the EV market as a trend and ran with it, not caring whether they bought at 5 or 50. They knew the power of the EV market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Marijuana and Cannabis: A Future of Opportunity** 

I want to start by saying that the marijuana market has been one that has been talked about for a long time now. Global investors have been speculating in marijuana for a long time as many understand it's future global implications. However, right now, current marijuana stock market caps do not represent it's potential. Even investors in NIO and Tesla understand that these companies are just starting to get a global foot in the door; yet, they have been speculating the prices of these commodities for years before their importance in the global market. Why? One simple answer: legalization.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent news proves that many countries are leaning towards legalization. Efforts in several South American countries have arisen for legalization, with big legislative movements in Columbia and Panama recently. The American market is becoming increasingly lenient on cannabis with a future headed in marijuana as well, and federal legalization is currently in legislative talks with most states edging towards decriminalization. 

&amp;#x200B;

As older generations continue to pass, social stigma towards marijuana is going down. It is a matter of time before the marijuana market booms.

&amp;#x200B;

We already saw the potential of the marijuana market before. If we look at one of the biggest competitors in the American market, Tilray, we can see how price action has been so dependent on news. In May to June of this year, the entire marijuana market boomed with news about future legalization, but no major efforts were made. So what could happen if legalization WAS approved?

&amp;#x200B;

**The Global Contenders: Whose on Top?**

When taking into consideration the global marijuana market, no one is a clear leader right now. While news for many companies have come out about big deals, none of these deals have been dominant enough to actually promote enough growth that it's worth talking about. Or wait. Maybe there has been?

&amp;#x200B;

ENTER FLORA GROWTH CORPORATION. TICKER: FLGC

&amp;#x200B;

The news for this company has been good after good after good with falling prices, just what I like to see! What exactly does this mean? Big money is slowly accumulating shares. This community does not allow the posting of pictures; however, looking at the price action of FLGC, we can see that major accumulation efforts are being made at the $5 mark, just a few cents below where it is trading right now. Even the slightest drop below $5 and the price can shoot as high as 6 dollars intraday just to go right back down to 5. Shifty? Absolutely! Smart and bullish? YES! 

&amp;#x200B;

Big money wants to accumulate as much of this stock as they can, they see the future in it. Just in the past month, FLGC has signed several big moves, such as jumping into the Panama cannabis market, promoting a massive research plan with marijuana and cannabis, launching a European market campaign, and entering the American market via hemp textiles.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at production costs per gram makes FLGC look like a future monster. Flora produces marijuana at $0.06 a GRAM. For comparison, Tilray produces at $2.36 a gram and Sundial produces at $1.86 a gram.

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentals become a tricky game to argue for Flora. While their growth is incredible, they are still losing money due to large loans. Is this a problem? I don't think so. I think by the end of this year, Flora will be boasting up to 10 times their revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

I highly recommend you inspect the Flora Growth price action, news, and fundamentals.

&amp;#x200B;

**The EV example**

So here you are. Looking at tesla back in 2011, $5 a share. You have seen it get tanked from it's IPO price and you have seen it drop even lower. Why would you invest in it. You know EV will be big one day, but still decide not to because you think ""anytime will be a good time to buy in the future, i'll just buy when I know it stops going down!""

&amp;#x200B;

Get in now. The future of the weed market is now.

&amp;#x200B;

As we see more companies look to winding down property leases to increase their bottom line, there's 9.2 million jobs and $1.14 trillion in GDP potentially impacted by this shift (Source: [L.A. Times](https://www.latimes.com/b2b/cre/story/2021-06-15/commercial-development-and-operations-a-key-catalyst-for-u-s-economic-growth)).

So, the big question is what that shift looks like. There's the possibility of repurposing commercial space as retail and residential but that would take many years of rezoning, permits, retrofits, etc., and so some inefficiencies would arise, and the near term effect would still be a net decline in real estate value.

There will obviously also be some spaces retained for core staff, executive offices, meeting spaces, etc., but as the WeWork fiasco showed, the rank and file seem to be much more amenable to working from home than so-called dedicated coworking spaces.  How might this provide relief to related sectors, such as housing shortages with residential population booms? What does it do for income inequality?

I deposit a certain amount every month. I want to see how my stock picks are doing vs SO500. In Fidelity, under performance, I see a Investment rate of return (time weighted) and Personal rate of return (money weighted). There is a slight difference in two since I haven't invested all the  amount I deposit every month and am holding some cash. I have two questions. 

1. Which return should I look at when comparing against the benchmark? I think the money weighted makes more sense since I am holding some cash. 

2. How does Fidelity do the calculation for market indexes? Does their model buy/sell indexes in the same amount as my buys or my deposits? Or do they use some other method?

Last week (Thursday 09/30) the Senate and the House of reps. signed a relief bill to prevent a government shutdown. This includes hurricane relief and assistance to Afghan refugees. Biden signed it. Crisis averted. Keep in mind we've had a previous government shutdown such as the one that happened December 22 2018 - January 25 2019 of 35 days. The longest government shutdown in history. 

This boat is still not completely patched up. Lawmakers still need to raise or suspend the debt ceiling before Oct. 18 to prevent a possible default on U.S. debt that would result in job losses, economic damage and a drop in the stock market.

Icahn's roughly 9% stake in Netflix rose in value to over $1.7 billion by late 2013.

11,investing,Connorvo,I scraped every CEO Performance Grant in 2017. Does copying them beat the market? The early results are positive!,"I scraped every new performance grant CEOs received in 2017 to see if copying those trades would beat the market. The initial results are very promising (12-25% ɑlpha on average depending on the timeframe), but more research needs to be done!

# How it works:

I wrote a python script that scraped every single Form 4 filed in 2017. It was only looking for filings that matched the below criteria:

1. The grant was a Performance Grant. Performance Grants are used to reward executives with stock only if they reach certain performance targets (the listing is when the targets are set, not when the targets are achieved)
2. The Performance Grant targets were for the stock to reach specified price targets. This means that the executive would receive stock ***only*** if the stock hit certain price targets during the given timeframe
3. The executive receiving the grant was a CEO or President.
4. The grant was not regularly scheduled (i.e. it wasn’t a grant they would receive every year). FIltering these out makes it more likely that the grant was given because the CEO and Board of Directors have confidence that the stock can reach the price targets.

# Overall Results

These kinds of grants don’t happen very often, there were only 9 of them in 2017, but they did indeed beat the market.

Of the 9 stocks that were found, all of them peaked at a price more than 35% above the performance grant and 6 of them peaked up more than 100% in the 3 years following the grant.

The below table is the average returns by months since the performance grant for the SPY and the stocks I found.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking a slightly closer look at “Max Returns” in the table below, we can see it took anywhere from 141 days to 1088 days for the stocks to reach their max return since the grant. The average was \~700 days, meaning it takes about 2 years for most of the stocks to hit their peak.

You will also see that 6 of the 9 stocks reached their performance grant targets. 2 of the 3 stocks that didn’t reach their targets had insanely high targets of 160% and 260% stock returns and both of the stocks had well over 100% returns. The other target that wasn’t reached had a 58% target but was the worst-performing stock

This grant only had one vesting date, February 6, 2020, but the grant would vest if it hit the price targets at any point between the grant date and February 6, 2020. The stock had vesting targets at $11, $14, and $18. The stock fell about 14% over the next 2.5 months before then popping up to $10.20 (37% return) about 5 months after the grant date. The stock then had a looooong fall for the next \~1.5 years until February 6, 2020. The stock recovered and reached all the way up to $15 after COVID, but the performance grant had already expired so they never received any of the awards.

The grant could begin vesting immediately and they had 2.5 years to reach the goal. The stock price immediately started going up after the performance grant and reached a local maximum of $10.55 (85% return) 4 months after the initial grant before spending the next year and a half going down to below $7. This grant was an all-or-nothing grant where the price had to reach $16 within 2.5 years to vest. It never reached that goal but maxed out at $12.53 (120% return) about 2 years after the initial grant.

# FAQs / Concerncs

***What is a Form 4?***

A Form 4 is filed any time an executive at a public company buys, sells, or is granted stock. They are required to file with the SEC within 3 days of taking the action

***Why did you pick 2017?***

Most performance grants have a timeline that is 3 years or shorter (though some are up to 5 years). 2017 ensures enough time has passed for the grant to actually play out

***Where did you get the data?***

The SEC has a database (EDGAR) that lets you scrape all of the info from all of the SEC filings

***Why did you pick the timeframes you chose (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months)?***

No particular rhyme or reason. I felt like these gave a pretty good overview of the short, medium, and long-term returns for each grant.

***9 stocks aren’t very many***

True. The sample size is very small. I am in the process of doing the analysis for more years to increase this number, but the number will never get very large as these types of grants don't happen super often.

**This isn't adjusted for risk in any way**

This is also true. These stocks vary from small to large market cap and have different levels of volatility which can affect the returns on a risk-adjusted basis. It may be worth diving into risk adjustments at some point, but right now I want to focus on gathering more data and seeing if there are any potentially viable investment strategies around the data.

# Takeaways

I definitely think this is promising, but the hard part is putting it into action. Obviously, if we could see the future and sell at the max price for all of the stocks, we’d all make millions, but the stocks don’t all just go up and to the right.

Some of them fall before popping, some pop and then fall, some pop then fall then pop even more.

There is potentially a viable strategy involving holding the stocks until they reach some return threshold (maybe like 25%) and then letting it run with a stop-loss, but I think I need more data to build better strategies. I will work on gathering more data.",1633367676,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q19z0x/i_scraped_every_ceo_performance_grant_in_2017/

**AGOURA HILLS, Calif., Oct. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oncotelic Therapeutics, Inc. (“*****Oncotelic*****”** **or the** **“*****Company*****”) (OTCQB:OTLC),** **executed an exclusive licensing agreement on September 30, 2021, with Autotelic Inc., to license intranasal apomorphine (“*****AL-101*****”). Oncotelic intends to develop AL-101, via the fast-to-market 505(b)2 regulatory pathway, for Parkinson Disease (“*****PD*****”) and Erectile Dysfunction (“*****ED*****”), especially phosphodiesterase 5 (“*****PDE5*****”) non-responders. Oncotelic also plans to develop AL-101 as a new class of drug against Female Sexual Dysfunction (“*****FSD*****”), including Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (“*****HSDD*****”). AL-101 has shown a favorable safety and efficacy profile and is phase 3 ready with six clinical trials completed and over 200 patients (2,200 doses) treated.**  


**“The acquisition of AL-101 brings in a product with a substantially large market potential for existing and unmet medical needs into the Company. With a substantially large number of new patients being diagnosed with PD, PDE5, ED every year and limited therapies available for FSD and HSDD, the Company believes that this acquisition has the potential to transform the Company.” said Saran Saund, CBO of Oncotelic.**

57,investing,guanciallee,A returns analysis comparing all American Mutual Funds to the top 3 American Index funds from 1990-Now,"There are a lot of disclaimers for this post that are extremely important. As a result, I have included them at the end indicated like so ^**1**. Additionally, I walk through the math so that everyone can understand the process and for people wanting to critique/question. There is a TL;DR at the end but without context, it's pretty unbelievable. 

### Sourcing Data
Every list of American Mutual funds has slight errors (even this [one](https://investexcel.net/complete-list-of-mutual-funds-across-all-international-exchanges/)). So I created a list with [Market Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/mutual-fund/list?firstLetter=A) of around 25,000 mutual fund tickers. Most mutual funds have multiple different tickers because of different shares/classes. Each class contains the same investments it's just variations on your fee structure ^**1**. So I counted only one example from each mutual fund ^**2**. This is controversial but I believe it will give the most accurate results. [This](https://imgur.com/a/BI4vCvB) example I would have kept two because there are only two mutual funds here. You shouldn't include every share/class because it will have an overrepresentation of certain mutual funds.

I used the stock history function in Excel to find the price of each ticker on the 1st of every year since 1990^**3**. If it didn't have a price I got rid of it for that particular year. For context at the beginning of 2021, I have around 6700 unique mutual funds in my list^**4**. 

###The Math
I did the following calculations for every American Mutual Fund since 1990 ^(**5** Big disclaimer). First I calculated the percent change from each first day of the year to the next first day of the year (2020 Jan 2/2019 Jan 2)-1. Many people calculate change inside of a year but I did the math for gains of a year gap instead. As long as I use the same timeframe every time the math is sound. The percent amounts might be slightly different than what is commonly publicized. Secondly, I calculated the percent change from the beginning of every year from 1990 until now ^**6** (1990-Now, 1991-Now, 1992-Now Etc.). 

I chose these two calculations because one is a very common attribute (year difference) and since most people buy and hold mutual funds for many years I wanted to see what the result would be holding for many years until now. I then calculated averages for these two distinct calculations for each year. As well as trimming 2.5% Top+Bottom and 10% Top+Bottom of mutual funds to exclude outliers and calculating a new percentage with that (keeping all 3 results for each calculation/year). 

###Index Funds
I chose S&amp;P500 (.INX) Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) and Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) and found their historical prices via Google Sheets. The same math calculations were done for the same timeframe gaps (i.e single year gaps and each year until now gaps). 

###Analysis
I started by comparing the 'each year till now' percentages for mutual funds to the three indexes. I can also calculate what percentage of mutual funds each index is higher than in each specific calculation. Here are the results from [1990-Now](https://imgur.com/a/Ga3pSNq). It becomes quite apparent that the order of best returns goes Nasdaq, S&amp;P then Dow Jones. Each Index normally beats out  90%+ of Mutual funds for each timeframe (sometimes 98%+). Even if you bought at the peak of the dot-com bubble (2000) or before the 2008 crash, each index would still beat the overwhelming majority of Mutual funds from that same time frame. If you knew to buy any index in the '90s it's a slaughter. 


Looking at only this data doesn't take into account a random great year for an index fund. As well there is a common notion that Mutual funds might not gain much but they shield you from losses. Let's address that by diving into the other calculation I did with the percent change from a year to the next year. 


Here is [1990-Now](https://imgur.com/a/wSEychd). Red cells indicate when an index is lower than the average mutual fund from that year. The results are when the indexes are down the average mutual fund is also very much down (Out of the 8 times S&amp;P closed negative since 1990 4 times it still outperformed the average mutual fund). There has never been a year where any index was negative yet the average mutual fund was positive. The indexes are usually beating 55-90% of mutual funds every year (With them beating 90%+ many times). Dow has beaten the average yearly mutual fund return 66% of the time in the past 30 years, S&amp;P &amp; Nasdaq being 80%. The dot-com bubble is the exception to the stellar performance where a difference between index funds and mutual funds is notable.

###Conclusion

Picking a mutual fund that somehow outperforms any index is a massive uphill battle because the indexes usually beat 55-90% of mutual funds every year (with them beating 90%+ many times). Normally you hold mutual funds for many years, so even if you succeed in choosing a winner one particular year you will still eventually lag behind the index funds. The longer timeframe the more likely (Index funds beating 92%+ of mutual funds over time is the norm)

You can make a lot of observations from this data and that's what I am going for. Make your own conclusions but keep in mind most statistics relating to the mutual fund world are not primary sources. Most of the time people are trying to convince you to buy Mutual Fund XYZ. This post is primary research where you could easily replicate my findings. 

The biggest flaw to this data is the fact that we've been in a record bull market which means aggressive investments look better in hindsight. That's why looking at both calculations I did is important, so you can see a clearer picture. You could easily do much more math to find patterns before the current record bull market. For example, calculate percent changes from various timeframes such as 1990-2018, 1991-2018 or 1990-1995, 1991-1996 or 1990-1992, 1990-1993, etc. I can calculate and post some of them if people request them. This is not financial advice.


### TLDR
The overwhelming majority of mutual funds can't compete with either Dow, Nasdaq, or S&amp;P any way you slice the data. They don't come close to competing in terms of gains and still perform badly in years when the index funds perform badly (they sometimes perform even worse during these years, the dot-com bubble is the exception). You get roughly the same amount of losses but with only a slight portion of the gains. Even if you choose a mutual fund winner one year your multi-year investment will eventually lag behind the index funds by quite a lot.

As I move further back in time my original list of 6700 mutual funds shrinks every year. If I had to guess this influences my results in my post to be slightly higher returns than the truth. This is because any mutual funds that performed horribly and delisted before 2021 wouldn't be included in my math above.)

59,investing,Eloqpolma,I’m about to go heavy in mining stocks,"I’ve been investing on some physical for some time now, since I believe that this will be the period of commodities and assets. Got myself invested in some physical gold and silver, but right now that I have some little extra that I have right now, and I’m planning on putting a part of it into mining stocks. I’m still adding some physical, but I’ve been looking into some stocks recently that I want to invest in.

I’m planning to invest in Newmont ([NEM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NEM/)) because they’re among the biggest so it’s pretty safer and sure to invest in them. When big money returns to this sector, they always begin with the miners in the big indexes. Also thinking of placing some on Freeport-McMoran ([FCX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FCX/)) which is a great value stock, with it being one of the bigger players in mining. Their stocks have risen 1.16% in premarket trading.

Also looking into juniors like Lundin Gold ([LUG.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/lug.to/)). They own the [Fruta Del Norte](https://www.lundingold.com/en/fruta-del-norte/project-overview/) gold mine, and while there was a slight slowdown in production in 2020, they managed to have a production of 108,799 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of this year.

[Collective Mining](https://collectivemining.com/) ([CNL](https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/TSXV-CNL/?utm_campaign=single-quote&amp;utm_medium=widget_new&amp;utm_source=collectivemining.com)) who recently released results on about their recently discovered a high-grade silver channel sampling that they started drilling a few weeks ago. It is expected that their next results could be a bigger catalyst than their previous discovery. They are showing a lot of potential as the drillings continue. One more good thing about them is that their cash burn is also impressively low.

77,investing,Nootherids,Stock/Funds/ETF Gains: Unrealized vs Realized vs Compound [Question],"I am trying to better understand what are the best approaches to formulate several investment accounts that focus separately on short, medium, long, and retirement terms. The retirement I'm ok with as my 401k and Roth would operate with standard mutual fund principles. I am also fully aware of the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging.

What I'm trying to decipher in my head is understanding the link between the power of Compound Interest in combination to the above investment terms. I already understand the relation of compounding in the scope of dividends. You get the dividends and they get automatically reinvested, perfect. But my question here is related to stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs. I will lay out how I understand them (ignoring the concepts of dividends altogether, so let's assume none of them disburse any dividends).

Stocks: You buy at one price. The stock goes up in price accounting for your unrealized gains. You must sell your stock (at profit) to now have realized gains. Then you have to reinvest your entire investment amount, which is initial investment + realized profit, to achieve the concept of Compounding. I just don't think this seems very reasonable for a non-professional investor, am I correct in that opinion?

Mutual Funds: You buy at the current price of the fund. The fund is actively managed and buys and sells stocks as necessary. Each time it sells a stock at profit it creates a realized gain. That gain is disbursed automatically and acts as your Compounding interest. My question is does this happen regularly or sporadically? Meaning are you actually realizing a true Compounding effect here or not really?

ETFs: They are mutual funds that act like stocks. I read some places that they will auto-reinvest any dividends they disburse but I don't know how. And since they are not actively traded then holding any ETF for the long term will not create any Compounding effect, unless you play them as stocks like stated above. Am I wrong here too?

Conclusion...Gains in the market whether stocks, funds, or ETF, are always referred to as Annualized Returns. What I'm trying to grasp my head around are whether general Gains in the market are indicative of ""Simple Interest"" or ""Compound Interest""? And being that Compound Interest is so powerful from a long term perspective, should I just stop thinking about Compounding altogether (assuming I'm not looking specifically for dividend yielding investments ATM) while I'm making these decisions? I keep running calculators seeing how an investment would grow depending on variables and of course it asks what the annual interest rate is; but some ask for compounding rate and some don't. So I don't really know which I should be looking at.

Note...I am looking to invest an initial amount of roughly $5-$20k spread over 3-4 accounts for different time frames, and injecting about $2k per month (total, not each). Just so you understand that I'm not talking amounts in the hundreds of thousands here. But being that my funds are relatively limited and I don't want to make the wrong decisions, I realized that I'm getting a bit stuck in Analysis Paralysis. So I come to you fine people. TIA

Bonus Question: Are ETF prices set by the changes in supply/demand from traders like stocks are, or are they set by the index that they track? Meaning, can the index signify that the ETF should be at $50, but investor sentiment crash the ETF down to $0, like they could with a stock? Or make it skyrocket like GME? Meaning are things like technical or price action analysis what investors use to determine the price or is the price actually linked to the underlying securities and investors just ride the wave up and down?",1633317839,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q0xbhb/stockfundsetf_gains_unrealized_vs_realized_vs/

China as a country has been an economical miracle in this century. They literally created a prosperous middle class. They have created the world's second largest economy from third world.

According to the Hurun Global Rich List 2021, Greater China housed **the most billionaires worldwide in 2021**. By comparison, 696 billionaires resided in the United States.

China has emerged as the world's largest manufacturer according to the World Bank. [source](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html#_Toc12530869) 

Economic reforms and trade and investment liberalization have helped transform China into a major trading power. Chinese merchandise exports rose from $14 billion in 1979 to $2.5 trillion in 2018, while merchandise imports grew from $18 billion to $2.1 trillion. China's rapidly growing trade flows have made it **an increasingly important (and often the largest) trading partner** for many countries. According to China, it was **the largest trading partner for 130 countries in 2013**. [source](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html#_Toc12530869) 

  
Today, the country is being rocked heavily. The Evergrande debt crisis is still unravelling (other major Chinese real estate companies are drowning in debt), there is shortage in many of the manufacturing items coming out of China (computer chips, precious metals etc.), they are under international pressures/(warfare?) from the USA and others, and now they are having energy blackouts throughout the country (?!).  


The country societal problems are rearing it's head - The ruling party restricting rights, and then the one child policy is beginning show negative economic ramifications, in that, they have too much of an aging population.  


The ruling party are trying to fix all of their issues right now, wit heavy debt restructuring revamping social programs. But right now it looks like China is being rocked with a lot of issues.  


China is eyeing expansion of power - war with Taiwan and seizure of Hong Kong. What will be the economic ramifications of those events to China, and to the world? Yet to be seen.  


Now, here is my question:  


Despite the above - **China is still an economic powerhouse on the world stage**. International **Investors need China to remain as such, as China is economically intertwined**  with too many sectors in this world.   


I, personally, am  still very bullish on China long term. But since it appears, that China is, honestly, under economic upheaval.   


Should someone who admires China's economic performance;  


Buy the dip now (while much of the equities are priced low)  


or   


does an intelligent assessment demand waiting until long term (1 year-ish)  


or   
should one just avoid China as an investment as much as possible for as long as possible (at least until the dust settles with Hong Kong and Taiwan)?",1633295073,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q0qrd3/investing_in_china_outlook_in_the_short_term_or/

It’s the most Tesla has ever sold in a quarter (and for some added perspective, the company [sold 367,500 in all of 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047233/tesla-2019-deliveries-q4-record-model-3-sales)).

The company managed to deliver more vehicles once again despite the fact that major automakers saw huge drops this past quarter. General Motors, the largest automaker in the US, said [Friday morning](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/10/01/gm-sales-chip-shortage-suv/5934699001/) that it only sold 446,997 vehicles in the third quarter — a 33 percent drop from the same period last year.

Tesla has avoided similar problems in part because it has been [sourcing different semiconductors and rewriting software on the fly](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560608/tesla-q2-2021-deliveries-elon-musk) to make those chips work in place of the ones not currently available. Beyond that, the company continues to see strong sales in China, where it started making and selling vehicles in early 2020.

De-risking from East Ukraine with Sales Agreement (not yet final), stock will then trade below Cash Level, RK field is now producing but not in the books due to impairments in the past when it was still Gas","  Maybe a good play with rising Ukraine Gas prices:

KUB (CAD) / TPNEF (USD) looks even better with Ukraine Gas prices rising to 18,000 MCM (valuta is UAH). 18,000 MCM in September (Cubic Meters, Before VAT/Taxes) according to the table on the website and last quarter was an average of $6.50 MCF (Cubic Feet, After VAT/Taxes) in the MD&amp;A Q2. This was with an average 9,400 MCM (April - June) on the website. Meaning Gas prices will be up with 66% in Q3 (upcoming numbers) compared to Q2. KUB uses no hedges.

In Q2 2021 KUB made 500K USD profit. RK field with electricity was only online for half the quarter, 100K profit, but using the numbers it can be 200K USD so 250K CAD in profit. This means that the Gas business was 500K CAD profit with all 'fixed costs' included and September is more than double the Gas prices (after VAT/Taxes).

I look forward to next Quarter (Q3) with the average at 15,600 MCM (July - September) compared to 9,400 in Q2. A 66% increase.

So this should be strong earnings in Q3 and then clean books when this sales deal closes, de-risking from Eastern Ukraine. Trading below Cash and Equity (not taking into account the RK field in the books) after this deal. I believe the cash will mostly be used to further develop the RK field.

Looks to me to be trading below the cash level after this deal is finalized. RK field is not in the books.

9,investing,Market_Madness,The Fundamental Investment Types,"#**Introduction**
Everyone talks about what to invest in, but they often skip a step when talking to beginners. What to invest in starts with knowing what is available. Here are the fundamental investment types I will be covering today:


* Stocks – fractional ownership of a company sold in the form of shares
* Bonds – a loan to a company or government that will pay interest in the future
* Commodities – a raw material or agricultural product that can be bought or sold
* Mutual Funds and ETFs  – containers holding many stocks, bonds, or commodities


Each of these have their own unique set of attributes and uses. They’re differentiated based on risk, specialization, and ease of use. I might go into these details in the future, but for now I want to start at the very beginning. 

#**Stocks**
Let’s say you own a business. You currently only have one location but would like to open another. You know your business is worth about $1 million dollars and that it costs $100,000 to open a new store. You decide to create 10,000 shares and attempt to sell them for $100 each. Each share represents a 0.01% ownership stake in the company. Let’s say you sell 2,000 of the shares. Now you own 8,000 shares and the person or people you sold the shares to own 2,000. This means you own 80% of the company and the others own 20%. They paid you $200,000 for those shares which you can now use to open two new stores. 

So why did the people in the example buy $200,000 worth of your business’s stock? People buy stocks for two primary reasons. The first is that they expect the business to do well. A business that does well will grow and increase the value of its shares. This is called capital appreciation. If you go ahead and builds two more stores that generate the same income as the first, the value of the business will have roughly tripled. The $200,000 that was invested could now easily be worth $600,000. On the other hand, what if you tried to open two new stores and they both failed? Everyone would see that you’re bad at running this business and those shares might only be worth $100,000 now. The second reason is to collect dividend payments from the business. A dividend is when a company takes a portion of its earnings and pays them out to its shareholders. These are more common among older well established businesses that have consistent income.

Stocks are most commonly traded on stock exchanges. The United States is home to the two largest exchanges in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq Stock Market. To buy or sell stocks yourself on the exchanges you need to go through a brokerage. This might sound like a daunting process but can usually be set up in less than 15 minutes. Once you have an account set up and money deposited buying and selling shares is nearly instantaneous. 

#**Bonds**
When you need to make a large purchase like a new car you don’t typically pay it all up front. You might not have enough money at the moment or want a way to spread the purchase out over time. To do this you get a loan. Let’s say you want to buy a $20,000 car. You spend $4,000 on the down payment and agree to pay the rest over the next three years. You get to take the car home today because the loan pays the dealership the remaining amount owed. In return for lending you this money the bank is going to charge interest as you pay the loan back. Let’s assume the interest rate is 3% per year. At this rate you’ll end up paying the bank back about $16,751. The additional $751 is their payment for taking on the risk of loaning you that money.

Bonds and loans have a lot in common. They’re both used to finance expensive purchases, have interest rates, and cover a set period of time. There are some differences though. The car loan was paid off in monthly payments over the course of three years. Each monthly payment paid some of the interest as well as some of the initial $16,000 principal. Let’s say you’re the bank. Instead of writing a car loan you use the money to buy a bond worth $16,000 at the same 3% interest rate over the same three year period. As the holder of the bond you would be entitled to interest rate payments, twice per year, for three years. Each semiannual payment would be 1.5% of $16,000 or $240. After three years the bond would mature, you would receive your last interest payment, and you would receive your entire $16,000 back.

Let’s take a look at how stocks and bonds compare. Both of them can be used to raise money, but they do so in significantly different ways. When you buy stock you are buying a fractional ownership in the business. You do not get your initial investment back unless the company pays dividends, or you sell your shares and give up ownership. Bonds can also be used to raise money, but they do not offer any ownership. When a company sells bonds it knows that it will have to pay them back in the future which can be costly. When it sells stock its current shareholders lose some of their ownership and therefore value. Let’s say there are 100 shares of company XYZ and they decided to issue 20 more. Previously every share was worth 1% of the company, now every share is only worth 0.83% of the company. This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding what stocks and bonds are and how they compare to each other. 

#**Commodities**
Stocks and bonds are each considered to be an asset class. An asset class is a group of investments that have similar characteristics and have to follow the same regulations. Stock in Apple is not the exact same as stock in Visa, but they serve the same purpose, can be traded the same way, and follow the same rules. The same can be said about bonds. A bond that takes seven years to mature is not the exact same as one that takes ten years, but they are both going to be structured the same. The third asset class we will be covering are commodities.

A commodity is a raw material or primary agricultural product. These products are essentially the same regardless of where they come from. Copper, gold, oil, iron, and lumber are all examples of raw material commodities. Corn, soybeans, meat, and milk are all agricultural commodities. There may be minor fluctuations in quality, but in order to be traded on exchanges they need to meet a minimum requirement. These materials form the foundation of almost everything our economy produces. 

Unlike with stocks or bonds, commodities are not used as a way to raise money. They’re traded as a way to protect the producer from risk. Let’s say you can grow 10,000 bushels of wheat in a good year. You would like to get at least $8 per bushel once it’s harvested. What happens if there is a perfect year for crops and everyone else has produced more than expected. This increase in supply pushes the price lower because buyers have more to choose from. The price per bushel is now only $5. In this situation you would only earn 63% as much as you were forecasting which can be hard to handle as a business. In order to protect yourself from this situation you might want to create a contract with a wheat buyer on an exchange. This contract could include you agreeing to sell your wheat for $7 per bushel at the end of the summer. This is less than the $8 you are hoping for, but it will be guaranteed. Assuming the person buying the contract was also expecting wheat to be worth $8 per bushel, they will see this as a good deal. When prices for materials are known in advance it’s easier to budget and plan which is a benefit for both parties. 

Odds are you aren’t looking to buy or sell massive quantities of wheat, or any other raw materials. If you’re looking at investing in commodities it’s probably going to be in oil, gold, or common metals like copper. Thankfully you don’t need to be directly trading contracts with the producers to do this. There are shares that can be bought and sold like stocks on a stock exchange. Each share represents a fixed amount of the commodity, such as an ounce of gold or a barrel of oil. The primary reason people buy commodities is to protect themselves from inflation. This works because as the price of things increase, the price of the raw materials must also increase. 

#**Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds**
Now that you have an idea of what the three most popular asset classes are, let’s take a look at a couple of the tools associated with them. Mutual funds and ETFs are both collections of stocks, bonds, or commodities that can be traded. Instead of hand selecting companies, bonds, or commodities these collections allow you to purchase a fraction of many of them all at once. 

The S&amp;P 500 is an index that tracks 500 of the largest companies in the United States. It’s often used as a general gauge for the US economy. If the economy is doing well and growing, this index will also be growing. Instead of having to purchase shares in all 500 businesses by hand there are numerous ETFs that will do that for you. The most popular one has a ticker name of SPY. When you buy a share of SPY, 5.9% of your money is being put in Apple stock, 2.29% is put into Facebook stock, and so on. The larger the company the larger the fraction of your money they get. This is called a market cap weighed fund. 

SPY is an ETF which means you can buy or sell it at any time with ease. FXAIX also covers the companies of the S&amp;P 500, but it is a mutual fund. What is the difference between the two? Well there’s not much. The most noticeable one is that mutual funds cannot be traded throughout the day. They can only be purchased at the end of the day. Although not a rule, mutual funds are much more likely to be actively managed than an ETF. Active management means there is a professional portfolio manager in charge of selecting when to buy or sell the things the mutual fund holds. ETFs are much more likely to be passively managed. This means they track a set list of stocks automatically.

#**Conclusion**
These four categories make up a vast majority of investments. Being able to understand how each of them work is crucial in making your own investment choices. Hopefully this post was able to bring up even more questions than it answered if you're new. Now that you know what the major fundamental asset classes are you might ask yourself why you would choose one over the other. This was touched on, but I never went into detail on the risk, return, history, or combination of them. All of these ideas warrant their own posts which may come in the future.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm

Rivian Automotive, a company developing electric vehicles, including commercial delivery vans for Amazon, filed for an initial public offering on Friday. The company aims to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “RIVN.”

Its paperwork shows a $994 million net loss on zero revenue in the first six months of 2021. In 2020 the company’s net loss came to $1.02 billion.

The company wrote in its filing, “We are a development stage company and have not generated material revenue to date. Vehicle production and deliveries began in September 2021.” Rivian beat Tesla, GM and Ford to the market with an electric pickup, the R1T, which has received glowing early reviews. The company plans to launch a seven-passenger SUV called the R1S in December, it said in the filing.

CEO RJ Scaringe, who has a Ph.D. from the Sloan Automotive Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded Rivian in 2009. The company is based in Irvine, Calif., with 6,274 employees as of the end of June. It operates a vehicle assembly plant in Normal, Illinois.

Amazon and Ford each own more than 5% of the company. Peter Krawiec, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide corporate and business development, sits on Rivian’s board.

Rivian’s commercial vehicle business will be highly dependent on Amazon for the foreseeable future. The company said Amazon has some exclusive rights to purchase electric delivery vehicles from Rivian for at least four years, and the right of first refusal after that.

Like Tesla, Rivian remains a non-unionized automaker for now. The company’s filing acknowledged that this status could change and impact labor costs.

19,investing,FlamingOrange,Is it true that you should always spend money to build wealth? is there any reason to save money you don't need?,"I mean, it may sound odd at first but here's my thinking. Saving, especially especially interest rates as low as they are, won't do much at all ever. you could quite literally make more money in a shorter amount of time by going coin scavenging in parking lots. 

But while the most obvious example of this would be, say, spending 50 dollars to buy a share of a stock, and the stock price increases. you now spent money to make money. But isn't that the only option with *everything* and *anything* at this point? there is no point in saving money, so your only other option is to spend that money to invest it, whether it is in yourself, the stock market, or something physical that has value, such as a house or business you own yourself. 

It just seems like there is no point in saving money. With inflation, among virtually no positives to just saving money when it does nothing, it seems like the best way to preserve or build wealth is to just spend it, right? People might look at your bank account and think you're broke without realizing that you have actual assets working for you, either with real estate, stocks, etc. 

This is just my thinking. I invest every single penny i do not need to live. The other plus side about buying physical things or stocks is they have value past just being an investment. you can for example, live in a house or your business, or your stocks are working for you in terms of price appreciation, dividends, or you can get more money by spending money to further your skills, trade, or education, etc. 


it just seems like there's no reason not to spend money. a lot of people i know seem to be saving money under their mattress and have it just be doing nothing. it just makes no sense to have money doing nothing if you don't use it or have it work for you.",1633123796,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pzhlj6/is_it_true_that_you_should_always_spend_money_to/

21,investing,Speedmaster88,How does a Bond's maturity affects the earning statement of a company? (Security Analysis book),"I'm currently reading Security Analysis (Second edition), it mention how interests, amortization and depreciation will greatly affect the company's earning, and how by undervaluing it's assets the company can ""increase"" it's earning (because of less depreciation). However I didn't see any mention on how a bond's maturity will affect the earning. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say a company issues a 10-Y 5% $1000 bond, so each year it has to pay $50 in interests, it's gross earning is $200.   


So $200 - 50 (interests) -30 (depreciation) -10 (amortization) -20 (taxes) = $90 net earning per year, meaning that if earning doesn't increases the company won't be able to pay back it's $1000 debt upon maturity, even though the interested payments are fully covered. Shouldn't the company be setting money aside for the bond's maturity, and shouldn't that be deducted from it's earning like depreciation and amortization?  


also, what's keeping the stockowners from giving themselves a $90 dividend and giving the middle finger to the bondholders? (the company would still be paying the interests, and would not default until the 10-Y maturity, so the stockowners could milk it for 10 years)",1633121048,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pzgpwm/how_does_a_bonds_maturity_affects_the_earning/

29,investing,CryptoFilip,Why I’m Expecting a Big Week for GME," 

Simplex Trading LLC is the last remaining financial entity listed in the Bloomberg Terminal’s list of PUTs for GME maintaining a file date for their positions of **3/31/2021**. They also hold the largest number of PUTs (80,702 contracts), twice as many as second in line Susquehanna, and are the highest percentage out (10.550%) among those listed. All other PUTs have since been re-filed on **6/30/2021**.

I believe these dates indicate historical Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) activity associated with GameStop and provide an indication of what to expect as we move towards **9/30/2021** and onward.

Background

In January, February 2021 $126.6 billion of loans were said to have been repriced ([S+P Global - March 12th, 2021](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/quick-take-us-clo-refinancing-and-reset-activity-surges-63108875)).

Archegos was liquidated between March 12th and March 26th, 2021 ([Credit Suisse - July 29th, 2021](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/investor-relations/financial-disclosures/results/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf)). It’s been said that the firm turned **$10 billion into an estimated $100 billion** worth of assets ([Bloomberg - April 3rd, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-03/the-number-of-the-week-is-100-billion)).

&gt;“Typically, for new-issue transactions, the CLO debt tranches are collectively 10 times the size of the notional amount of the equity interest.” - [https://www.stout.com/en/insights/article/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting](https://www.stout.com/en/insights/article/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting)

On March 26th, 2021 the Fed reported a daily Reverse Repurchase amount of $11.4 billion. By March 31st, the daily Reverse Repurchase amount skyrocketed up to $134 billion. An increase of $124.297 billion. ([St. Louis Federal Reserve - RRP Chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/)). This was notable because the Fed’s RRP activity had been effectively dormant until this uptick.

Hypothesis

As evidenced by the volume of CLO repricing in Jan/Feb, the end date of the Archegos liquidation, proportion of equity compared to total Archegos assets and uptick in RRPs on March 31st, 2021 my reading leads me to believe that Archegos was more of a CLO Manager than Family Office and that some of their positions (illiquid investments in junk-grade CLOs) were auctioned off and then repriced to SOFR at the end of March 2021.

Historically CLOs were priced off 3-month LIBOR but, out of concern the benchmark was being manipulated by financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is in the process of transitioning CLOs to their own rate called SOFR that is based on the daily RRP amounts ([Bloomberg - July 8th, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/growing-clo-market-has-a-libor-transition-problem-on-horizon)).

9/30/2021 is 3 days away and represents the 2nd-ever quarterly refinancing of CLOs after the formal recommendation of SOFR was made by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ([AARC](https://www.newyorkfed.org/arrc)) on July 29th, 2021.

There is a process called “Warehousing” in the CLO world where “CLO Managers purchase initial collateral before the closing date” which typically lasts 3-6 months ([Pinebridge - September 19th, 2019](https://www.pinebridge.com/en/insights/clo-beyond-the-complexity)).

**9/30/2021 represents the 6-month mark since Simplex filed their 80,702 PUT contracts**.

GME close on 3/31/2021: $189.82

GME close on 6/30/2021: $214.14

GME close on 9/30/2021: ???

Conclusion

While many of my posts have historically shied away from dates I believe the evidence here is too clear and strong to avoid mention. Worth noting 9/30/2021 is just *a* date and, given the fact the average tenor of Archegos’ contracts was 24 months, there could be many other interesting ones as well.",1633117019,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pzffix/why_im_expecting_a_big_week_for_gme/

**CEO Buys Stock and Warrants on Open Market:**

* $CANO is a rapidly growing value-based primary care provider that I've written about in the past.
* The CEO, Marlow ""Max Bid"" Hernandez, aggressively purchased stock and warrants over the month of August  

   * He purchased $26.9M of stock and $1.5M of warrants, mostly on the open market
* On September 27th, he filed a 13D disclosing his holdings. We learned in this filing that ole Marlow MARGINED his existing 22M share position to fund the August purchases of 1.65M shares and 428k warrants
* Clearly Marlow has a ton of confidence in the coming Q3 results and the business overall given the timing of his purchases

34,investing,Puzzleheaded_Bus_418,OPENDOOR ($OPEN) Q3 Results,"Disclosure: I’m long ~550 shares of OPEN and plan on buying short dated calls the week before earnings that expire the following week. 

I wanted to provide an update on my post from earlier in Q3 where I tried estimating Opendoor’s Q3 revenue. 

Now that Q3 is over we have a full picture of the transactions that occurred and can (hopefully) predict the outcome of Q3 revenue. OPEN provided guidance of $1.9 - $2B for Q3. 

I used ibuyerstats.com to analyze all transactions. In Q3, I calculated an estimated 9,218 homes were removed from the website. At an average value of $345,000 per home, that would total $3.18B in revenue. However, using Q2 data from the website and press release I was able to determine that 12% of the homes removed from listing were removed for purposes other than a sale. Therefore, if you remove the 12% (assuming this stays close to consistent in Q3) I estimate revenues will land around $2.7B. Not often do you see 40% beats on revenue estimates, but this is very possible. 

Here’s to a $3.5B+ Q4 and a $15B+ FY2021.

One other thing to note: OPEN was predicting profitability in 2025 not long ago. They are likely to be come profitable in Q3 or Q4 THIS YEAR. Get in while you can.",1633116096,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pzf4gt/opendoor_open_q3_results/

54,investing,CoalFlavored,Sharing Research on Cybin (CYBN) - A New Psychedelic Pharma Company,"Let me start out by saying that I am **NOT** a professional analyst, and that this is **NOT** investment advice. I am simply sharing the research I’ve done on this company. I own around 325 shares.

**1.** **What is Cybin?**

Cybin is a budding Toronto-based biotech company whose goal is to produce psychedelic-based therapeutic medicines for addressing various mental health issues. The psychedelic in question is Psilocybin, the active compound found in so-called “magic mushrooms”. They aim to do this through proprietary drug discovery, new drug delivery systems, and new formulation and approaches for different psychiatric disorders. For the most part, these psychiatric disorders include Major Depressive Disorder and several types of substance abuse including alcohol and nicotine. Millions around the world are afflicted by these issues, and of course that comes with a multi-billion dollar healthcare opportunity.

**2.** **Why Psilocybin?** 

Over the past few years, research has been conducted concerning psilocybin’s effect on mental health, with some promising results. Here are the recent studies that Cybin specifically cites -

[**Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 2017 – Alexander Belser et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/603d2d72126ce0c8a33f0f14_Patient%20experiences.pdf)

This study bills itself as the “first qualitative study of participant experiences in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy”. It was a relatively small study with only 13 participants aged 22 to 69 with an average age of 50 years. All were affected by elevated anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis. They were provided doses of psilocybin and therapy – and the transcripts from those therapy sessions were analyzed to find common themes.

Among all or most of the subjects reported easing of their symptoms and a desire to repeat the experience of taking psilocybin. Some participants showed strong positive reactions to the treatment, such as improved relationships and catharsis of powerful emotion.

The overall conclusion of the study is that psilocybin-assisted therapy may provide an effective treatment for psychological distress in cancer patients.

Some background on the main author –

Alexander Belser holds a PhD in Counseling Psychology from New York University and was a clinical research fellow at Yale 2018-2019. He has spent a couple of decades researching the possibility of psychedelic based clinical treatment with several peer-reviewed journal articles. 2015-2017 He also served on the Board of Advisors for Compass Pathways – a well-known mental health care company. **He is the Chief Clinical Officer of Cybin as of November 2020.**

[**Elsevier Journal of Psychiatry Research, 2020 – Simon Goldberg, et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/603935b9a45a717eeb9287d5_Meta-analysis%20-%20experimental%20effects%20of%20psilocybin%20on%20symptoms%20of%20anxiety%20and%20depression.pdf)

In this meta-analysis, 117 participants were studied across 4 groups; 3 with randomized-placebo controlled tests and 1 uncontrolled. All participants were clinically evaluated to be experiencing elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression. Biases attempted to be mitigated through study design included selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias.

Analysis showed an “evident” effect with statistically significant reductions in anxiety and/or depression systems based on clinical evaluation. Adverse reactions were minor and subsided within a few hours; no long term or serious adverse reactions were recorded.

The meta-analysis provided a few concessions – first that there were only four studies totaling 117 participants. There was a high risk of bias, including the fact that all participants must have been willing to take a Schedule I substance, and that three of the four studies involved cancer patients who may not otherwise be experiencing anxiety and/or depression. There was also limited diversity among subjects (58.25% Female, 86.33% White).

[**JAMA Psychiatry, 2020 – Alan Davis, et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/6039314ec645352a335785ab_Jama_Psychiatry_Davis_2020_Psilocybin_MDD.pdf)

This study sought out to study the effect of psilocybin therapy on patients with Major Depressive Disorder. It studied a pool of 27 participants aged 21 to 75 who all were afflicted by MDD and not currently using antidepressant medications. There was also a focus on cancer patients and other treatment-resistant cases of MDD. The participants were split into two groups of immediate treatment and 8-week delayed treatment.

Ultimately, the study found statistically significant improvements in the clinically evaluated MDD among the participants including half of them in remission by week 4 of the study. The study compared the efficacy of Psilocybin to Ketamine (an already prescribed drug) but with an effect lasting about twice as long (4 weeks versus 2 weeks for Ketamine). Psilocybin, like most psychedelics, also has a low likelihood of addiction (unlike Ketamine).

The study posits that this method of therapy could also be useful for treating a variety of psychiatric conditions including substance abuse disorders.

Although the science is still relatively young, Psilocybin shows positive results in a variety of studies, and has done so for a number of years. What is left is to harness the power of this drug the way we need it to be used.

**3.** **The Cybin Approach (Development Pipeline)**

Not a lot of analysis in this section, but to continue setting the stage here is Cybin’s “three-pillar” approach to drug development –

*1. Novel Drug Discovery Platform - API Modification*

Develop new APIs via selective modifications of tryptamine and phenethlyamine-based scaffolds specifically to alter their pharmacokinetics without modifying their therapeutic potential. (Changing the way drugs move through the body without reducing their effects)

Modifications involve replacing selective hydrogens with deuterium atoms.

Optimizing unique physicochemical attributes e.g. salts, crystal forms, co-crystals, etc.

Pillar One is all about discovering and creating compounds for more efficient drug design.

*2. Proprietary Drug Delivery Systems – Research and Develop*

Efficient delivery system that attempts to bypass the liver metabolism with a direct path to the brain providing faster onset (sublingual distribution).

Modified-release formulations with the potential to reduce side effects and to control exposure.

Dose control through proprietary device platform.

Delivery systems may be applied to many psychedelic compounds.

Pillar Two is all about controlling the way the isolated compound is administered, allowing for varying dosages and reliable medication times – this way patients can get the therapeutic effects of Psilocybin without feeling “high” and being potentially incapacitated for several hours.

*3. Innovative Treatment Regimen – Science Meets Technology*

Software-based platform to gather clinical research data from psychedelic treatment.

Machine learning-based data analytics for improved patient outcomes. 

Patient therapy and integration support.

Pillar Three is all about leveraging technology and data analysis to create effective drugs and treatment plans. This is where they will utilize their partnership with tech startup Kernel, who has created “Flow” – a non-invasive brain monitoring interface. Kernel Flow is like a motion-capture helmet for the head, but utilizes over 1000 sensors to monitor, image, and record precise brain activity with a rate of 200 samples per second. This data will be used to create patient-specific treatment plans.

**4.** **Achievements and In-Progress**

In this section we won’t bother to address superfluous awards or honorary mentions, but instead will focus on actual business activities.

So far they have 15 patent filings, including international patents, which cover a variety of things including novel psychedelic compounds, integration of delivery platforms, methods of use in psychiatric indications, and the drug discovery pipeline of modified and novel ergolines, tryptamines, and phenethylamines. There over 50 molecules covered by these patents.

On the drug development side, there are currently 4 active drug programs –

CYB003-005 cover three drugs who are being designed to respectively treat alcohol abuse, anxiety disorders, and the last to be used for general psychiatry and neurology. These three are still in their pre-clinical phases.

CYB001 is the flagship drug, isolated and modified psilocybin in a sublingual (under-the-tongue) film delivery used to treat Major Depressive Disorder. CYB001 is intended to begin Phase IIA trials by the end of this year, to be followed up with Phase IIB. In the clinical trial system, Phase I provides small doses to subjects and they are observed for extreme side effects or other danger. While completion of Phase I does not necessarily mean the drug is effective, it shows that in a controlled setting the drug is safe to use – and several participants still report positive effects. In Phase II, a larger group of people are split into various treatment groups with varying levels of drug dosage. Placebos are not used in Phase IIa. Phase II will verify that the drug works to some extent, will provide effective data on proper dose ranging (i.e. finding ideal minimum and maximum doses), and will also potentially reveal less-common adverse effects. So long as Phase II still indicates the drug is safe and possibly effective, the drug will move to Phase III which involves the intense scrutiny of double-blind studies, placebos, etc. and is the final phase before being released to market.

In CYB001 Phase IIa, 40 patients will evenly split into treatment groups to be given dosages in the range of 1mg, 3mg, 5mg, 7mg, and 25mg. Phase IIb will examine a group of 120 patients, 80 of which will receive a dose based on the data from IIa, and the remainder will receive a placebo. Phase II will take a total of 12 months, so a Phase III would not be expected until at least 2023, with probably 2024 being the year brought-to-market assuming everything goes well.

CYB003 and 004 are “near” human studies, but no estimated date yet. 

**5.** **Other Notes**

This write-up could really be miles long, but I definitely don’t have the discipline for that. I’m not a financials guy, so I couldn’t tell you much about how they’re doing in this startup phase of the company. So far, the company has managed to raise around C$120M.

The team at Cybin is diverse which includes: the former Ontario Health Minister, the former COO of Loblaws, Canada’s largest food and drug retailer, investment banking experience involving the execution of billions of dollars’ worth of mergers and acquisitions, experienced “new age drug” investment with previous work in cannabis startups, decades of experience in the healthcare industry, and much more.

Obviously, the biggest risk to investing in this company is that they cannot create an approved drug, or it just isn’t that effective. This however does create a large upside, and at around $2.10/share, there is potential to even have a 2x bagger just on news that they’re moving to Phase III trials. An actual drug may be able to bring 4-5x returns by around 2024-25.",1633100252,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pz9qjy/sharing_research_on_cybin_cybn_a_new_psychedelic/

Cathie Wood: Next Big Risk Is Deflation
The underlying assumption out there is that we’re in an inflationary period turbocharged by supply-chain disruptions. I’ve seen a lot of markets and started in the business during the ’70s. I was in college when inflation was raging. So I know what that is. And I truly believe we’re not going back there and that anyone planning for it is probably going to be making some mistakes.

Instead, we see three major deflationary forces brewing.

On the innovation side, we’re in a period today like we’ve never been in. You have to go back to the telephone, electricity and automobile to see three major technologically enabled sources of innovation evolving at the same time. Today, we have five platforms: DNA sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology — all of which are deflationary.

In artificial intelligence, training costs are dropping by 68% per year. What does that mean? We’re going to see a boom in a lot of products that use AI and therefore are better, cheaper, faster and more creative. 

There’s also DNA sequencing costs. To sequence the first whole human genome, it took $2.7 billion and 13 years of computing power. That was 2003. Eighteen years later, we’re down to $500 and a few hours of computing power. For every cumulative doubling in the number of whole human genomes sequenced, costs drop 40%. 

This is going to transform health care, helping us discern which health-care dollars we’re wasting. And we think more than half of all health-care dollars are wasted today.

Then we have electric vehicles and battery pack system technology. For every cumulative doubling in electric vehicles sold, those costs dropped by 28% for the battery, which means the EV costs are going to be dropping roughly 15% every time we see a doubling in sales and we’re in electric vehicle sales infancy right now. Another is industrial robots. Those costs are also dropping more than 20% for every cumulative doubling.

The good news is that this is good deflation, which causes a boom in economic activity, at least where the innovation is taking place.

The corollary to this is bad deflation. Since the tech and telecom bust and the ’08-’09 financial meltdown, there’s been a significant increase in risk aversion in the market. And so many investors and analysts invest very closely to their benchmarks. They don’t want to stray much.

The problem is this innovation is going to be very disruptive to the traditional world order. So the benchmarks today are constructed based on companies’ past successes. But if disruptive innovation is evolving to such a rapid extent, there’s going to be disintermediation and disruption. Companies that have learned to satisfy short-term shareholders — who want their profits and want them now — have been leveraging up to buy back shares and pay dividends.

Companies haven’t been investing enough in innovation, and we’re going to see a lot of carnage out there increasingly during the next five to 10 years. At the beginning of the S&amp;P 500 indexes initiation, the average lifespan of a company was 100 years. We believe it’s down to a little over 20 years now — but it’s going to collapse going forward.

We’re also seeing some interesting signals in cyclicals. 

Lumber prices shot up last year because of all the remodeling and demand for new homes in suburbs. Prices went to $1,700 and that’s down to $600 now. And a lot of people find that hard to believe because housing still seems so hot. I think it’s a leading indicator that prices probably went a little too far, too fast. 

Consumers feel their purchasing power is going down. Prices of goods and services are moving faster than incomes are increasing. So there’s another reason we’re probably going to see a slowdown. 

But even more important is what has happened with supply chains. If you looked at how businesses were positioned before the coronavirus, they’d been pulling back on inventory building and capital spending for about a year to 18 months. And the reason was the U.S.-China trade war, saber rattling, fear of the conflict blowing up in some way. When the coronavirus hit, businesses that had already been cautious slammed on the brakes. And what did the consumer do? The consumer started — after a month or so with the PPP payments — to stimulate the economy. They started spending because their savings rate in the previous few months had skyrocketed.

Businesses were caught flat-footed, and they’re still caught flat-footed. They haven’t been able to catch up. Inventory liquidation in the second quarter was near record-breaking levels. And so what I believe is happening now is businesses, in order to catch up, have been double- and triple-ordering. That’s what happened with lumber prices and why the decline has been so steep since mid-May. And once they see prices coming down, they’ll pull back on those orders. So I think there could be a big drop in commodity and other prices as the consumer has shifted from consuming goods, which are only a third of consumption to consuming services, just as businesses are scrambling aggressively.

A World of Inequality

Mohamed El-Erian: Inequality Creates Next Big Risk
What worries me the most is inequality, both within and across countries. And it’s something that financial markets puts aside as a social problem, not really an economic or financial problem. And we’ve risked seeing the issue of inequality gather momentum. Covid has already been the great un-equalizer, but rather than go back to where we’ve come from, we are now creating the dynamics for inequality to worsen and to assume greater importance in disrupting all sorts of things in our society.

A highly unequal society is not an economic healthy society. But the thing that worries me even more than that is inequality of opportunity. We know what Covid did to people who had no WiFi at home, who had no computers. We know that public school districts lost touch with a lot of their students and these students were not only becoming unemployed, but unemployable, which means a lost generation of young people.

As we slowly emerge from Covid, its aftermath creates different dynamics around the world. If you’re in a developing country today, you can no longer assume that companies will come to you. The onus is increasingly on you coming to the employer. And that is the real issue when education is lagging, when technology is lagging. So I do worry that we’re going to see this massive process get larger, if we’re not careful.

We were watching a tragic movie in play mode and then Covid came along and pressed fast-forward. First, it worsened wealth inequality because the response to Covid involved massive Federal Reserve liquidity injections to boost asset prices. And who owns assets? It’s the rich. So if you look at what has happened, the top part of the wealth distribution, people are much better off than they were before Covid. But at the bottom end, that hasn’t happened.

Think of people whose jobs have been displaced by this big step toward digitalization, who have no financial assets to begin with and don’t benefit from what has happened to asset prices. In addition, they are hoping to buy a house and they’ve been priced out of the housing market. So suddenly both the actual and potential wealth and income has declined.

To add to that, if they are unemployed, there’s suddenly a skills mismatch. There are record levels of vacancies that the labor market is not able to match to workers. And then you get what economists called multiple equilibria: one bad outcome, resulting not in mean reversion, but a high likelihood of an even worse outcome.

We already know what it looks like because we’ve had a taste of it. On the economic side, it looks like insufficient aggregate demand, which is a fancy way of saying that as the rich capture more income and more wealth, they spend less of it. The poor tend to consume more. So if the incremental income and wealth all go to the rich, then you’re going to have the problem of demand, which means you’re going to have a problem of growth.

And we’ve already had a period of so-called secular stagnation, and what my colleagues and I call the new normal, where we get low and insufficiently inclusive growth. We know what that looks like. We know the social consequences. It is cultural war. It’s alienation. It’s marginalization. That’s not good for society. It eats away at the fabric of society.

We know what it looks like politically. People will become single-issue voters, and single-issue voters can be captured by all sorts of things. No wonder we’re seeing an increase in populism across the world. And then it means a less equal world. You know, I grew up interested in developing countries, and for decades it was almost an accepted fact — not a hypothesis, almost an accepted fact — that these countries would converge to the advanced economies.

Well guess what? We’re having divergence going on right now. And I suspect this divergence is not short term. So we may live in a less equal world, or to be more blunt, a much more unequal world. And that’s problematic for global economic policy coordination, interdependency, immigration. I mean, I can go on and on. So it is problematic. We’ve had a taste of it and we don’t quite like that taste, but it could become a lot worse.

The American dream is all about capturing these amazing opportunities and being able to go right up the income ladder. There’s a correct notion that inequality can incentivize people to work harder, to do better, but there comes a point when it goes from encouraging people to do good things to actually detracting from not just economic well-being, but social and political well-being.

I don’t think the American dream is dead. I think it’s harder to achieve. If you don’t have the right education to begin with, if you don’t have a set of assets to begin with, you’re looking at a much steeper curve, and that is a real problem for too many people.

The prescription is investing in human and physical infrastructure. It’s about enabling people to do more and to do better. It’s about providing people with transformational opportunities. It starts at a very early age, at pre-K, exposing bright minds to exciting education and opportunities. It continues throughout the middle school, high school, university, making elite universities more accessible to people who deserve to be there but may be held back because they come from the wrong zip code or because their parents have never had an education.

There’s a lot that can be done. It’s about fundamentally asking the question, ‘How do we enable our resources, human and physical, to be more inclusive and more productive?’

Hackers on the Loose

Scott Minerd: Unprotected Financial Network Is Next Big Risk
The No. 1 one risk is the sustainability of the global payment system. And I choose the word sustainability over the word vulnerability, because the real key here is keeping the global payment system running, and we’ve had so many hacks, terrorist attacks, the Colonial Pipeline incident. It would appear that we are extremely vulnerable to having an attack against the payment system of the financial markets — and not just here in the U.S., but in Europe.

What I’m talking about is things like the Fedwire, where the banks’ money clears through. But also something like the DTCC, SWIFT, Euroclear. I mean, I can just keep going on and on and on. And if there was a synchronized attack, we would essentially bring the global financial market to its knees. The first response would probably be that securities prices would crash, and the second is we would probably have to close all the exchanges in the world in order to figure out how to restore the global payments system.

The thing that bothers me about the global payment system is, I don’t think anyone’s focused on it. And this really takes a high degree of international cooperation. It takes a real macro look, meaning there needs to be somebody or some group of people looking at how everything interconnects and where the potential vulnerabilities are.

I would put the probability [of it happening] as very high. Certainly well over 50%. I got accused once when talking about this that I’m actually alerting terrorists and other governments on how to attack us. But the likelihood is they’re already thinking about it.

With the Fed, when I speak to them, they don’t really comment on it. And there’s two interpretations to that: They just don’t think it’s that serious, or they believe it’s so serious that they don’t really want to say anything. Just as we found out with the electric grid, one vulnerability is that the system isn’t hardened enough and we need to harden it for security reasons. The payment system is the same sort of thing. Even though the Fedwire has been modernized over time, it’s still built off an infrastructure that’s extremely old.

We need international cooperation to assess the risk and figure out how we can harden the system that exists in the short run and, in the long run, modernize it. Delivery versus payment, which is the standard way that we’ve delivered securities for 100 years, is in an age like ours, kind of ridiculous. There’s no reason why that just can’t be instantaneous.

But that’s going to take a new generation of technology and whether that’s blockchain or whatever, it needs to be modernized. But in the short run, central banks, exchanges and so forth need to take a hard look at their systems, not just their system, but at the interconnectivity of the system and how secure is that connection that’s being made. Not just from the standpoint of it having being disrupted, but since you’re sending information through the ether, what’s the chance that that can be redirected somewhere.

Certainly, the internet’s vulnerable, right? One of the comments I made to people about cyber cryptocurrency in general is: Why do I need to transact through the internet? Why can’t I just text it to you?

There are other ways to transfer things through the ether, right? So for instance, if you look at crypto as an example, the weak link is the fact that it’s linked to the internet. Even if the blockchain was forever and perfect and hardened and you couldn’t steal from it — which is not true — if you pull the internet down, you’re done.

The U.S. government will play a huge part in [creating a new system] just because we are the financial center of the world. However, to quote Winston Churchill, the U.S. government will always do the right thing after it’s exhausted every other option. So, I don’t think they’re going to go there right away. I think that there’ll be a lot of patches.

21,investing,trueconviction,The best investments are hiding in plain site,"I will be offering what I hope are a few constructive suggestions for folks looking to grow their money at outsized returns with minimal risk.


There is a catch, of course. These methods involve both labor and are capped by scale. The good news is scale is very high relative to most people's net worth, and labor or time
is a commodity that can be managed and sometimes outsourced.


The most classic example is the intrinsic purchasing power of cash. When you buy in bulk typically your unit price generates savings. The more cash one has on hand, the more they
have the ability to buy a good or service at a historically low price. Every one knows this already, and this isnt very practical because such savings are really only appropriate
when buying necessities. If you are a business that has high cost of goods chances are a great deal of your focus already revolves around savings on consumables.

Every one is also already familiar with the concepts of investing in real estate, education, health, purchasing and learning to operate new tools and hardware, etc. All these things
are great and typically necessitate the cultivation of skill and demand some amout of time, and can be difficult or inconsistent to predict future earnings with. Most importantly,
countless experts who know far more than me about these subjects have already written to great length about these subjects.

What I am offering to suggest here is my primary source of income, namely manufactured spending and account churning.

For account churning, the basic concept is to meet certain thresholds to acquire cash bonuses on new accounts (typically such accounts consist of checking/savings accounts, brokerage
accounts, and sportsbook/gambling accounts). For bank accounts, there is not much strategy to this other than timing your eligibility windows with various instiutions. You will need
to tie up your cash in an account for a certain minimum period of time. If you annualize the lockup period and compare it to the bonus, you will typically realize a rate of return that
is extremely high for the lack of risk. This can be scaled fairly high (many brokerages have bonus tiers extending to the 100k range for new accounts, many banks have bonuses for
deposits up to 20k, and there are hundreds of banks offering bonuses at any given time, and you can repeat this process for each SSN). If you are capable of managing a spreadsheet with a lot of accounts, this is something
you can easily sink low millions into basic account churning. Typically bonuses can be repeated every 2 years, although this will vary greatly among institutions). Be sure to 
prepare to receive a lot of 1099-INTs and 1099-MISC's for your tax year. Some people that are very experienced in account churning will further scale by offering complete account
management to friends to make use of their SSN with their permission and receive a management fee.


Here a couple of tricks and tips: 1. Make use of pre-existing tools and datapoints for tracking eligiblity criteria and opportunities. Some good places to start include
reddit.com/r/churning and doctorofcredit.com 2. For accounts requiring spending activity, buy low volatity products such as T-bills whenever possible. When on gambling sites,
make sure you have a second SSN to simultaneously bet on opposite positions for each account separately. 3. Get very familiar with the regulatory bodies for each account you use
(for example, CFPB, OCC, etc) in case you need to make a complaint or expedite the process of your bonus being awarded.


Credit card bonuses are great and require minimum capital but typically do not scale as high as bank account bonuses. reddit.com/r/churning is a good basic resource for this.
I highly recommend going after them if you understand how to manage your credit score and learn the basics of managing applications to reduce impact to your credit score.


For manufactured spending, the basic concept is to use a rewards generating credit or debit card to purchase a cash-equivalent that can be readily liquidated back to cash at 
a rate whose rewards outweigh any associated transaction costs. For a basic example, consider using an american express blue cash preferred to buy a $500 visa gift card at your local grocer.
(a cash equivalent item). The cash back rate is 6% at a grocery store and the activation fee is 1%, so you are making 5%. You liquidate the visa gift card to another cash equivalent
(such as by making a billpayment, purchasing a money order, reloading a prepaid account, making a debit card deposit to an account, etc). You then transfer this money to your bank account
to pay off your card if you didnt already just make a direct payment on your credit card. You then cycle this as much as you can. 


The annualized ROI for cycling is typically very high. For example, consider cycling an unlimited 2% cash back card such as citi double cash or spark business cash. Let's suppose
your credit limit is 10k. On day 1 of a new cycle you buy 10k of visa gift cards and liquidate in the same day. By day 3 or 4 the charge for your gift card purchases posts to your
account and you now initiate payment. On a seasoned account, payment should typically post within a couple more business days. Suppose payment posts at day 7. This is a complete cycle.
You repeat the cycle 52 times in a year. Your annualized return on your cash is easy to calculate. 10k*0.02*52=10.4k. Suppose you incurred 1% in fees. Your annualized return is 50%
for very little risk. More importantly, this can be scaled and compounded. The cash back earned can be reinvested to cycle which is the compounding part. The scale part comes from
the fact that you can easily obtain large credit limits with strong payment history and that you can prepay certain credit cards such as amex and bofa. So if you have $100M sitting,
amex will happily let you wire $100M from your bank account to them and now your card temporarily has $100M available to spend. This is just one example. There are many ways to 
manufactured spend without gift cards (the liquidation outlets mentioned above such as such as by making a billpayment, purchasing a money order, reloading a prepaid cardaccount,
 making a debit card deposit to an account are often also simultaneously manufactured spending outlets as well).


Another means to scale high at low margins is wholesale reselling. However it is far riskier to resell than it is to buy cash equivalents since you have to trust the creditworthiness of your
buyers and the risk of your items being lost in transit. It is very similar to manufactured spending in the sense that 100% of your revenue can come from cash back without
there being any sort of comission on goods sold. This is precisely also the reason why it scales so well, since costs are externalized from the buyer to the banks to the interchange
fees the banks charge the merchants. The tradeoff is your scale is extraordinarily high (you can easily sink hundreds of millions of dollars into wholesale reselling)
and profit margins are often higher.



I hope this post inspires fellow investors to consider alternatives beyond equities. With a little skill and creativity, you can recreate ROI generating machines whose risk
and consistently you can directly control. If you have ideas and things that work well for you kindly consider sharing your knowledge for others here as well :)",1633026095,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pypnrh/the_best_investments_are_hiding_in_plain_site/

40,investing,utradea,My Thoughts On Why Retail Investors Have An Advantage Over Institutional Investors,"Hey Everyone,

I wanted to share an analysis of why individual investors have an advantage over institutional investors and can beat the market. Would love to hear your feedback and thoughts.

# Introduction

Imagine you’re a new investor who just downloaded a brokerage app. Now image you’re in charge of an actively managed fund with a team of PhDs working for you. Both of these parties are planning on actively managing their portfolios by selecting individual stocks or bonds. Which one is going to generate higher returns? The answer probably seems pretty clear. If there’s any amount of inefficiency in the market worth taking advantage of it’s going to be captured by those with the most resources and the best education, right?

Wrong, which is what makes the stock market great. There are five key advantages individuals have compared to intuitional investors and passive funds.

1. *Individual investors won’t be fired after a few bad quarters*
2. *Access to information has never been greater, and is free in most cases*
3. *As an individual investor, time is on your side*
4. *Smaller account sizes provide more freedom*
5. *Individual investors can take greater risks*

We will dive into this in more detail, but first let’s look at a bit of history.

Advocates of passive index investing are quick to point out that passive funds have beaten active funds 86% of the time over the past 20 years \[1\]. Between 1991 and 1996 it was a tossup with active funds winning three years and losing three others \[2\]. That time frame was chosen so that we can have a fair comparison later on. In more recent memory, passive funds have won every year since 2013 with no signs of letting up. People quickly conclude that if actively managed funds with teams of PhDs can’t outperform a market index consistently that it must be nearly impossible for a retail investor to do so. This comparison sounds pretty logical on the surface but doesn’t look into the differences between the two groups.

**Retail investors can skip the management fees, can’t be fired for underperforming, are able to invest in a wider range of companies, and can take on as much risk as they want.**

Armed with these advantages retail investors outperformed market weighted index funds 49% of the time before fees from 1991 to 1996, almost the exact same rate as the active funds \[3\]. If you include fees that number drops to 43%. However, many modern brokerages no longer have fees to place orders. Both sides have advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other. This race is a lot closer than most people think.

# Individual Investors Aren’t Fired for A few Bad Quarters

If you’re a fund manager who decides to go a little outside of the box and ends up buying a lot of stocks that aren’t part of the S&amp;P 500 you could run into an issue. Let’s say those stocks you picked ended up doing really poorly this year while the S&amp;P did fine. Managing this fund is your job. If you don’t do well you could be removed from your position. Maybe they let one bad year slide, but could you underperform your peers for two years? How about three? At some point you’re going to get fired. The retail investor could underperform for a decade and still come out on top. The market is very cyclical and some popular and reliable strategies just don’t work for years at a time. Take value investing during the last decade as an example. The market has been dominated by highly valued growth stocks. Even if you carefully selected strong value stocks you would probably not be above the S&amp;P 500 during this period. Despite this, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by an average of 4.54% per year since 1928 \[4\].

# Information has Been Democratized – Institutions are Still Paying

When you have a team of PhDs working for you to help select your stocks you have to pay them. You also need to pay yourself, pay for the office, and for any other resources you use during the selection process. These costs are going to be passed onto the investors of the fund in the form of management fees.

***These fees often cost between 0.5% and 1% annually \[5\].***

This piece is taken each year whether the fund does well or not. This means that even if the retail investor and the fund held the exact same stocks the retail investor would come out ahead.

# Time is on Your Side

Any active fund is going to be extra aware of their quarterly and annual goals. They’re going to be frequently rebalancing to meet certain requirements whether it be a risk level, an amount of diversification, or a reevaluation of their pick’s financials \[6\].

A retail investor can hold a single stock for 40 years if they believe in the long term future of the business. Let’s say both the retail investor and the fund bought Apple at the same time 20 years ago. Apple has grown an insane amount during this time frame. As one stock outpaces the rest it starts to take up a larger and larger portion of your portfolio.

The fund would likely end up selling some of their shares to bring the size of their Apple holding back in line with the rest. This also lowers their exposure to the tech sector which they would also want to keep at a certain level. The retail investor on the other hand has no such limit. He can buy it and hold it until he retires.

# Size Matters But Individual Investors Can Use it Wisely

The average retail investor is buying thousands of dollars of stock at most. The average fund is buying hundreds of thousands of dollars and often millions. This is important for a few reasons. Thousands of dollars will not have any effect on the price of most stocks whereas a million dollars can move a sizeable company. The more money being invested the more it can push the price. When you are buying tons of shares the price is going to creep upwards as you look for more and more sellers. This means that the more you buy the worse your average entry price will be. The same thing happens when you sell. Unloading millions of dollars in shares is going to drop the price which means you get a poor exit price as well. The retail trader does not have to deal with this and will have better prices on both ends which leads to better performance, even if the same stocks are picked!

The size of the investment doesn’t only affect the prices you get, it also influences what you can even attempt to buy in the first place. Some publicly traded companies have market caps of 50 million or less. It’s just not feasible for huge funds to be buying into these companies. If a fund ever buys so much of a company that it owns 5% it will need to register that with the SEC and is forced to file beneficial own reports \[7\]. The retail trader will never run into this issue.

# Individual Investors Can Use Risk to Their Advantage

We’ve seen a few reasons why funds tend to stick the S&amp;P 500 companies. We’ve also seen that they are surprisingly risk averse. Whether it be buying smaller companies, having a more concentrated portfolio, or making use of derivatives like long term call options, the retail investor has the ability to take on as much risk as they want.

If you’re familiar with the statistics behind optimized betting you’ll know what the Kelly Criterion is. In short, it’s a way to determine the optimal size bet you should take\*\*.\*\*

**The Kelly Criterion says that you should be holding a little more than 200% in the S&amp;P 500 for maximum returns, at least historically \[8\].**

This is a heavily leveraged and high risk account but was able to survive both the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis. Despite higher returns in the long term this portfolio underperforms the market for years after each crash. This makes it unrealistic for a fund manager to try to execute, but if you can handle the risk it’s an option available to every retail investor who has a long time horizon.

# Final Thoughts: If Managed Properly, These Advantages Allow Individual Investors to Beat the Market

It’s true that most actively managed funds do not outperform their passive counterparts. This is often used to cast doubt on the performance of retail investors. If the experts can’t outperform, how could you? Well, it turns out there are a lot of differences between billion dollar funds and some guy on his Robinhood app. A surprising amount of these differences offer the retail investor an advantage, or at the very least an additional degree of freedom. Using actively managed funds as a benchmark is incredibly misleading.

The odds are not in your favor as an average stock picking retail investor, but they’re not nearly as bad as they’re usually portrayed\*\*.\*\*

**In the same 1991-1996 study 25% of retail investors outperformed the index by 6% or more annually.**

If you dedicate the time and have good emotional control you can capitalize on these advantages most people don’t even know they have.

\----

TLDR; The individual investors has a number of advantages over institutional investors and can beat the market

31,investing,NineteenSixtySix,"New U.S. SEC rules to call on hedge funds, endowments to disclose votes","WASHINGTON/BOSTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator on Wednesday will propose requiring large hedge funds and endowments to disclose how they vote on executive pay, bringing this clutch of influential investors in line with other top funds that have made their pay votes public for a decade.

The changes proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will also include mandates for investors to provide more details about how share lending affects proxy voting and to make certain reports machine-readable, an SEC official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Together the changes from the Democratic-led agency are meant to bring more transparency to shareholder annual meetings, partly by implementing rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010.

If approved by a majority of the five-member commission on Wednesday, the rule changes would be subject to a 60-day public comment period before further action.

Among S&amp;P 500 company CEOs average total pay rose 52% to $12.18 million in 2020 from $8 million a decade earlier, according to compensation consultant Farient Advisors.

Among other things Dodd-Frank mandated shareholders get the chance to cast so-called ""say-on-pay"" advisory votes on executive compensation, which have put a focus on CEO pay at many corporate annual meetings for the past decade.

The votes, combined with the disclosures that big mutual fund firms have filed since 2004 via Form N-PX, had already brought scrutiny to the biggest asset managers. read more

But SEC Democratic Commissioner Allison Lee told an industry audience in March that the Form N-PX disclosures are too unwieldy to show retail investors how their money is voted and because they currently are not filed by certain investment firms. read more

Separately, some managers have given up their rights to vote in exchange for fees when they lend out shares to short-sellers. While this can cut costs for investors, it has also changed the outcome of corporate elections, according to proxy solicitors.

Industry groups say that if the SEC's proposals prove too costly, those burdens would be passed on to fund shareholders. They also said the success of the SEC's rule change may depend on how quickly vendors can adapt to machine-readable technology.

Critics of the say-on-pay rule, including its co-author, say it did little to slow the growth of rewards for top U.S. executives.

Top asset managers still overwhelmingly back executive pay, according to new data from researcher Insightia showing that during the 12 months ended June 30 three of the largest fund firms each supported management on pay about 95% of the time, roughly the same as the prior period.

46,investing,nobjos,Should you invest in the most reputable brands in the world? - Benchmarking performance of the worlds most reputable brands against S&amp;P500,"Coke is just soda.

Levi’s are just jeans.

The iPhone is just a phone.

Yet, we go out of our ways to select certain brands over others - most of the time at a higher price \[1\]. Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:

* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases
* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products
* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them

Basically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \[2\], reputations can make or break a company’s performance.

In one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/). So this week, let’s see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!
___
**Data**

While there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https://www.reptrak.com/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.

They base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.

I am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \[2012 - 2021\] 
___
**Analysis**

RepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.

Even though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \[3\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \[4\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years &amp; till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \[5\]
___
 **Results** 

**Return Comparison - SPY vs Top 10 - Most Reputable Brands** 

|Time Period|Most Reputable Brand (Avg Return)|SPY (Avg Return)|Alpha|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 Year|17.1%|16.2%|0.9%|
|3 Years|44.8%|41.2%|3.6%|
|5 Years|94.1%|77.9%|16.2%|
|Till Date|188.3%|136.4%|51.9%|

 

Companies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.

My hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.

[Another interesting insight](https://preview.redd.it/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796) we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year’s list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7/10 years \[6\]. 
___
**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year’s worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.
* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \[7\]
* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return &amp; Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through). 
___
**Conclusion**

Whether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \[8\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.

Our analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market! So now you know what to do next time when your friend is swearing by a brand.

Until next week…

**Footnotes and Existing Research**

\[1\] [This great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eIDBV4Mpek&amp;ab_channel=BigThink) by Big Think showcases how Apple and Nike have spent billions of dollars for creating a positive brand image in our brains and most of us, in the end, are not rational customers.

\[2\] [Reputation and Its Risks](https://hbr.org/2007/02/reputation-and-its-risks) \- Harvard Business Review

\[3\] The main reason for stopping with the Top 10 is the manual data pull process. They do not give a stock ticker associated with the stock nor is the list easily parsable. Given we are pulling data for 10 years, I limited myself to the top 10 companies.

\[4\] A stock is only considered if it’s directly investable from the US market and is an independent company (Examples of companies ignored - Rolex, LEGO Group, and Bosch)

\[5\] Before you come at me with Pitchforks for using S&amp;P 500 instead of Nasdaq Composite, please take a look at the list of companies. It’s from a wide variety of industries. Adding to this, even though tech provided the majority of returns, starting in 2012, you would not have any idea about the tech run we would be having over the next decade.

\[6\] I don’t think 2020 and 2021 should be counted here due to two reasons. First, it’s not enough time as we can see from the first graph (there is very little difference in performance over 1 year period), and secondly, 2020 was one of the largest bull runs in the history of SPY.

14,investing,thecrazednutter,Is gold still a store of value?,"I am starting to think that gold is no longer a suitable inflation hedge. We are experiencing the most inflation in over 30 years right now and gold is not budging. In fact, gold is approaching pre-pandemic prices. Furthermore, real interest rates, which are interest rates that take inflation into account, are among the lowest they've been in 50 years. They were higher in the mid-70s and early-80s. Gold is not rising and maybe it is because it is a) not fashionable and b) no longer suitable for this era.

However, if inflation persists gold could still rebound. In the event of continued or above trend inflation, investor's will feel a need to find a store of value. Large institutional investors have a duty to preserve their clients' investments. They will buy anything that holds value, even if it doesn't rise much. Gold could be a logical pick because it is somewhat easy to buy and has a long track record.

Instead, the dumbasses let the sum sit and sit...in a money market account. It made exactly *nothing*. I didn't find out about that until very recently. Cost me thousands.

I had other complaints about Vanguard (talking to anybody on the advisor team required reserving a time slot literally *weeks* in advance, which is *worse* service than I got *before* I signed up for Personal Advisor). The mistake with the money transfer/reinvestment finally clinched it. I canceled the agreement, and am on my own again.

So now I have a good chunk of money sitting on the sidelines. I'm a big fan of dollar-cost averaging but that's not really an option here — I have eight or nine years till retirement and that dough has to go to work ASAP.

So... What's the safest yet most efficient way to feed this money-market sum back into stocks and bonds?",1632851428,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pxbsum/i_have_a_chunk_of_money_i_dont_know_how_to_feed/

25,investing,elemental333,Wash Sale making my cost basis insane...anything I can do?,"Hi everyone...so a few weeks ago I bought shares of a stock at an ATH and have been averaging my cost basis down in an attempt to still come out ahead. During another run up, I sold all of my shares of this stock (most for profit, but some for a slight loss) and overall made some decent money.

This stock just dipped and I went to buy more...however, I lost track of the exact number of days it had been since I sold some shares at a loss, so I got hit with the wash sale rule. I am now down A LOT on this stock due to my cost basis being almost double the share price. 

This is my first major mistake since I began actively trading earlier in the year and I'm trying to recoup as much of my gains as possible. Is there anything I can do about this or do I just have to take the loss and live and learn?

Thank you!",1632851092,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pxbomu/wash_sale_making_my_cost_basis_insaneanything_i/
29,investing,Connorvo,Can you beat the market by copying CEO Performance Grants? It looks like you might!,"I scraped every new performance grant CEOs received in 2017 to see if copying those trades would beat the market. The initial results are very promising (12-25% ɑlpha on average depending on the timeframe), but more research needs to be done!

# How it works:

I wrote a python script that scraped every single Form 4 filed in 2017. It was only looking for filings that matched the below criteria:

1. The grant was a Performance Grant. Performance Grants are used to reward executives with stock only if they reach certain performance targets
2. The Performance Grant targets were for the stock to reach specified price targets. This means that the executive would receive stock ***only*** if the stock hit certain price targets during the given timeframe
3. The executive receiving the grant was a CEO or President.
4. The grant was not regularly scheduled (i.e. it wasn’t a grant they would receive every year). FIltering these out makes it more likely that the grant was given because the CEO and Board of Directors have confidence that the stock can reach the price targets.

# Overall Results

These kinds of grants don’t happen very often, there were only 9 of them in 2017, but they did indeed beat the market.

Of the 9 stocks that were found, all of them peaked at a price more than 35% above the performance grant and 6 of them peaked up more than 100% in the 3 years following the grant.

The below table is the average returns by months since the performance grant for the SPY and the stocks I found.

Taking a slightly closer look at “Max Returns” in the table below, we can see it took anywhere from 141 days to 1088 days for the stocks to reach their max return since the grant. The average was \~700 days, meaning it takes about 2 years for most of the stocks to hit their peak.

You will also see that 6 of the 9 stocks reached their performance grant targets. 2 of the 3 stocks that didn’t reach their targets had insanely high targets of 160% and 260% stock returns and both of the stocks had well over 100% returns. The other target that wasn’t reached had a 58% target but was the worst-performing stock

This grant only had one vesting date, February 6, 2020, but the grant would vest if it hit the price targets at any point between the grant date and February 6, 2020. The stock had vesting targets at $11, $14, and $18. The stock fell about 14% over the next 2.5 months before then popping up to $10.20 (37% return) about 5 months after the grant date. The stock then had a looooong fall for the next \~1.5 years until February 6, 2020. The stock recovered and reached all the way up to $15 after COVID, but the performance grant had already expired so they never received any of the awards.

The grant could begin vesting immediately and they had 2.5 years to reach the goal. The stock price immediately started going up after the performance grant and reached a local maximum of $10.55 (85% return) 4 months after the initial grant before spending the next year and a half going down to below $7. This grant was an all-or-nothing grant where the price had to reach $16 within 2.5 years to vest. It never reached that goal but maxed out at $12.53 (120% return) about 2 years after the initial grant.

These grants could start paying out immediately upon hitting the $15 target and they had until the end of 2020 to hit that goal. Unlike most grants, they only gave an all-or-nothing $15 price target instead of tiered price targets that start out easier to hit. They never quite got to the $15 price target but did cross $13 (almost a 200% return) right around the 1-year mark.

It then tumbled again before reaching its overall maximum of almost $130 3 years later. Because the performance grant required at least one year to pass before reaching the target stock price would count towards the grant, the execs actually didn't start receiving the grant awards until the end of 2020 when the stock started going on a tear

This grant was only able to start paying out between the 1st and 3rd anniversary of the grant, so even though the execs hit the target price 9 months later, they didn't start getting paid out until close to the 3-year mark when they finally got above the target price again

# FAQs / Concerncs

***What is a Form 4?***

A Form 4 is filed any time an executive at a public company buys, sells, or is granted stock. They are required to file with the SEC within 3 days of taking the action

***Why did you pick 2017?***

Most performance grants have a timeline that is 3 years or shorter (though some are up to 5 years). 2017 ensures enough time has passed for the grant to actually play out

***Where did you get the data?***

The SEC has a database (EDGAR) that lets you scrape all of the info from all of the SEC filings

***Why did you pick the timeframes you chose (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months)?***

No particular rhyme or reason. I felt like these gave a pretty good overview of the short, medium, and long-term returns for each grant.

***9 stocks aren’t very many***

True. The sample size is very small. I am in the process of doing the analysis for more years to increase this number, but the number will never get very large as these types of grants don't happen super often.

**This isn't adjusted for risk in any way**

This is also true. These stocks vary from small to large market cap and have different levels of volatility which can affect the returns on a risk-adjusted basis. It may be worth diving into risk adjustments at some point, but right now I want to focus on gathering more data and seeing if there are any potentially viable investment strategies around the data.

# Takeaways

I definitely think this is promising, but the hard part is putting it into action. Obviously, if we could see the future and sell at the max price for all of the stocks, we’d all make millions, but the stocks don’t all just go up and to the right.

Some of them fall before popping, some pop and then fall, some pop then fall then pop even more.

There is potentially a viable strategy involving holding the stocks until they reach some return threshold (maybe like 25%) and then letting it run with a stop-loss, but I think I need more data to build better strategies. I will work on gathering more data.",1632846860,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pxa7vo/can_you_beat_the_market_by_copying_ceo/

93,investing,ini0n,The Great Market Wheeze is almost upon us,"I don't expect this to be super popular but I want to make it as a record to say I called it. 

The good times are almost up. 

Here's a long wall of text, don't apologise for it, no TLDR. Don't expect anyone to read this anyway.

--- **Everything depends on treasury bonds and inflation** ---

Don't look at the S&amp;P as a PE ratio, but as a yield, so it's 1:1 with bonds. For example the S&amp;P 500 has a 34.75 PE - in earnings yield 2.9% a year. The ratio between treasuries and the S&amp;P 500 is called BEER (bond equity earnings yield ratio). 

Currently a 10 year US treasury yields 1.4% and S&amp;P 2.9%. The yield on a treasury can't exceed stocks in the long run, who would buy stocks if they could do better in risk free bonds. S&amp;P comes with risk premium due to downturns. 

Treasury yield are near all-time lows due to a number of factors including COVID and the fed printing $120b/month to buy securities. Low treasury yields make S&amp;P look more attractive, driving up the price and down the yield. 2.9% is better then 1.4%.

This relationship between treasuries, inflation and stock yields determines *everything.*

Money supply has expanded rapidly due to massive printing. M1 massively, M2 slightly so far. As the velocity of money increases with reopening it guarantees M2 expansion.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL

Wages are up, commodity prices are up which in conjunction with massive money printing *guarantees* inflation will at the very least run hotter then it was pre-2020 for an extended period of time. How hot... who knows? In 2019 it was 1.8%, so at a minimum we're looking at 2%, probably higher. Not hyper-inflation but hotter then before. This is a certainty. 

--- **The debt burden** ---

The government funds itself with treasuries and so the yield it has to pay is a major deal. The US has $29t in debt, at a 1.4% yield that's $400b/year in interest payments. Manageable. At 14%, as it was in the 80s, that's $4t a year, almost as much as the entire yearly $6.5t budget. Unmanageable. 

This massive debt expansion gives very little room for the fed to manoeuvre, which makes it very predictable. The fed *cannot* allow inflation run too hot as it would bankrupt America. 

Given a choice between crashing the market and inflation it will crash the market. It does not have the option to do anything else, it cannot let yields rise significantly. 

--- **So what does this mean for stocks?** ---

Remember: Inflation rate &lt; Treasury yields &lt; S&amp;P yields

PE ratios going up over last 30 years is not the result of investors randomly deciding stocks are worth more. It's the result of low inflation, therefore low treasury yields, therefore low S&amp;P yields, therefore PE going up, therefore stocks going up. 

The US economy in real terms has been barely growing, a couple percent a year at best, the massive bull run over the last decade is not a sign of economic prosperity, it's almost purely multiple expansion. We're at one end of the pendulum and now it has to swing back.  

Inflation guaranteed to go up = treasury yields guaranteed to go up = S&amp;P yield guaranteed to go up (PE ratio going down). 

The yield on a treasury can't trail inflation significantly and historically has sat above inflation. There are less buyers for something guaranteed to lose purchasing power every year. 

That means if inflation sits at 2.5% we're looking at treasury yields at a minimum of 3-4%. Which means S&amp;P yield (currently 2.9%) has to sit up around 5-6%. This would involve the S&amp;P losing *half* its value from relatively small absolute changes to inflation. 

Even the fed estimates inflation to be 4% in 2021 and 2% going forward which will be the absolute best case scenario. 2% inflation would still cause at least a 20% drop in stocks, probably much more.

--- **Conclusion** ---

Inflation running hotter is a mathematic certainty. Treasury yields going up is a mathematic certainty. S&amp;P PE ratio (and therefore stock price) coming down is a mathematic certainty. 

The fed can choose to either fight inflation and crash the market, or let inflation run free and support the market. It will mostly choose the former, however we will see a bit of both. Inflation will run hotter then expected and stocks will fall.

The market won't crash all at once bar some unforeseeable event, this won't happen overnight, it will gradually wheeze down as treasury yields adjust to the asset purchase taper and inflation ticking up. I am naming the upcoming event **""The Great Wheeze""** and I expect everybody to call it this.

The underlying economy will keep ticking along relatively normal as before, so barely growing in real terms, but stocks will spend years in decline as treasury yields rise. People will recommend 60/40 stock/bond portfolios again. If you are looking to work in investment banks ask to join the bond division. 

I predict this will start within 12 months, probably accelerate early-mid next year and continue. 

--- **Is there a way to make money from this?** ---

The problem with everything bubbles is there's less opportunity. Almost everyone is going to take a hit.

Diversify away from US stocks, invest in low PE foreign markets with high underlying growth to counteract PE compression. Economies that aren't to dependant on exporting to the US is best. We're at the cusp of a new era in investment that will be defined by international markets. Commodity and defensive value stocks with decent dividends are probably solid.

The other option is to hedge with 20-40% of your portfolio. Hedge against treasury yields going up (hello Burry) and the market going down. Goofy valuation stocks will fall the most. The problem is the market can stay irrational for extended periods of time.

Holding cash is ok, but inflation will start to eat into its purchasing power. There's not going to be a sudden dip and then rebound, it will wheeze out for years, as it's not caused by some temporary recoverable event like COVID or the GFC, it's caused by the economic equivalent of gravity.  

The other option is markets don't collapse in uniform. Typically there's a cascade of collapse that starts at fringe markets and heads inwards towards the core. If you're holding stocks pre-collapse, selling them and buying in sectors that have already collapsed is another play.

Best of luck fellas, catch you on the other side.",1632793845,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pwvway/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/
97,investing,informedFinancials,Married men with dependents are more likely to panic sell during a crash.,"&gt; Despite standard investment advice to the contrary, individuals often engage in panic selling, liquidating significant portions of their risky assets in response to large losses.Using a novel dataset of 653,455 individual brokerage accounts belonging to 298,556 households, we document the frequency, timing, and duration of panic sales, which wedefine as a decline of 90% of a household account’s equity assets over the course of onemonth, of which 50% or more is due to trades. We find that a disproportionate numberof households make panic sales when there are sharp market downturns, a phenomenonwe call ‘freaking out’. We show that panic selling and freakouts are predictable andfundamentally different from other well-known behavioral patterns such as overtradingor the disposition effect. Investors who are male, or above the age of 45, or married, orhave more dependents, or who self-identify as having excellent investment experience orknowledge tend to freak out with greater frequency. We use a five-layer neural networkmodel to predict freakout events one month in advance, given recent market conditionsand an investor’s demographic attributes and financial history, which exhibited truenegative and positive accuracy rates of 81.5% and 69.5%, respectively, in an out-of-sample test set. We measure the opportunity of cost of panic sales and find that, whilefreaking out does protect investors during a crisis, such investors often wait too longto reinvest, causing them to miss out on significant profits when markets rebound.

There is no doubt O&amp;G is still going to be here for a long time: aircraft still need fuel, transport trucks aren't going fully electric anytime soon, plastics and other oil based products aren't going to be replaced by synthetics in the neat term.   


Obviously EVs are the big one that has the capacity to put a dent in global oil consumption, but they are still a long way off from being truly affordable to the masses and we're missing critical infrastructure to support them. There is no way I'm personally even interested in an EV until refueling is a 5 minute affair and there is enough public charging infrastructure to not have to wait in lines on busy travel weekends.   


So I can convice myself O&amp;G still has PLENTY of runway left, especially in the wake of COVID, but then I see things like Porsche's [synthetic fuel](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35577611/porsche-synthetic-efuel-clean-emissions-testing/), non-petroleum based plastics, and some of the majors leaving some high value oil fields and diversifying into non OG based markets, causing me to think maybe I need to diversify more or at least quicker than I was planning to.

14,investing,scarberia123,'Panic sellers during stock market dips are often married men with children' MIT,"Panic selling is common after stock market dips, and it’s more likely to happen with certain investors, according to research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

When the market drops, men who are over age 45, or are married with children or have self-described “excellent investment experience” are more prone to sell-offs, the research shows. 

“These are significant drivers of panic selling,” said co-author Chi Heem Wong, researcher at MIT. And many who leave the stock market don’t return, thereby missing out on recoveries.

While the study doesn’t uncover why some investors may be more vulnerable to emotional selling, financial experts say the findings raise further questions about how these factors — gender, age, marriage and family — affect behavior.

The research suggests these sellers have emotional overreactions defined by their decisions having the opposite of the intended effect, said Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist in Los Angeles. 

“Clearly, these are people who are trying to protect themselves,” she said.

While most investors are vulnerable to emotional choices, the findings from MIT align with other research showing men may be more prone to acting on their impulses. 

“Women are not as likely to take a huge decisive action like this because they’re not quite sure that their impulse or their feeling is correct,” Clayman said.

Men are 35% more likely to trade investments than women, according to a study from Fidelity, and trying to time the market often leads to lower performance. 

Moreover, those trading to achieve stability during volatile periods often see the opposite results, another study from the University of British Columbia finds. 

Control bias
Some males face pressure from an early age to “figure it out themselves,” which may trigger a control bias, or thinking that can influence results when they can not, said certified financial planner Teresa Bailey, wealth strategist at Waddell &amp; Associates in Nashville, Tennessee.  

“They sometimes feel that if they know enough about a subject, they should be able to control the outcome,” she said. “Unfortunately, there are far more variables at play when attempting to time the market.”

And once these investors get lost, it can be tough to seek guidance if they feel it’s their role to solve the problem on their own, she said.

Checks and balances
As humans primed with survival instincts, it can be challenging to avoid “fight or flight” responses like hitting the sell button when stocks plummet, Clayman said.

However, someone possibly more susceptible to panic selling may want to create a system of checks and balances, such as calling a peer or discussing the decision with a partner, she said, to protect themselves from emotional responses.

“We are not very accurate at assessing our actual threat response when we think about it ahead of time,” Clayman said. “Most of us freak out way more than we think.”

Intel - how is this not undervalued ? I understand Amd and Nvda have taken some market share for themselves and the deal with Apple ended last year, aside from this I believe the company is solid and should not be trading anywhere near the p/e it currently is 

Dell - seems like a solid move with the 5 bil buyback taking place, technicals are strong 

Mrk - Merck and Co seems a bit undervalued and the technicals are showing buy, nice dividend, slow mover but nice for the long term

Yeti Holdings - liking the breakdown we are seeing and I will be waiting for the right time to add this one, love their products, low p/e, nice strong trend, what is not to like ???? Maybe they should merge with crox and run together!!!! 

AbbVie - I like the weekly chart coming back down to the 50 ma for a buy, looks like a big cup and handle forming, adding this along with AZN

20,investing,bestzec,Leave no Buffett behind. A case for $TEVA Pharmaceuticals coming back with a vengeance,"Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Generics…

Wait no, the company debt

Wait actually, the opioid lawsuits

Okay there is a room full of elephants and we’re over the weight limit so let’s let them out one at a time.

**Generics:**

As everyone and their deceased great grandmother likes to point out, margins for generics are thin. However, fast food margins are thin too but we still get Mickey D’s and Wendy’s all the time and they are doing well. Thin margins may be a barrier to navigate around, but it does not prevent success if the overall market and the company’s market share is big enough. Thin margins is a deterrent for new competition and a barrier to entry for new players in the field and an already established behemoth like TEVA will be that much harder to knock down by a newcomer. Furthermore, unlike the fast food consuming population that die early from heart disease and diabetes, preventing the overall fast food industry from growing as they lose their customers (not to mention (yes I’m mentioning it) the growing trend of eating healthily which helps my next point), the growing aging population need more and more affordable drugs (cough generics) to stay alive and performant in the bedroom. Guess which company has a super good, affordable generic viagra drug… That’s right it’s TEVA.

Viagra is clearly not the only drug I’m on right now. You guessed it, the other one is adderall, a shit ton of it. I’m popping them like tic tacs. And it’s the TEVA brand of course. As more and more people have a harder time focusing due to navigating the stresses and distractions of life in a pandemic, while competition at every aspect of life (school, work, sex life) is at an all time high, they are diagnosed with ADHD and will need generic adderall that they can afford. Theres also a more recent booming emergence for needing copious amounts of adderall as new, unexperienced traders join the stock and crypto markets to invest and lose all their money and stare at charts all day, which requires focus for a solid 8-9 hours and can only be done by means of taking a lot of adderall.

Did I mention the stress that comes from all these aspects of life? Because TEVA has a Xanax generic to help with that too. I’ll be taking that later when I’m ready to go to sleep.

Medically licensed pill prescribers are in on this too. They are raking in the dough. Just ask my psychiatrist. A 5 minute phone conversation on a monthly basis is all I need to replenish all of my prescriptions. No medical checks or anything like that needed either based on my experience. He gets paid over $500 through insurance for these 5 minute interactions. It is easy to find pill pushers to provide the licensed drugs we all know and love, and need.

Oh and if you’re not sold on that, then maybe some medical weed will help lower your guard. If you have cancer or some other disease, TEVA can provide you with some generically licensed weed to ease your pain. But bestzec, isn’t weed becoming legalized everywhere? Maybe, but it’s a slow process, and it can still take years for most states and countries to legalize it. Furthermore, even if it was legal everywhere, there are a few important things to consider. It is expensive as shit in states that legalized it. I’m talking $100s of dollars for a few edibles that may last for only a few days. They already make it expensive to begin with and then tax the shit out of it for good measure. Good luck getting enough supply for your daily needs without going bankrupt. Also, many of these dispensaries and the weed that they sell are not FDA approved and is made by unlicensed or inconsistent producers. If I’m paying $100s of dollars that weed better be good and better work. I don’t want some unmixed batch where half my chocolates are only good for cavities and the other half puts me in the hospital. If I can get a pill pusher to prescribe me some regulated weed that I know is consistent, healthy, FDA approved and has insurance covering the cost, then I would much rather do that than going bankrupt and ending up in the hospital.

Generics sales are expected to grow over 25% (With everything mentioned earlier, I expect a much higher revenue growth than 25%, but maybe that’s just from my own consumption) over the next 5 years and TEVA is one of only a few big sellers in this field. This translates to increases in billions of revenues for TEVA as a large portion of TEVA’s revenues comes from generics.

**The company debt:**

Teva has a lot of debt. Like a lot. Even more than I have in the bank. However, looking at their debt chart, they have been reducing it every year since it spiked in 2016. At this rate they can bring it back to the levels of 2015 in about 6 years. Debt is only a problem if the interest is high and you’re not making any money to pay it off, but TEVA’s revenues alone for one year are almost as much as its current debt. Now I know revenues are not profits, but if they reduce some operating expenses (which they have been trimming the fat over the past few years) as well as their generics market keeps growing, they’ll be able to reduce the debt even faster. Lastly, a point about debt in general and why it is not so bad when the interest is low (which it is especially these days). With inflation on the rise and Printer Powell setting his printers on overdrive at an exponential pace for the past few years, printing 40% of the money US has ever had in 2020 alone, covering low interest debt made at historical costs/prices gets easier as value of money is adjusted to today’s prices (This is also a reason why TEVA’s stock price decline for a decade with inflation going haywire is very suspicious). The point is that TEVA is still making a shit ton of money ($17B in 2019) and are managing and reducing their debt.

**Opioid lawsuits:**

There’s been headlines making the news about progress around these lawsuits. The bigger companies like J&amp;J are reaching settlements saying they are prepared to pay around $5 B dollars. So let’s do some ratios. If a giant company like J&amp;J, that’s worth $430 B market cap is prepared to only pay $5 B, then Teva, which is completely undervalued and only worth $10 B, should be settling for around \~ $116 M. Even if it was $0.5 B, it would still just be a drop in the bucket of their revenues and they can cover that in 1 quarter alone. Because TEVA also has debt and a low market cap, they can argue to reduce the settlement cost to a reasonable amount. They are not going to charge $TEVA with a $10 Billion dollar fine when J&amp;J which is 43 times bigger is settling for only $5 Billion.

Are there any elephants left? I’m sure there are, there always are. Or maybe the ones mentioned are still in the room. So go ahead and bring them up in the comments.

**Onwards to the valuation:**

What’s valuable? Getting into undervalued assets; not accurately valued or overvalued assets that are at or around all time high prices.

You think i’m going to suggest buying something at all time high price? hell no. Even if it is accurately valued. Not interested. Amazon at 2 Trillion dollars? Apple at 2 Trillion? FB at 1 Trillion? Any other S&amp;P 100 stock? No thanks (I know most of you probably have some of these stocks. I am not saying they should go down in value, just that at Trillions of dollars market cap maybe they are at the very least accurately valued? And less likely to 2x-5x in price in the next few years which would bring some of them to 10 Trillion dollars market cap if they do. Not to mention (again mentioning) their leadership unloading Billions of dollars in shares on current buyers. Not interested in being Bezos’s ex-wife’s bagholder as she dumps her billions, along with Bezos himself, at all time high on the vulnerable retail market).

Now looking at the price graph over the past couple decades, it’s more than likely that if you bought and held TEVA then you’re in the red. Even the one true Buffett is in the red based on when he bought his TEVAs. But have no fear Mr. Buffett, I’m coming back for you.

What I like about TEVA is that I think it is grossly undervalued based on its current and historical price and compared to other pharma companies valuations. It looks like it has been oversold for some time and this is the accumulation period. Buying it now is pretty much buying it at an all time low as it is clearly at a period of accumulation at the $8-$10 range in the past couple years. Buyers have an opportunity to get shares at a cost that people had 20 years ago, all while inflation has been rampantly ravaging the dollar. I’ve been DCAing for some time to bring my cost basis way down.

**A few finishing notes to depart with:**

Teva has also been revamping their leadership. The current CEO is a family man from Denmark and everyone likes Denmark.

There is also a lot of price manipulation happening behind the scenes. The hedge funds have strong control of the stock price so be careful of buying options and holding your call options that expire on Fridays when the price is close to a strike price. They always bring it below so the options expire worthless. They’ve been preventing breakouts upwards for some time during this accumulation period but I doubt they will hold it much longer as more and more people are accumulating.

Lastly, looking at the trend of Institutional Ownership and Shareholders that filed forms with the SEC (fintel) over the past 7 years it looks very promising as almost all the shares are now being held strong and there will be a share shortage soon for people trying to get in cheap as TEVA recovers. That’s right, this is not a short squeeze play, at least not yet. There is a lot of institutional owners, many of which are in the red, and no one wants to sell at a loss so most of them probably want to hold till at least $20. If they’ve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they’ll keep holding for the price recovery.

For awhile I have been kicking some things around to find a good all around portfolio. While I know backtesting is so limited to what the future holds it's still interesting. 

If I were to take this approach my ideal portfolio if going by past history would be 30% schg (vug), 25% schd, 45% tlt rebalanced roughly every quarter. From Jan. 2012 the cagr is 12.5% vs the 16.3% of the sp500. The drawdown however is -6% of the 3 fund portfolio vs the -19.6% of the sp500. With a Sharpe ratio of 1.53 and sorting ratio of 3.15 in that same time. While I don't advocate bonds in everyday portfolios I would think it be a good idea for some kind of protection when using margin just my thoughts. 

I know people are going to throw out qyld, quadfectas, and the ridiculous leveraged builds which I like but again not for margin and seeing even nusi had a lower draw than the model above with a much lower return the search is still on.

I don't know if this has already been addressed here but since the crypto market got it's bull run stalled I've been investing some profits of my other passive sources in an AI marketing bot.

I've tried some Crypto Trading bots as well and I'm currently up 24% on both I use but they were paid bots.

I don't want to be here sharing referral links and websites, just posting so that since you guys like passive this is truly passive as the bot takes care of everything. On the last few months all I had to do was reinvest what I didn't want to withdraw and let it run for me.

If someone is interested you can pm me for more info or just do a quick research on this kind of income.

Currently working with 25-35% monthly apy which means $1.25 to $1.35 for every dollar invested.

For anyone willing to try you can get a 50$ Voucher from me (not free as it has to be paid when withdrawing) just to try it out and see for yourself.  
My stats of the bot I'm using:

**My Stats:**

**Advertising Budget:** $9790.23 ($50 voucher used, and topped up with Crypto via Binance)

**Time Up So Far:** 64 days

**Amount Spent:** $5746.14

**Cashback:** $12294.05

**Profit**: $6547.91

Didn't spend more because I didn't trust it when I first found it but won't actually need to top up more since I'm quite happy as it is going and the Australian law ( where the bot runs ) doesn't let you invest more than 10k at once using the said bot.

There's also a full video explaining how it works and how you manage to profit with the marketing bot for the one's looking to understand the basics behind this source of passive income.

We took that and set screens for backtesting at a cut-off of 15% of market cap spent on R&amp;D.  This is rare for companies to do but nonetheless it happens. 

From there we took the Russell 3000 and took out the companies that don't report R&amp;D expenses. 

Then we took out companies that had high short interest to avoid companies that analysts/funds determined were spending irresponsibly. 

Most companies that remain are health care and tech, and most are smaller. Therefore, I wouldn't build an entire portfolio around this but it's a nice addition to a portfolio. I'll be adding 5 stocks into my Roth and rebalancing each quarter, which were the backtesting criteria we used for:

\- 29.1% CAGR

\- 10.3 standard deviation of results

\- 52% high CAGR for a 3-yr increment

\- 1% low CAGR for a 3-yr increment

To get this data we took FactSet data which accounts for look-ahead and survivorship biases, and backtested it from Jan. 2000 until today. We didn't want to just do a straight 2000-2021 backtest because no one will keep a strategy going for 21 years until it pays off.   
Therefore, to backtest, we ""walked back"" 3 year tests from Sept 2021 to Sept 2018, then Sept 2018 to Sept 2015, etc. This went back to 2000.  From there we switched to Jan 2000 and walked back up to 2021 (Jan 2000-2003, '03 to '06, etc).   
Then we did this with 5 year windows (Sept. 2021 back to 2016, 2016 back to 2011, etc.) all the way to Sept. 2001, and then Jan. 2000 back up to 2020.

Right now today a BRAND NEW Tesla Model 3 is about the cheapest car on the road to own.    Sounds crazy, most people still see Tesla as a rich kids toy but i've looked at all the numbers, battery degradation, overall cost, resale, etc  and a new Tesla is a really wise investment for most people.   


If they redo the EV tax credit (US taxpayers) it becomes a no brainer.   


Question is, when will most people realize this?  


Unlike ICE cars and most other durable goods, EV's have a huge margin for continued cost reduction.  They will keep getting better and cheaper.   


Likewise, once the commercial truck makers break the 650 mile barrier, that sector will flip overnight.

84,investing,nobjos,Should you follow insider transactions? - I analyzed 4000+ insider trades made over the last 4 years and benchmarked the performance against S&amp;P 500. Here are the results!,"There is an old saying on Wall Street.

&gt;There are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.

If you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - downpayment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking. But when you are using your hard-earned money to purchase a stock, there is only one reason. You expect the stock price to go up!

It’s not a hard stretch to imagine that company insiders who are in high-ranking positions (CXO’s, VP’s, Presidents, etc.) would have a better understanding of the company and its expected future performance than any financial analysts out there who are just working with publically available data. So if these well-informed insiders are making significant stock purchases, does that mean they expect the stock price to shoot up soon?

In this week’s analysis let’s put this to the test. **Can you beat the market if you follow the stock purchases made by company insiders?**

___

**Data**

The data for this analysis was taken from **openinsider.com**

it’s a free-to-use website that tracks all the trades reported on SEC Form 4 \[1\]. While there are a lot of transactions that are reported daily to the SEC, I kept the following conditions to reduce noise in the data.

* Only transactions done by CXO’s, VP’s and Presidents (people who have a significant view of the company strategy and operations) are considered.
* A minimum transaction value of 100K
* The transaction should be purchase (Not a grant, gift, or purchase due to options expiration)

The financial data used in the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance.

___

**Analysis**

For all the transactions, I calculated the stock price change across different time periods (One Week, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6 Months &amp; 1 Year) and then benchmarked the returns against S&amp;P500 over the same time period.

My hypothesis for choosing different time periods was to understand at what point would you generate the maximum alpha (if we realize any) over the benchmark. All the results are checked for outliers so that one or two stocks are not biasing the whole result.

___

 **Results** 

**Return Comparison - Companies with Insider Buying vs SPY**

|Time Period|Insider Purchase Stock Returns|S&amp;P 500 Returns|Alpha|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1-Week|1.9%|\-0.3%|2.1%|
|1-Month|3.6%|2.0%|1.6%|
|3-Months|11.3%|6.6%|4.7%|
|6-Months|17.0%|11.9%|5.1%|
|1-Year|39.7%|22.1%|17.6%|

Surprisingly, if you had followed the insider purchases, you would have beaten SPY across all 5 different timeframes. The alpha generated would also have increased with increasing timeframe with the insider purchase trades beating the S&amp;P500 by a whopping 17.6% over the period of one year.

I have kept 1-year timeframe as my limit mainly due to two reasons. First, I started the analysis for identifying short-term plays, and secondly, given our entire dataset is over the last 4 years, anything more than 1 year would not have data for a significant chunk of our population which can affect the analysis.

___ 

**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the trades.

* The data I collected has a lot of small-cap companies which are inherently more risky than a large-cap index like S&amp;P500. Given our returns are not risk-adjusted, the alpha we are seeing here might just be due to the higher risk you are taking on the trades \[2\]
* The analysis is limited to the last 4 years of data during which the markets were predominantly in a bull run (except the Covid-19 crash)
* Finally, this assumes that you will buy an equal amount of stock whenever a company insider does a trade which might not be practical given our inherent biases and apprehensions\[3\]

___

**Conclusion**

Usually, insider purchases are used to gauge the overall market sentiment. A very high proportion of sells over buys signify that insiders are losing confidence in the stock/industry and it’s time to get out of that market.

This analysis shows that the individual trades can be used for identifying stocks that are worth buying by analyzing the insider purchase patterns. This should be just considered as a primer into the topic as SEC Form 4 has a treasure trove of information \[4\].

You may or may not implement this strategy based on your investment style. But at the very least, you should check for the insider transaction pattern before investing in a particular security!

**Footnotes and Existing Research**

\[1\] SEC Form 4 is what an insider file when he/she makes a transaction. It’s expected to be filed within 2 days, but I observed more delay than that in many cases. For the purpose of this analysis, I have considered transactions that were reported no later than 10 days.

Jeng and Richard Zeckhauser of Harvard found that insider purchases beat the market by 11.2% per year. Even after adjusting for the risk using the CAPM model, the returns beat the market by 8.5%

9,investing,HoleyProfit,Predicting Financial Crashes Using Discrete Scale Invariance [Research paper]," 

Read in full here - [arXiv:cond-mat/9903321v3 8 Jun 1999](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9903321.pdf)

**Introduction**

Two recent papers \[Johansen and Sornette, 1999a, Johansen et al., 2000\] have presented increasing evidence on the Oct. 1929, Oct. 1987, Hong-Kong Oct. 1987 crashes, on the Aug. 1998 global market events and on the 1985 Forex event on the US dollar, for the following hypothesis \[Sornette et al, 1996\] describing stock market crashes : we propose that they are caused by a slow build-up of long-range time correlations reflecting those between traders leading to a collapse of the stock market in one critical instant.

This build-up manifest itself as an over-all power law acceleration in the price decorated by “log-periodic” precursors. Here, “log-periodicity” refers to a sequence of oscillations with progressively shorter cycles of a period decaying according to a geometrical series.

In addition, extensive statistical tests have been performed \[Johansen et al., 2000, Johansen, 1997\] to show that the reported “logperiodic” structures essentially never occurred in ≈ 105 years of synthetic trading following a “classical” time-series model, the GARCH(1,1) model with student-t statistics, often used as a benchmark in academic circles as well as by practitioners. Thus, the null hypothesis that log-periodicity could result simply from random fluctuations is strongly rejected

**Conclusion**

We have presented a synthesis of the available empirical evidence in the light of recent theoretical developments for the existence of characteristic log-periodic signatures of growing bubbles in a variety of stock markets as well as currencies.

We have here documented 8 unrelated crashes from 1929 to 1998, on stock markets as diverse as the US, Hong-Kong or the Russian market and on currencies.

In addition, we have discovered a significant bubble on Wall Street ending in 1962 \[Johansen et al., 2000\] as well as “anti-bubbles”on the Nikkei since 1990 and the Gold (after the 1980 bubble maximum) \[Johansen and Sornette, 1999c\].

Quite unexpectedly, we have shown that the Russian bubble crashing 14 in Aug. 1997 had close to identical power law and log-periodic behaviour to the bubbles observed on Wall Street, the Hong-Kong stock market and on currencies.

To our knowledge, no major financial crash preceded by an extended bubble has occurred in the past 2 decades without exhibit a logperiodic signature.

In this context, note that the novel analysis of the Russian index presented here was motivated by Ilinski’s claim of a crash without log-periodic signature, which we have shown to be incorrect.

All these results, taken together with the remarkable robustness and consistency of the estimation of the exponent β as well as the more important statistics the scaling ratio λ, make the case for power law acceleration and log-periodicity very strong.

In our opinion, one can no more ignore these very specific and strong signatures which is characteristic of developing bubbles and this calls for further investigations to unravel in more depths the underlying economical, financial and behavioural mechanisms.

These different cases, together with the 1962 “slow event” as well as the “anti-bubbles”, show that the log-periodic critical theory applies both to bubbles ending in a sudden crash as well as to bubbles landing smoothly.

This is in fact a strong prediction of our rational model of imitative behaviour. What we have attempted here is not to explain why crashes happens or bubbles exists, but to quantify the process taking place during extended bubbles that very often lead to the rapid regime switching a crash represent. We have offered evidence that bubbles and anti-bubbles have log-periodic and power law characteristics and hence provides for a quantification of extended “moods” on the markets.

We have furthermore, provided a model which contains the observed signatures. Whether, as proposed, discrete scale invariance or some other mechanisms \[Sornette, 1998\] are responsible for the prominent log-periodic signatures observed, only a more detailed microscopic model can answer.",1632451430,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/puao0f/predicting_financial_crashes_using_discrete_scale/

23,investing,CryptoFilip,NIKE - earnings report and my opinion,"  

„Nike reports earnings tonight for their first financial quarter of 2022 (covering the months June-August 2021). The consensus revenue estimate calls for 12.54bn in revenue (1.6% q-o-q increase), with the highest estimate pegged at 12.9bn in revenue (4.6% q-o-q increase). Estimates call for EPS of 1.12, which has recently been revised downward slightly as people are worried about supply chain issues in Vietnam (more on that later).

Nike's brand strength and pricing power is unparalleled among retailers, and I think they will outdo the revenue expectations and see a decent upwards bump in price. Store reopenings in Europe and coastal USA should work in their favor this quarter, while they still benefit from tremendously strong digital channels.

**Store visits**

While May and June were comparatively weak, according to this data Nike did very well in July and August to make up for it. They outperformed especially in New York and California, while being approximately on par with Lulu in Texas and Florida. According to Linkedin, they have also increased their sales personnel by 3% over the past 6 months.

**Website visits**

Nike has also seen a nice uptick in website hits in recent months. According to Similarweb, their website had a total of 361.5 million from June-August, compared to 330 million in the previous 3 months, for a 10% increase 

**Risks**

This is probably one of the riskier plays I’ve posted here since expectations for Nike are actually quite high. The main reason I’m even posting it is that they dropped quite a lot in the past weeks and it’s looking oversold, and the overall market looks strong right now. Don’t bet the house on this one.

Nike had fantastic earnings and a huge jump 3 months ago, and is now trading a couple percent above that level. It's somewhat uncommon (but not unheard of) for stocks to have 2 big jumps after consecutive earnings reports.

The Put-call open interest ratio is skewed towards put, which indicates people are generally bullish. This play more or less goes along with the consensus view, which isn’t always the right move.

Supply chain issues might be worse than I estimate. Even if they aren’t, Nike might decide to lowball guidance to play it safe. I'm not Vietnamese, don't read Vietnamese, and don't know anyone in Vietnam. I have no idea how bad the supply chain issue will be - I am simply making an educated guess based on publicly available English-language sources.“",1632439014,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pu77l4/nike_earnings_report_and_my_opinion/

Quick q from a trading perspective. 

If you have one security that is listed and trade on different exchanges, i.e. has a London line / Australian line, or London line / ADR, etc... when fx'ing the share prices to a common currency, we'd expect them to trade in line with one another (law of one price, else arbitrage).

If the securities prices have been trading a siginificant spread over time - what would you attribute this to? Valuation of the sum of parts in the London book vs Aussie line being justified through their P/E? etc.

V curious to get others take on it, as my analysis attributes it to a valuation of the statements held in the region of the listing potentially explaining the differential. I wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything else!

31,investing,nafizzaki,US bond lobbies warn SEC of severe disruption under rule change,"Lobby groups are warning that activity in the world’s biggest bond market could grind to a halt at the end of this month without last-minute exemptions to an obscure 50-year-old rule in the US that has previously taken aim only at stocks.

Bond trade associations have written to regulators to say amended rules will have a “significant, deleterious effect” on government and corporate bond markets, and pleaded for an explicit reprieve, or more time to comply. The amendments were first proposed last year, but market participants assumed until recent months that the rules would continue to pertain to the stock market alone.

“We believe that such an application of the rule is overbroad and unnecessary”, wrote the Bond Dealers of America and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

The SEC’s 1971 statute, known as ‘rule 15c2-11’, governs the “publication or submission” of prices to buy and sell securities away from exchanges. Market participants have largely considered it an attempt to guard retail investors from predatory schemes and fraudulent activity in penny stocks. 

The rule requires broker dealers such as JPMorgan Chase and Citi to check a wide range of information on issuers, including quarterly and annual reports. Last year the SEC, then led by Jay Clayton, tweaked the rules for the first time in almost three decades, and included a requirement for the information to be publicly available.

“These retail investor-focused improvements to Rule 15c2-11 are long overdue,” said Clayton at the time, adding that advances in technology meant investors could be privy to more up-to-date information before trading.

The statute has never explicitly excluded bonds but, in practice, it has never applied to them in its 50-year existence. This has long suited a market where many corporate issuers are not listed on stock markets and do not routinely produce regular earnings reports. It is unclear what disclosures would be required for government bonds, such as those issued by the US Treasury.

But Michael Decker, vice-president of policy and research at BDA, said the SEC, led by new chief Gary Gensler, has confirmed the rules will also affect government and corporate bonds under the amendments outlined last year. Only municipal securities have an explicit exemption. 

“Here we are a matter of days away and very little work has been done. It is pretty clear to me that the SEC hasn’t really thought this through,” said Decker.

The SEC declined to comment. 

Rising awareness of the new requirements has sown confusion in the bond market as bankers, trading platforms and investors now face intense compliance demands ahead of an unforeseen month-end deadline. 

The concern is that without guidance or amendment from the SEC, trading in part of the bond market will cease when the rule comes into force at the end of this month, as broker dealers back away for fear of attracting an enforcement action from securities regulators. 

The SEC’s move comes at a time of increasing regulatory scrutiny of fixed income trading, with Gensler noting this month that he intends to bring greater efficiency and transparency to the market. 

Broker dealers are scrambling to understand how to gather, review and publish information on the companies whose bonds they trade. They are also questioning what counts as publication or submission of a quote on a bond — terms left undefined in the rule.

Bond trading has increasingly transitioned to trading on electronic venues, with prices streamed on screens. In an attempt to avoid publishing quotes, some market participants could shift trading back to phones until clearer guidance is available. 

“The risk is that if the broker dealers feel they can’t be in compliance based on the interpretation of their internal teams then they might be forced to stop quoting certain bonds to ensure they aren’t out of compliance,” said Kevin McPartland, head of research, market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates.",1632370009,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ptn7fi/us_bond_lobbies_warn_sec_of_severe_disruption/
42,investing,JPTrader604,Hotel Analysts or IBISWorld report from 2019,"Hey all, recently got access to IBISWorld. I've been trying to find the segmentation split (Domestic Leisure, International Leisure, Business, Events/Meetings). IBISWorld has it in their 2021 report, but I'm not sure if the numbers they give are the norm, or if it's skewed by COVID. It mentions ""The amount of travel decreased significantly in 2020 due to the spread of the COVID-19 (coronavirus). Consequently, the market segments of travel have shifted amid travel restrictions"". 

So I'm wondering if any Hotel analysts can confirm, or if anyone knows where I can get the 2019 Hotel/Motel Industry Report, or anything similar. I have always used government institution and third party agencies for my research, but something as discretionary as hotels seems to have limited information. A lot of it is locked behind pay walls. Any suggestions would be nice on how to research these types. Without further ado, here are the numbers incase there are hotel analysts who can simply confirm/deny these are normal, pre COVID numbers:

51,investing,ILikeTalkn2Myself,Ford partners with battery recycling and materials startup Redwood Materials amid EV push,"Ford Motor has tapped Redwood Materials to create a closed loop system for its upcoming deluge of electric vehicles — a partnership that will cover recycling production scrap and EVs at the end of their life as well as supplying the automaker with raw battery materials.

The deal comes as Ford adds more electric vehicles to its portfolio, including the Mustang Mach E that launched last year and the upcoming[ F-150 Lightning pickup truck](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/). Securing a supply of batteries — or the materials to make them — has prompted the automotive industry to partner with cell manufacturers and increasingly turn to companies like Redwood Materials.

Ford alone will require a hefty supply. The company’s global plans for battery electric vehicle calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell capacity by 2030, according to the automaker. That is roughly 10 plants’ worth of capacity. Ford has previously said that 140 GWh will be required in North America, with the balance dedicated to other regions, including Europe and China.

“Closing the loop for us in our end-of-life products and allowing those to re-enter the supply chain will help us drive down costs,” Lisa Drake, Ford’s chief operating officer in North America, said during a press briefing. “Of course, it’ll help us reduce the reliance on importing a lot of the materials that we use today when we build the batteries. And then it’ll reduce the mining of raw materials, which is going to be incredibly important in the future as we start to scale on this space.”

All of this, Drake says, will made EVs cheaper and more sustainable.

Redwood Materials recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. The company, which was founded and is led by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, says it can recover, on average, more than 95% of the elements like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper.

Redwood then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC’s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses. Redwood’s first automotive partnership was secured earlier this year with electric commercial vehicle manufacturer Proterra.

“The risk is that we find ourselves in a situation perhaps a little bit similar to current global semiconductor shortage if we don’t plan ahead, and if we aren’t strategic about the production capacity and the right regions at the right time,” Straubel said during the briefing.  

Under the partnership announced Wednesday, Redwood Materials will initially work with Ford to set up recycling within the automaker’s battery production network and then funnel the recovered raw materials back to the manufacturer to be used in batteries. While Ford didn’t provide specific details, that likely means working with its battery cell supplier SK.

In May, Ford and SK signed an initial agreement to create a joint venture — to be called BlueOvalSK — to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours annually in traction battery cells and array modules, starting mid-decade.

The ultimate aim of the Redwood Materials-Ford partnership is to touch the entire battery lifecycle from recycling production scrap and supplying Ford with materials to creating recycling options for the end-of-life vehicles. That last piece is complex because Ford will no longer own its EVs, many of which will have multiple owners before they’re ready for the scrap heap.

The deal follows a string of announcements in recent months by Redwood Materials. The company recently raised more than $775 million — a round that TechCrunch learned includes $50 million from Ford. (The company initially announced the round was [more than $700 million](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/).)

It also revealed in September plans to [expand its business](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/jb-straubels-redwood-materials-is-expanding-into-the-battery-materials-business/) beyond battery recycling and into the production of critical battery materials at a new million-square-foot factory in the United States. Redwood wants to produce cathodes and anode foils, the building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure.

The factory, for which the company is currently scouting a location, would likely be dedicated to the production of cathodes. Redwood has said it intends for the factory to ramp up to 100 gigawatt hours of capacity to produce cathode material, enough for one million electric vehicles by 2025.

How does career in private equity really chart up?

Is PE a number crunching job (at junior level positions) with negotiations; only when you go higher up?  
How necessary is it necessary to be clever and street smart in order to succeed in private equity?

Do investment banks and PE firms take analysts from regular or lower level colleges such as Hult or DePaul or does Buy Side Finance only put attention only to Ivy League institutions.

Or

Is double Masters a good opinion, to get your foot in the door now thru any college giving Masters and after 5-6 years pursue MBA from a Ivy League to shoot your shot

When I started though, I was focused on the bigger ones like FCX and NEM, since these are stocks that you can feel sure and secure in my perspective.

Though recently I came across some juniors that I invested on. Among them is Fortitude Gold ([FTCO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FTCO/)), which despite being a small producer, has no debts. They[ ](https://www.fortitudegold.com/news/fortitude-gold-increases-monthly-dividend)[reported positive metallurgical test results](https://www.fortitudegold.com/news/fortitude-gold-reports-positive-golden-mile-metallurgical-test-results) from its Golden Mile property with column leach tests reporting up to 85% gold recovery. I got[ Lithium Corporation](https://www.lithiumcorporation.com/) ($LTUM) because I think there is probably a better return on energy metals in the future. ie lithium, cobalt, graphite, etc. in my perspective.

Also got some from[ Collective Mining](https://collectivemining.com/) ([CNL.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNL.V/)). The announcement from last month detailed results about their recently discovered a high-grade silver channel sampling and they already started drilling last week. Their cash burn is also impressively low, making the company set for a long timeline. There is a possibility that their next results could be a bigger catalyst than the previous discovery, since they recently announced a potential gold porphyry stockwork system at their Victory target area.

I know it’s kind of risky investing on these but I believe it’s a high-risk high-reward thing. They entail higher risk but we cannot ignore their strong profit potential especially with those who already started drilling and are showing great promise.

l'idée est surtout de développer des outils décentralisés avec Hedera, pas d'augmenter le volume de transactions spéculatives qui n'est finalement qu'une niche, ils veulent ajouter de la valeur dans les transactions et augmenter le volume (ex : décentralisé le KYC, le paiement, le track record des opérations et leur traitement comptable, l'emprunte carbone digitale par utilisateur, etc…) le DLT de Hedera est le plus régulé au monde, (une fois que les régulateurs vont secouer le cocotier on verra ceux qui restent en place)Un régulateur peut imposer un arrêt net des opérations des acteurs décentralisés et donc tué son business du jour au lendemain… ce sera pas le cas avec un partenaire comme Hedera

Token côté chez Bittrex probablement le 26 octobre - un échange Bittrex puis step by step. Les bourses n'ont presque pas de liquidités et les teneurs de marché sont obligés d'adapter leurs stratégies en fonction du volume journalier et de l'attrait sur le jeton ou la crypto. Il faut donc d'abord pouvoir absorber les échanges sur un échange et attendre que l'élan augmente avant de se projeter sur d'autres échanges.

72,investing,MrIndira,Why is no one talking about the Credit Default SWAPs tied to Evergrande's USD 300 Billion Debt,"A credit default swap is "" a financial contract whereby a buyer of corporate or sovereign debt in the form of bonds attempts to eliminate possible loss arising from default by the issuer of the bonds. This is achieved by the issuer of the bonds insuring the buyer’s potential losses as part of the agreement. ""   


Essentially, it is insurance for the creditor in the case of default from a debtor. 

A creditor can get into these credit default swaps contracts, where a creditor pays a fixed amount to another party (the insurer) and when/if the debtor to the creditor defaults  the insurer will step in to make the creditor whole.

Now, people have known about Evergrande and their liquidity issues for about a year. Investors (Debtors) would have purchased these credit default swap contracts for Evergrande.   


Now, apparently this week is full of holidays for China - so TOMORROW, when a good chunk of China is back to work AND when China is expected make an announcement as to whether or not they will SAVE Evergrande or let it default, THEN we  will find out how the markets truly respond to this catastrophe.  


**What would be the effect of the credit default swaps on the rest of the financial markets?** Obviously, we don't know who the insurers are, but I'd imagine that that insurer is probably issuing securities out of its pooled credit default payments. Like all insurance companies.  
FYI, Credit Default Swaps are what really hurt AIG during the 2008 housing crisis.

Side note: Everyone is expecting China to step in and save Evergrande or at least prevent contagion effects throughout the chinese markets.

Worse still, the response will be led by individuals who are only versed in the same failed ideologies that brought us to where we are now. Although questions of underlying ideology may be dismissed by “practical” individuals who pride themselves on being “independent thinkers,” Austrian economics accounts for the degree to which our intellectual environment directly guides policy and institutional frameworks. In the aftermath of the challenging times that may be ahead, the only way to build a stronger, more prosperous, and more stable future will be with an ideological revolution.

I am looking to make my first real investments in the stock market, I am doing some research into sectors that I feel might benefit in the long term.

My area of competency is technology, my theory is that most governments are moving towards Net-Zero emissions in the next few years forcing the sale of Electric Vehicles. I don’t think the price of batteries will come down all too much as historically there has been minimal improvement in the space - although I do support this innovation I think cars will be expensive for next few decades.

This leads me to believe that most consumers will finance a vehicle rather than selling it, and this seems to be a popular option even in today’s market.

I am trying to find companies that lend money primarily for the purpose of a car loan but searching through google just leads me to endless advertisements. I am really struggling to find good information about how the business model actually works.

Can anyone shed some light on this subject? Do car makers deal with the financial services themselves? Do people go to banks for this or are there a list of companies I can compare to gauge the historic performance of this model to see if it is the right investment for me?

I hear people say that dividends give them an option on whether to reinvest in a company or take home the money.

None of those arguements hold any weight at all. A dividend has a tax attached to it eating into your returns. A dividend literally eats into the value of your stock; 1% dividend is 1% decrease in stock value. You can literally sell the stock to collect your money on a regular basis, we have fractional shares you know.

I wasn't there for the ride up, so just being there for the ride down doesn't seem that appealing.

Hoping to at least put the rest of the large sum in when it's near a low, so I am there for the ride up for that part.

I know time in the market is more important than timing the market overall. And I am doing that overall. But I wasn't there for the ride up, so I am somewhat conflicted.

What do you guys think and are we heading down a bit? Since I waited so long already missing out on all the gains, might it not make sense to wait a little more and actually go in at a lower point, to not end up going in only at highs?

I'm a young guy with quite a lot of money very regularly coming in due to a Web3 project I have taking off. I live modestly and have been putting probably 80% of my income into investments. I've set a pretty comfortable risk tolerance, and my time horizon is more than 20 years.

I've found myself buying into $VOO on regular intervals lately. It feels safe, doesn't take a lot of time, etc. I've gradually been scaling into using margin, because I strongly believe that, over my time horizon, the returns I'll get from an S&amp;P index fund will beat out the 0.75% interest rate they offer me.

However, I learned about leveraged S&amp;P ETFs recently, such as $SPUU, $SSO, $UPRO. These mostly seem to have a higher expense ratio than $VOO, but my understanding is that these are able to achieve a similar leverage affect of using margin in the way I am, without using margin.

I was just wondering if I'm understanding this correctly. If I'm comfortable going in 1:1 on margin into $VOO, am I then better off just buying $SPUU and not using margin instead (assuming the expense ratios are in my favor). Are there any differences or disadvantages of these leveraged ETFs that I'm not understanding, when compared to going into $VOO on margin?",1632172883,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ps44zb/leveraging_into_an_sp_index/

So obviously, today’s market drop doesn’t concern me in the least.

I have another $10,000 in a taxable account that I use for fun things: beer money, casino trips, video game purchases, spa treatments, etc.

This is money I am not investing for the long term. I will spend this down between now and retiring. I am more interested in capital preservation.

For this reason I invested this money in an “all-weather” portfolio, an idea pioneered by [billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/) and popularized in [Tony Robbins’ book “Money: Master the Game](https://fourminutebooks.com/money-master-the-game-summary/).

This portfolio is designed to make money in most any market and rarely ever lose money.

Here is how I have invested this $10,000:

* 30% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)
* 40% iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT)
* 15% iShares 7 – 10 Year Treasury ETF (IEF)
* 7.5% SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD)
* 7.5% PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC)

So far this portfolio has performed fine and I have been happy with the performance. 

I have not had a chance to see the all-weather portfolio put to the test…until today.

As I saw red everywhere today I opened up my Robinhood app with curiosity to check my balance.

I have no idea how my IRA did today and honestly don’t want to look but my all-weather portfolio was actually UP today by 0.02%.

I recommend this portfolio for short-term goals (savings for a house down payment, for example) or as a hedge against sequence of returns risk.

# Competition

  

Innoviz, Microvision, Velodyne, Aeva, Ouster, Aeye, Luminar

  

Cepton has a huge leg up on its competitors by having the largest production award (GM) as well as partnership with a key tier 1 supplier (Koito). According to both Cepton's investor presentation and S-4 filing, these things take considerable time (2+ years) &amp; have incredible competition (at least 30 lidars considered for GM production award). No other lidar company expects deployment on a significant number of vehicle models (especially non-luxury) anytime in the near future.

  

Microvision (MVIS) has completed their **prototype** lidar in April 2021. Cepton finished their prototype in 2017, and is currently fine tuning the mass production process. Futhermore, Microvision recently claimed that they would win the markets by being cheap and selling their lidars for an AVERAGE of less than $1000. Cepton lidars are &lt; $500 with the Nova lidar being &lt; $100. Needless to say, Cepton is not concerned with competition from Microvision at the moment.

  

Another interesting fact I noticed: many Velodyne and Innoviz leaders have left and decided to join Cepton.

# Bear Cases 

  

The merger falls apart. This seems quite unlikely as both Cepton and GCAC have experienced leadership &amp; backgrounds. 

  

Cepton's deal with GM falls through. While again this is theoretically possible, the chances seem very small based on the investor presentation &amp; S-4 filing. Cepton had been in talks with GM for years before the announcement, and GM went through an extensive selection process of over 40 other lidar companies. Furthermore, Cepton is already partnered and supported by Koito, a Tier 1 supplier already approved and supplying parts for GM vehicles. 

  

The AV market is a bust. Cepton is currently focused on mass-market Lidar serving ADAS, which is a very real &amp; growing market. While it is true that currently the lidar market is pretty saturated, there is definitely an addressable market for ADAS in vehicles in the next 5 years. Cepton's ability to actually land the largest known Lidar production deal is nothing to scoff at.

# Conclusion

  

Cepton has strong fundamentals, landed impressive deals and partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout leader in the lidar market. ADAS (safety &amp; assist) is not as sexy as AV (self driving), but there is a clear market for it TODAY, and Cepton has already taken the first step with the landmark deal to supply lidar for multiple GM cars.

  

As of writing this post, GCAC is trading at $9.89, and is a relatively low-risk investment as SPAC's typically have a $10 floor due to the ability to redeem the stock at closing of the merger for $10.

While the lidar &amp; SPAC markets are not so hot at the moment, I still see Cepton as undervalued at the moment, and the situation as a great low-downside investment opportunity. If Cepton succeeds with its engagements with all top 10 OEM's, then this current price would be one hell of a steal. 

  
  
  

**Game plan**  

I bought &amp; plan to hold shares for several years. 

You can also just play the merger - buy now, then hold until the merger date &amp; decide then whether to keep or sell.
  
- Buy shares, GCAC will change to CPTN after the merger. Shares will be 1:1
- Warrants, GCACW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50
- Options trading - buying calls &amp; selling puts

  
  

**TL;DR:** 

Cepton quietly landed massive deals &amp; partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout lidar company. Currently GCAC is trading at &lt;$10, which is usually the floor for SPACs. This seems like a fairly low-risk low-downside investment, with great upsides at the moment since awareness of Cepton is so low.

6,investing,mekonsodre14,China’s growing property crisis: a look onto a few spill over scenarios,"Assumptions…
- 70% of wealth in China is held in property (elsewhere average is btw. 20 to 35%)
- Evergrande’s international payment obligations are due on Thursday
- 1/3 of current China GDP is created by construction and property related activity (builders, materials/commodities, industrials/machines, services, etc) 
- China property market (sales) has been lagging for some months already
- a lot of Chinese investors have been harmed by the regulatory actions of Chinese tech companies, hence sentiment sensibility is heightened



Outlines of 3x spill over scenarios 
----------------------------
1.) Unorderly containment + large spill over
Evergrande default spills over to other property and real estate firms in China with unorderly containment, leading to a considerable decline in many related industries (incl. services). Property prices in China would collapse and lead to a moderate sell-off -&gt; the rather significant negative GDP impact would hit Chinese wallets directly, leading to severe repercussions for China-focused firms (global) and China’s future growth in general

-&gt; large impact on international markets (most sectors), global crisis potential, quicker decline of China’s GDP, FED would have to delay tapering 


2.) Orderly containment - moderate spill over
Evergrande default spills over to other property firms in China with orderly containment, resulting in a moderate decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the GDP decline would impact China’s domestic spending/consumption power and lead to a medium-long term cooling of the China property market

-&gt; moderate impact on international markets (few sectors only), less long-term effects, slow-paced decline of China’s core GDP


3.) Orderly containment - small spill over
Evergrande default spills over to a few selected property firms in China (with large leverage). China’s gov steps in quickly and aggressively to ensure an orderly containment with a direct relief to calm down markets, resulting in a small decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the slight GDP decline would result in rather short-term consequences for China’s domestic spending/consumption power. The CCP would at least manage to keep property prices stable, the spill over effects would be barely visible.

I’m long $VALE and have been since $10/share. They’re trading at a 35% discount from their high a month ago($22) at $15/share and just announced a $1.5 (10%!!) dividend. 

This feels like free $ to me, and it will be since I own so much stock.


Now, I have more $ in a brokerage account solely dedicated to derivatives. Is there any way that I could simultaneously bet on the stock price rising or not falling while also being able to suck up much of this dividend?

10,investing,InvestorCowboy,[DD] Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM),"**Introduction**

The recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a “once in a generation” investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water.

**Semiconductor Industry Threat**

\[Source\]([https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/2002/06/reducing-water-usage-in-semiconductor-manufacturing/](https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/2002/06/reducing-water-usage-in-semiconductor-manufacturing/))

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

📷

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

Thank me later :-),"**EcoWatt (ETW) is the first Governance Token backed by green power and income generating assets dedicated to increasing Token value and delivering social impact.**

**Initially 1 EcoWatt Token = 1 Watt of installed power (Wp), which increases in value as the growing Watt power exceeds the fixed Token supply**

ATM there is the Pre-Sale going on. You are able to buy the coins for 0.3 EUR / token. When it's going to be listed in public, the price per token will be 1.20 /EUR. So you get easy a 4x for nothing.

69,investing,wallstjunky,What Questions To Ask Your Potential Investment Advisor/Financial Advisor,"I know many of you reading this are DIY investors, and that is absolutely great!  For some of you, it might make sense now or later down the road to consider pursuing an Investment Advisor/Financial Advisor.  I myself, work for a Boutique RIA firm as a portfolio manager, and am in no way soliciting my business, but instead, I put together a list of questions to use as a guide for the ""Interview Process"".  Before I get into it, my recommendation if you choose to hire an Advisor, make sure they are a Fee-Only Fiduciary, this is usually the most transparent type of advisor out there.  This can protect you from being sold crappy investment products that put money in your advisors pocket that likely aren't best suited for you.

1.       Tell me about your qualifications and experience? 

You NEED to know how long your advisor has been in the industry and what education and designations they have.  The CFP, CFA, and CPA are some of the most prestigious and well-recognized designations that an advisor can have.

2.       What problems can you solve and what services do you provide?

Financial advisors can perform a multitude of different functions, so finding the one that fits your needs and has the expertise you are looking for.  You want an advisor is isn’t just one-dimensional (i.e. only selling insurance products) but rather can offer many different types of advice like real estate, equities, alternatives, etc.

3.       Who else stands to gain from the services you provide me?

You want a clear understanding of any other third parties that aim to benefit off the services your potential advisor is giving you.  Advisors that sell a certain product, mutual fund, or policy typically have a pre-arranged relationship that usually comes in the form of compensation when providing these products.

4.       Have you ever been professionally disciplined?

FINRA, CFA, state agencies, and CFP boards keep records on the disciplinary history of candidates and advisors.  You should verify with these entities if your potential advisor has ever been reprimanded or professionally disciplined.

5.       How secure are your services?

Cybersecurity is a serious issue, so you want to make sure what systems your advising company has in place, how the information is store, what software partners they are working with, and ultimately how is your sensitive data being stored.  At the end of the day, the Financial Advisor is going to have a lot of your personal financial data, so you just want to make sure how secure it really is.

6.       How much control do I have over decisions made?

FAs have different scopes of ability and services.  Some have complete discretion and control over the account with no client input, while other FAs serve as more of an educator and the client does have a lot of input.  If you are looking for someone to make all the investment-management decisions for you, then find an advisor that can serve in that capacity.  If, on the other hand, you are more of a DIY type investor, find an advisor that can serve as a second set of eyes while still giving you the ability to pick what securities or investment vehicles to include in your portfolio.

7.       How are you getting paid?

For any reputable FA can answer this question.  There isn’t one right answer for the fee structure that is best for you, but you definitely want one of transparent.  There are so many types of fee structures, so try to understand how your FA actually gets paid.

8.       Ask him or her to explain a concept to you

This allows you an opportunity to see their ability to communicate effectively.  A large part of the financial planning process comes in the delivery of the plan itself.  Choosing an advisor who can not only develop a comprehensive financial plan but also deliver it in a way that is well understood.

Below are five concept-oriented questions to consider asking:

* What is passive vs. active investing?
* How do you determine how much of my money should be in stocks vs. bonds?
* What is a [laddered bond](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/accounts_products/investment/bonds/individual_bonds/bond_ladders) portfolio?
* How do you determine how much money I can safely withdraw each year without running out?

89,investing,jyoung1,Three types of tech companies,"&amp;#x200B;

**There are three reasons that are preventing tech companies from growing faster:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Tech companies that don't have enough money.**

These are generally start-ups, or high-burn hungry tech companies. 

This manifests in two different ways:

1. Companies actively burning money, to show ""growth"" that is unsustainable.
2. Companies actively choosing to spend money, because they know it is going to pay off in the future (e.g. amazon spending billions on infrastructure). 

Avoid the former. Invest in the later.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Tech companies that don't have enough talent.**

This manifests in two different ways.

1. High quality people don't want to work there. (avoid these companies). 
2. The company grew so fast, and hiring is still catching up (hyper growth co's). E.g. Zoom, Instacart, DoorDash, after covid. 

Avoid the former reason (not easily solved). Invest in the later (easily solved).

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Tech companies that don't have enough opportunities to spend.**

These are companies that just don't have enough opportunities to deploy $ or people. Typically companies with poor markets.

Avoid this category, *unless*, you see a market shift or external shift in the market.",1632079862,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/prepat/three_types_of_tech_companies/

I have held TQQQ since before the crash of 2020, and while it was a bumpy ride, I've continued making it a bigger component of my portfolio, happily enjoying the returns.

99,investing,th3cr1t1c,No Free Lunch: A Brief Primer on the Cost vs. Value of Information,"There is no end to the number of blogs and Youtube videos that convince retail investors they too can be experts.  But what, really, is the value of that information?

There are three reasons earnings-based analyses are so popular in the investing world, even among some quasi-professionals, despite the fact that Discounted Cash Flow analysis is the preferred model for valuation across the entire industry^(1):

1. Earnings is the most readily available company metric on the internet.
2. Ratios are simple; analyses are complicated.
3. This information is cheap.

Beyond Time Value of Money, there's no more valuable information you're going to get from browsing the internet for free.  You can get access to certain types of research reports from Schwab and other discount brokerages, but it's not ""free"".  You've deposited money with and given order flow to these institutions, on which they in turn generate income.  But this is still relatively low value information compared to real, thorough equity research (it's often called ""Due Diligence"" here).  These reports cost money, and they're compiled by people with years of education and expertise, which in turn cost money.

So I'm sitting here next to a stack of just four books from my college years a quarter century ago:

1. Smith and Roberson's *Business Law.*
2. *Fundamentals of Financial Management* by Eugene F. Brigham.
3. *Management Accounting* by Anthony Atkinson &amp; Rajiv Banker (my professor).
4. *Security Analysis* by Dodd and Graham.

The fourth is by far the cheapest of them, because it's more widely used than in academia.  But together, these four books would today cost, in their hardcover editions, $1000... and that's just four introductory textbooks.  Nevermind the 4-5 years of school I had studying the soup-to-nuts of business management and, at the end of it, writing a thesis for a strategy formulation and implementation class that utilized all of the other learned disciplines in the development of a single, semester-long business case.

Very little of what analysts know in practice is something that can be distilled to the average investor without all of the years of underlying context.   Expecting you to digest this and beat the market would be like telling you to take a 5xxx or 7xxx level finance course and expecting you to place in the top 5% of the class, at a top 5% school.

So this is what really goes into business valuation exercises of any real worth.  Which is another way of saying: If you didn't pay for it, chances are it's not that valuable.

69,investing,XChrisUnknownX,Private company has been misleading about its capabilities.,"Hi. I'm a stenographer in New York. I run a blog devoted to my industry. I'd been following the Verbit company for some time. During its series A funding, it was talking about 99% accuracy in record time with its automatic speech recognition stuff. By its series B funding it was saying it would use human transcribers, because despite everyone's belief that automatic speech recognition can do what we do, there's actually some evidence from the racial disparities in automatic speech recognition study that's not true. 

So I know your subreddit appears to be geared toward public investing, but obviously, I see this as private equity throwing big money at what is likely to turn out to be a zombie company. You can draw a comparison with VIQ Solutions, which has not been profitable for as long as I've followed it. I'm wondering if any of you have involvement with those kinds of private funds, or how one would even get word to them that all is not as it seems.

There are also social and legal reasons I care about this, but I will mostly omit that here since it's more or less irrelevant to the topic of investing beyond the obvious point that they're trying to gain ground into a field that has a lot of competitors and in all likelihood the unicorn will become a money burn like Google's Deep Mind.

2. deposit it in a M1 Finance Plus brokerage account
3. take out 2x leverage at 2% margin rate. buying power is $3m now
4. put it all into HYG (iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF), yield is 4%, covid crash was 20% drawdown
5. collect $120k/yr in qualified dividends
6. owe about $10k in taxes (single filer, $12.2k standard deduction, first $40k in dividends is taxed at 0%)
7. owe about $30k/yr in margin interest
8. $80k/yr to spend

50,investing,stocksrcool,Question about Failure to Deliver (FTD) violation,"Yesterday I was trading in my margin account and using a hotkey to sell out of my position. I accidentally clicked the hotkey one more time than I should've, which caused me to open a naked short position. The software allowed this because it hadn't yet registered that I no longer had the shares. Within literally 3 seconds from going naked short, I bought back to cover. 

Today I got an email stating that my trading is restricted for 90 days because of the aforementioned. What I'm wondering is: How can it already be a violation, when the trade hasn't yet settled? From the SEC website:
&gt;In a “naked” short sale, the seller does not borrow or arrange to borrow the securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period.[3] As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due (known as a “failure to deliver” or “fail”) https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm

If I buy the same amount of shares today that I naked shorted yesterday, (using a different broker) can I use those shares to avoid the violation?

82,investing,nobjos,Is waiting for a dip the best investment strategy? - I analyzed last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!,"We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side and never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&amp;P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, let consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and for every subsequent year increased your investments by 5%. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

**Investment Returns : S&amp;P 500 (1993-2021)**

|**Scenario**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|
|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|
|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|
|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|
|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|

 

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f96f61-9b99-4d4a-b6cd-88eece3ecc1d_624x241.png)

 As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.     

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

48,investing,Thereian,DD: Atlas Air (AAWW) is laughably undervalued and has near term catalysts for a rapid revaluation,"*As always, do your own due diligence and invest responsibly. Author claims no responsibility for the accuracy of the facts and statements in this report. The investment (""YOLO"") below is a large but recoverable percent of my portfolio, in-line with my personal risk tolerance. Not intended as investment advice. I may modify (add, reduce, or even close out) my position at any time.*

**TL/DR:** AAWW is critically undervalued. COVID has all but annihilated international air travel volumes, driving up the price of air freight. Short term shipping disruptions have caused prices to soar, spilling over in to the air freight market. Analysts are expecting this disruption to resolve quickly, but are missing the shifts that airlines are making to narrow body jets and the impact on air freight. AAWW will have high earnings for years, and its current P/E of 4 is a joke. 13.6% of the float is shorted, and Atlas Air is free to reinitiate buybacks at the end of this month. AAWW's market cap could double and it still would trade at the rock bottom P/E of 8. Bullish AF.

\------

**Thesis**

Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.

**Background**

Atlas Air is an outsourced air services company that provides charter and other air services (""Airline Operations"") as well as leasing out their owned aircraft. Critically, the Airline Operations account for the vast majority of revenues (&gt;95%), and AAWW has a very, very heavy focus and exposure to air freight.

You may know that commercial flights also typically carry cargo. When COVID decimated international air travel, it left a few limited carriers to ship air freight internationally. Atlas Air filled that void and is making big money doing it.

**Short Term Prospects**

Beyond the COVID situation mentioned above, oceanliners have been backed up dramatically causing a squeeze in ocean freight prices. Normally, air freight costs very roughly 4-5x that of an oceanliner. But with surging rates from oceanliners, [air freight has now become competitive for many companies](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/a-perfect-storm-for-container-shipping/21804500) and it is spilling over in to a squeeze on air freight. [Here's another article joking about car tires flying first class.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/air-cargo-boom-has-car-tires-flying-first-class-11630242001) So we know that Atlas Air is going to have a pretty stellar third quarter. One for their corporate history books, to be sure. But how do they fare long-term?

**Long Term Prospects**

As a side note, I believe this is where the shorts are getting it very, very wrong. *I think* they are confident that while AAWW will have a great quarter, the freight rates will come back down again and AAWW will operate with only 'modest' profits like it did pre-COVID. What they are missing is a huge transformation in the airline industry from wide-body to narrow-body jets. Narrow-body jets carry far less cargo. Greenlight Capital did a fantastic job laying this out in it's July 26, 2021 investor letter (page 4, ""Air Freight""):

&gt;While there has been some recovery in passenger aviation, airlines are emphasizing narrow-body planes, which carry less freight than wide-body planes. Compared to 2019, current air freight demand is about 10% higher and capacity is about 10% lower. The result is that cargo rates have exploded.  
Supply will be slow to come on-line. Some passenger planes are being converted to freighters, but conversion capacity for wide-bodies is limited and the aggregate impact of this will be modest. Meanwhile, air freight companies trade at tiny multiples of what investors assume to be peak profits. The implied cost of equity is quite high, which makes it difficult to justify adding assets. As a result, air freight companies are in no rush to order new planes, and in any case, new orders would take several years to build. The result is rates and profits are likely to be higher than expected for quite some time.

**Short Interest**

For some reason I will never understand, at a P/E of 4 with incredible foreseeable cashflows, some people have decided to short 13.6% of the outstanding shares. To be clear, this is not GameStop. But it is a high short interest in a stock with earnings prospects surging by the day as freight rates increase. It certainly doesn't hurt. But the story gets even better...

**Upcoming Catalysts**

Okay, so perhaps you believe me that AAWW is critically undervalued, that they're going to make some amazing Q3/Q4 profits, and that their long term prospects are pretty fantastic too. What will drive this rapid revaluation in the coming months? The answer was subtly slipped in to the last earnings call (google ""AAWW Transcripts Q2 2021 Earnings Call""). Spencer Schwartz, the EVP and CFO answered a question and stated:

&gt;As far as the CARES Act restrictions, so the restrictions with regard to not being able to pay dividends or repurchasing shares, those expire at the end of September.

I simply cannot imagine that in this time of record earnings, AAWW will not return that value to shareholders. If they were to announce a share buyback once the CARES Act restrictions lap, we could see AAWW finally get to a reasonable share price. I truly believe this could double in the short-term.",1631829856,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ppn7u2/dd_atlas_air_aaww_is_laughably_undervalued_and/

My theory is that this way if I invest my 3 accounts in indexed sp500 funds, over the next 17 years I will come out with much better gains than I would doing say a 70/30 split...THEN once I turn 50 I can assess how the market looks, maybe pull back a bit from 50-55 and if things are going ok at 70/30 I can go all bonds there on out and know my money won't plummet and sleep tight at night...if the market takes a shit when I am 50 then I can just work a couple extra years and wait for things to get back on track then go all Bonds...

(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission awarded $110 million to a tipster whose information resulted in enforcement actions, bringing total payments under the agency’s whistle-blower program to more than $1 billion.

The tipster’s award, the second-largest ever, includes $40 million from the SEC and $70 million from a related action brought by another agency, according to a statement Wednesday. Under the SEC’s whistle-blower program, tipsters can be paid for information that prompts sanctions by another agency. 

“Today’s announcement underscores the important role that whistle-blowers play in helping the SEC detect, investigate and prosecute potential violations of the securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in the statement. “The assistance that whistle-blowers provide is crucial to the SEC’s ability to enforce the rules of the road for our capital markets.”

The SEC has made disbursements to 207 tipsters since issuing its first award in 2012. Individuals are eligible for payments ranging from 10% to 30% of the fines collected in enforcement cases where penalties exceed $1 million. Funds used to pay tipsters don’t come out of disgorgement, the portion of a sanction that’s supposed to be returned to harmed investors.

Neither the whistle-blowers nor the firms accused of misconduct were identified by the SEC, in keeping with the federal government’s policy of withholding information that could reveal a tipster’s identity.",1631789764,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ppb0hd/sec_gives_whistleblower_110_million_in_payout/

There's this statistic around that ~90% of investors underperform the market. A safe (-ish) and easy way of investing is therefore to just dump money into an index, especially for long term growth. 

The world economy is heavily linked to the US economy, which is best represented by the S&amp;P500 because this index is very general and has a lot of companies. The S&amp;P500 has grown a lot all through history, and there is never a point where the world economy grows yet the S&amp;P does not. So whenever there is something to gain, you will gain with just following S&amp;P.

Then, if you live in a non-US country you might want some exposure to your own country economy. Because that's where you will be earning and spending money in general. I live in Switzerland, which is a rich and stable country, so I can hold savings in the SMI index and they will follow Swiss economy.

21,investing,AristotleKarataev,Lesser-known stocks that supply popular industries,"We see a lot of hype around popular industries like genomics, semiconductors, or cars, and often these hyped-up stocks end up becoming scarily overvalued. 

Another way to invest in growing and hyped-up industries is to invest into companies that produce the supplies for these industries, rather than the big-names at the face of it. Not to mention, you're more likely to win if you invest in a supplier versus a small cap company looking to get in on the next big thing. In some industries, like electric cars, the hype has already consumed supply such as lithium battery stocks.

This discussion is primarily inspired by /u/Thereian's comment describing these kind of stock picks:

&gt;ENTG - Semiconduct manufacturing supplier. They supply all major players. Lots of battles going on in this industry but no matter who wins (Taiwan Semi, Intel, etc) they get paid. And all of the investment that Intel and Taiwan Semi are making to build billions of dollars worth of FABs? Yeah, Entegris will get their chunk of that money. They sell the equipment upfront and the consumables going forward. Truly a fantastic company, I've owned since 2009 and am still completely bullish.

&gt;TMO - Similar to the above philosophy. Lots of expensive cell and gene therapy companies out there, those are high risk. But there's a low-risk high-reward play: Thermo Fisher. Just like ENTG in the example above, Thermo is a supplier to the whole industry. While those biotechs remain unprofitable, the suppliers are getting paid and Thermo is making absolute bank in a rapid growth industry and yet it trades at a PE of 20...absurd. It'll double or triple in a couple years.

&gt;I'm an engineer focused on raw materials, so I'm a bit biased but I have seen suppliers make money hand over fist while the companies buying these things are burning cash or barely scraping by. Thats what drove me to look in to high-moat suppliers in the first place and I will continue to.

Do you agree with this investment philosophy? What are some other supplier stocks you hold or have looked into?",1631766870,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pp6gfl/lesserknown_stocks_that_supply_popular_industries/
25,investing,Cryptomoura,Theoretical question about the benefits of using Smartlands vs. traditional refinancing.,"
So, this is specifically for real estate. Generally, if you own your (residential, at least) property, you can get an equity based loan at the going rate to get some cash. I know Ukraine rates are higher than the US, but are they that much higher? Pretty sure you can do a home equity loan for like 6%, and I have to assume larger commercial loans are even lower. Plus they could do a full refinance for even lower rates in the 2-3% range. I don't see how tokenizing and effectively selling 40% of your building and forfeiting a percentage of future profits is a better deal than getting a loan from a bank for 40% of the building's value at a 2-6% interest rate... and getting to keep all the profits on top of that. Unless Ukraine interest rates are like 15-20% or something, seems like the bank is a better option. I'm probably just missing something, but my question is what is the draw to bring future properties in? Why would they choose this route over traditional finance?



I definitely get the SME side, but still trying to wrap my head around the benefits for real estate owners. Are they selling portions of the property they still owe money on? That seems quite risky. Maybe I am just not savvy enough on the costs associated with taking cash out of commercial properties. I'm quite excited about this project regardless for the SME side but any clarification on the real estate side would be appreciated.",1631764757,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pp5xta/theoretical_question_about_the_benefits_of_using/

What struck me as interesting is that the author cited and thanked Nick Szabo (creator of bitgold - precursor to bitcoin) for discussions on OpenPGP-based financial instruments.

Furthermore, in the footnotes, the author writes: ""A server program processing various financial instruments is described in detail in xxxx's thesis \[13\]. This piece of software will be the basis for the reference implementation of the protocols and data formats used for procedures described above.""

Ref: Schuller, J.: Designing and Implementing a System for Digital Cash, Master’s Thesis, University of Bremen (2007) .

The author identifies several key features for creating an optimal digital currency, namely, stressing digital currency should be anonymous, peer-to-peer, irreversible, etc.

I also found a link to a free/open-source, peer-to-peer digital cash/transaction software that the author created (lead founder) from 2002-2005/6 called ePoint (‘epointsystem.org’- the logo even looks kind of like Bitcoin), which abruptly stops development around 2006/2007,

In brief, the author:

-Was a highly trained cryptographer and coder (see Sourceforge link)

-Actively was developing a digital currency from 2002-2005/6, at which point the project stopped

-Had published an article in 2008 advocating for OpenPGP-based Instruments, and claims to be developing new digital cash technology based on OpenPGP principles in article

48,investing,p_giggles,What are some of your favorite duopolies?,"Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. 

My question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: 

$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. 

$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. 

Semiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves.

I'm guessing the flow is:

1. Have $1m-$10m in equities

2. Take an SBLOC of 50% of the value at 2%

3. Live your life (spend $400k-$1m/yr doing whatever it is rich people do)

4. Pay the interest back every year, keep receiving dividends, never sell any of your equities until it is time to have repaid the loan / you ran out of cash (say every 5 years), and since then your stocks have grown so you never really have less than the original number you started with equity wise

73,investing,cefpodoxime,New congressional draft legislation seeks to end tax efficiency of all ETFs,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/etf-industry-risks-losing-key-tax-edge-as-democrat-whets-knife

Amid the deluge of headlines in the past few days about congressional proposals to boost taxes on companies and the wealthy is one that would affect regular investors -- and potentially alter the entire U.S. fund landscape.

Draft legislation released by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon on Friday **featured a repeal of a key tax advantage for the $6.8 trillion U.S. exchange-traded fund industry.** The move was tucked in along with a series of proposals to tighten tax reporting requirements around business partnerships, and wasn’t highlighted in Wyden’s accompanying press release.

The initiative would at a stroke **end a system of deferred taxes on capital gains linked to ETFs, bringing forward the tax burden for investors of all stripes.** That will make it all the tougher to win inclusion in the final version of tax hikes that Democrats are now assembling to help pay for a social-spending package that’s been penciled in at $3.5 trillion.

“The industry will push back hard” at the proposal, said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “It’s hard for me to see this getting popular support -- in large part because it’s a benefit that is universal, so all investors, large, small and in-between, that are investing taxable money benefit from ETFs’ tax efficiency.”

The measure would bring in $205 billion over a decade, according to preliminary figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It would take effect in tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2022. Wyden said in a statement Tuesday that, “This proposal exempts retirement accounts entirely.”

Wyden’s proposal was made before his committee delivers its draft of tax measures for inclusion in the budget-reconciliation bill that will form the bulk of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda.

The effort would address an advantage for ETFs that stems from a law dating back to the Nixon administration. The law exempts so-called regulated investment companies, or RICs, from recognizing a taxable gain on assets if shareholders are paid out “in kind.” In other words, if withdrawing investors are paid in securities like stocks rather than in cash.

**ETFs are structured so that money flows in and out via facilitators known as authorized participants, and redemptions for a fund almost always take place in-kind. That means that if there are enough withdrawals, an ETF can avoid recognizing taxable gains entirely. Rather than paying a tax on a fund’s gains each year, investors usually don’t pay anything until they sell their ETF.**

“Because ETFs are pass-through vehicles, by definition every cent of the increased tax flows through directly to the shareholders -- not all of whom are filthy rich,” Jeremy I. Senderowicz at law firm Vedder Price said by email.

Some ETF managers use so-called heartbeat trades to increase the amount of withdrawals and erase all of a fund’s taxable gains. A friendly bank moves a pile of cash into a fund before almost immediately pulling it out, allowing the ETF to shed stocks that have gone up in value without incurring a taxable gain.

“This particular proposal simply applies the same rules already in place for corporations to regulated investment companies, so wealthy investors can no longer avoid all tax on their gains,” Wyden said in his statement Tuesday. “We’re only talking about the taxable accounts of the wealthiest investors.”

A summary of Wyden’s proposal mentions heartbeat transactions in particular, although he proposes to erase the entire provision that allows RICs to avoid recognizing gains. The proposal “would repeal the exception for RICs, aligning RICs with the general requirement that gain be recognized upon distribution by a corporation of built-in gain property,” the summary said.

That’s a potential industry game-changer. While ETFs tend to have several advantages over mutual funds -- like the ability to trade all day and generally lower fees -- research has shown the tax loophole is a key driver in the long-term trend of cash flowing from mutual funds into ETFs. As that has gathered pace, U.S. issuers are this year for the first time directly converting mutual fund assets into ETFs.

The final package of tax hikes, including ones on corporations and wealthy individuals, may takes weeks to develop.

“Wyden right now is coming up with his own provisions that could fit into that” final legislation, said Nathan Dean, a government analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Think of this as something to have in his hip pocket when the Democrats start negotiating.”

The odds may be against the ETF-related legislation ever passing, Dean said. First, because so much negotiation is still ahead, and second because it would directly impact ETFs, which are very popular with consumers. However, with so much currently up for discussion, it could slip through as a smaller provision not well-understood by lawmakers, he said. 

Senderowicz thinks the legislation has a low chance of succeeding because of the potential damage to many small investors -- but he also doesn’t rule it out.

“It’s impossible to disguise the incidence of the tax increase and thus lends itself well to political attacks,” said Senderowicz. “But if it’s a choice between it and the entire reconciliation bill coming apart?”",1631732907,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/powp8z/new_congressional_draft_legislation_seeks_to_end/

**However, there have been wild speculations as to how the contagion from Evergrande defaulting might affect the global markets. Could this be a Lehman Brothers v2.0?**

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Rating agency Fitch said that numerous sectors could be exposed to heightened credit risk if China’s No.2 property developer Evergrande Group were to default, although the overall impact on the banking sector would be manageable.

Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, as it teeters between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing.

Regulators have warned of broader risks to the country’s financial system if the company’s $305 billion of liabilities aren’t contained.

""We believe a default would reinforce credit polarisation among homebuilders and could result in headwinds for some smaller banks,"" Fitch said in a note bit.ly/3CbhKPt late on Tuesday.

Fitch downgraded China Evergrande Group to “CC” from “CCC+” on Sep. 7, indicating that it viewed a default of some kind as probable.

&gt;Regulators have warned of broader risks to the country's financial system if the company's $305 billion of liabilities aren't contained.

&gt;""We believe a default would reinforce credit polarisation among homebuilders and could result in headwinds for some smaller banks,"" Fitch said in a note late on Tuesday.

&gt;Fitch downgraded China Evergrande Group to ""CC"" from ""CCC+"" on Sep. 7, indicating that it viewed a default of some kind as probable.

&gt;On Tuesday, Evergrande said it has engaged advisers to examine its financial options and warned of cross-default risks amid plunging property sales and lack of progress in asset disposals. read more

&gt;Fitch said 572 billion yuan ($88.8 billion) of Evergrande's borrowings were held by banks and other financial institutions, but banks may also have indirect exposure to the developer's suppliers, who are owed 667 billion yuan for goods and services.

&gt;""Smaller banks with higher exposure to Evergrande or to other vulnerable developers could face significant increases in non-performing loans (NPLs), depending on how any credit event involving Evergrande develops,"" Fitch said.

&gt;But the agency added a recent People’s Bank of China sensitivity test showed the average capital adequacy ratio of the 4,000 banks in the country would only drop modestly if the NPL ratio for property-development loans were to rise by 15 basis points.

&gt;Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed stock slipped as much as another 5% to HK$2.82 on Wednesday morning, a fresh low since Jan 2014.

&gt;Its property management unit (6666.HK) and EV unit (0708.HK), however, bounced as much as 10.4% and 9.3%, respectively.

&gt;In the debt market, Evergrande's Shanghai traded July 2022 bond fell 5.6% to 28.3 yuan, while its dollar bond due March 2022 dropped 20% to 27.502 cents, yielding more than 500%.

&gt;Fitch also said the risk of significant pressure on house prices in the event of a default would be low, and it expected the government would act to protect households’ interests to ensure home deliveries.

&gt;On Wednesday, roughly 40 protesters stood near the entrance at Evergrande headquarters in Shenzhen, prevented from going inside by dozens of security personnel.

&gt;This followed chaotic scenes at the headquarters two days earlier, as disgruntled investors crowded its lobby to demand repayment of loans and financial products.

89,investing,ORCoast19,Thoughts on investing in energy &amp; inflation with OXY/WS?,"I’ve been buying OXY/WS this month, kicking myself for not buying them a year ago when I first learned of them. OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play are…

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Below’s a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego. For some reason, I don’t think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

The delisting of the Company’s ADSs has taken effect on 18 May 2021. In light of the delisting, the board of directors (the “Board”) of the Company resolved to terminate the ADSs program (the “ADS Program”) on 9 September 2021.

The Company’s H shares are traded on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. The Bank of New York Mellon expects to commence the sale of H shares of the Company represented by the remaining ADSs as soon as practicable after the Termination Date, and will pay the net cash proceeds, after deducting applicable fees and expenses, to the holders of such remaining ADSs.",1631642689,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/po83dy/advice_on_a_delisted_stoock_and_recent/

When it comes down to sizing the global online gambling market, “all bets are on.” Grand View Research says it will grow 11.5% to $127.3 billion in 2020-2027, while The Business Research Company predicts an increase of 10.4% to $92.8 million in 2019-2023. With these estimates, gambling stocks –including those of online casinos– are roaring up.

Online Gambling Growth

It was a tough last couple of years for brick-and-mortar casinos. The American Gaming Association reports that all commercial and tribal casino properties in the U.S. closed during Covid lockdowns, with tiers 1 and 6 operating between 24% and 50% capacity upon returning to operations. 

However, with this reactivation and the technological advances of online betting, the gambling industry is back with a bang and has become one of the fastest-growing businesses on the planet.

According to Insider Monkey, the online gambling market has reached 1.6 billion people, reigniting an industry that has seen a dramatic transformation through new technology. 

Play Today says that at least 80% of Americans gambled in the past year, as users rushed to online casino directories like Canada Casinos to crash the website, looking for some blazing betting fun.

During the pandemic, the business not only grew in size but also witnessed some eye-catching movements in online gambling stocks, with companies like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) soaring after its 2020 IPO.

Also, “MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) launched its mobile betting app BetMGM in partnership with Roar Digital, LLC,” Insider Monkey Reports.

Stocks On The Rise

This year, 12 states in the U.S. will legalize sports betting spreading the impact to online gambling platforms. With this outlook, the famous site Gambling.com going public under the “GAMB” ticker, with a price per share estimate of 8$ –although down from $11 to $13.

The company controls more than 30 websites in 13 countries, and hit nearly $28 million in revenue in 2020 and $11.5 million in the first quarter this year.

Another attractive stock option within the online gambling market is Penn National Gaming Inc (NASDAQ: PENN), which was mentioned in the second quarter investor letter of Baron Funds.

The letter said: “Following a 232% gain in 2020, the shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. declined 29% in the most recent quarter and are down 13% year-to-date. At its recent price of only $73 (down from a peak price of $136 in March), we believe Penn’s shares are now attractively valued.”

The casino firm is based in Pennsylvania boasting an $11.1 billion market capitalization. “PENN delivered a -17.98% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 32.73%. The stock closed at $70.84 per share on August 13, 2021.”

Brick-And-Mortar

Amid the economic comeback, brick-and-mortar casinos are also on the way up. According to Truist analyst Barry Jonas gave Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) a Hold rating “and increased its price target from $43 to $38.”

The vaccine rollout is likely to exert a positive effect on these stocks, coupled with the company’s solid earnings and optimistic forecast.

Insider Monkey reports that “In the first quarter of 2021, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) had an EPS of $0.68, short on estimates of $0.85. The company’s net revenue decreased 15.6% or $1.20 billion from the previous quarter.”

As for Caesars Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:CZR), the casino leader saw a solid EPS of $2.03 in the first quarter, up from $1.80. Its revenue during the same period hit $1.7 billion, an increase of 259.2% versus the last year. “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has gained 131% in the past 12 months and 27% year to date.”

31,investing,infuriatedworshipwa,"HighGold Mining Intersects 20 g/t AuEq over 4.3m in 100m Step-out at JT Deposit, Alaska"," 

**HighGold Mining Inc. (TSX-V:HIGH, OTCQX:HGGOF)** (“**HighGold**” or the “**Compan**y”) is pleased to announce assay results for the first drill hole of the 2021 Field Season from expansion drilling at its flagship 0.75 million ounce 10.9 g/t gold equivalent (“AuEq”) Johnson Tract polymetallic Gold Project (“Johnson Tract”, “JT” or the “Project”) in Southcentral Alaska, USA.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005396/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005396/en/)

 

Drillhole JT21-123 was designed to test along strike and down-plunge from the **JT Deposit** as a nominal 100-meter step-out from last years expansion drilling on the northeast side of the deposit (**Figure 1**). High-grade mineralization was successfully intersected in hole JT21-123, building on the success of the 2020 drill program and extending the total strike length to 600 meters.

**Drill Highlights – JT Deposit Expansion (JT21-123)**

* **13.1 g/t Au, 200 g/t Ag, 4.92% Zn, 2.04% Pb, and 0.35% Cu (20 g/t AuEq) over 4.3m including**
   * **19.0 g/t Au, 242 g/t Ag, 7.10% Zn, 2.91% Pb, and 0.50% Cu (28 g/t AuEq) over 2.8m**

“This is a great start to the 2021 drill program,” commented President and CEO Darwin Green. “Our first drill hole of the season has intersected strong precious and base metal mineralization in a large step-out from last years drilling, expanding the total strike length of JT Deposit mineralization by 15-20% to 600 meters. In addition to the excellent gold grades, the intersection includes some of the highest silver grades documented to date at the JT Deposit and is developed within a mudstone host – features often found in gold-rich VMS deposits. We are already designing follow-up holes and are excited to see how this new variation in the mineralization style at the JT Deposit develops as we continue to test at depth and along strike.” 

**Discussion of Current JT Deposit Expansion Results**

Assay results reported today include an intersection from expansion drilling at the JT Deposit from hole JT21-123 – the first drill hole completed from the 20,000-meter Johnson Tract drill program. The mineralization encountered in hole JT21-123 is hosted within a fine-grained mudstone unit (379.7 to 384.0 meters) and is similar to the ‘**VMS style**’ mineralization reported last season in hole JT20-114 (**7.8 meters at 9.8% ZnEq**) located 600 meters northeast of the JT Deposit (*See Company press release dated April 3, 2021*). The mineralization in hole JT21-123 is characterized by fine-grained disseminated sphalerite-galena-chalcopyrite-pyrite within a mudstone stratigraphically overlying strong anyhydrite-altered dacite lapilli tuff, which is characteristic of the main JT Deposit. This development continues to highlight the overall exploration potential for the Project.

Location of the step-out hole in relation to the JT Deposit is presented on a longitudinal section in **Figure 1**. The Au-Cu-Zn-Ag-Pb mineralization associated with the JT Deposit has now been defined over a total strike length of 600 meters and remains open along strike to the northeast and southwest, and at depth.

AuEq is calculated using nominal current spot metal prices of $1780/oz gold, $24/oz silver, $4.25/lb copper, $1.35/lb zinc, $1.05/lb lead and assumed recovery of 90% for all metals. True thickness for the intersection in hole JT21-123 is not well established, with a best estimate of 70% to 80% of drilled width.

**Current Initiatives and 2021 Program Update**

Three diamond drill rigs are currently operating on the Project in conjunction with a regional geological mapping and geochemical sampling program, ground-based induced polarization (“DCIP”) geophysical surveying, and a Phase I metallurgical sampling program. Assays results will be released on an ongoing basis pending review and meeting Company quality assurance-quality control protocols. An updated mineral resource estimate is planned for the JT Deposit in early 2022, following the completion and receipt of all assays from the 2021 drill program. The new resource estimate will incorporate new drilling completed in 2020 and 2021.

Over 10,000 meters of a planned 20,000 meters have been drilled to date. This includes 11 holes at JT Deposit area targets, and 15 holes at DC Prospect targets, one of several regional prospects that define a 12-km long mineralized trend at Johnson Tract. The JT Deposit expansion program includes 100-meter nominal step-outs from the known extent of mineralization along strike to the northeast and southwest, down plunge, and within the recently defined Footwall Copper Zone. For additional detail on 2021 drill targets please see Company press release dated June 23, 2021. DCIP geophysical surveying, designed to detect sulphide mineralization, is ongoing and has to date completed approximately 28-line kilometers of a planned 40-line km survey. Drilling at Johnson Tract is scheduled to continue through the end of October. Ability to complete the full 20,000 meters this season is contingent on weather and drilling conditions. Upon completion of the Johnson Tract program, drilling is expected to commence at HighGold’s Ontario gold projects.

**About the Johnson Tract Gold Project**

Johnson Tract is a poly-metallic (gold, copper, zinc, silver, lead) project located near tidewater, 125 miles (200 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, USA. The 21,000-acre district scale property includes the high-grade Johnson Tract Deposit (“JT Deposit”) and at least nine (9) other mineral prospects over a 12-kilometer strike length. HighGold acquired the Project through a lease agreement with Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (“CIRI”), one of 12 land-based Alaska Native regional corporations created by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. CIRI is owned by more than 9,100 shareholders who are primarily of Alaska Native descent.

Mineralization at Johnson Tract occurs in Jurassic-age intermediate volcaniclastic rocks and is characterized as epithermal-type with submarine volcanogenic attributes. The JT Deposit is a thick, steeply dipping silicified body (20m to 50m average true thickness) that contains a stockwork of quartz-sulphide veinlets and brecciation, cutting through and surrounded by a widespread zone of anhydrite alteration. The Footwall Copper Zone is located structurally and stratigraphically below JT Deposit and is characterized by copper-silver rich mineralization. The Au-Cu-Zn-Ag-Pb mineralization associated with the JT Deposit has now been defined over a total strike length of 600 meters and to a depth of 350 meters and remains open along strike to the northeast and southwest, and at depth.

The JT Deposit hosts an Indicated Resource of 2.14 Mt grading 10.93 g/t gold equivalent (“AuEq”) comprised of 6.07 g/t Au, 5.8 g/t Ag, 0.57% Cu, 0.80% Pb and 5.85% Zn. The Inferred Resource of 0.58 Mt grading 7.16 g/t AuEq is comprised of 2.05 g/t Au, 8.7 g/t Ag, 0.54% Cu, 0.33% Pb, and 6.67% Zn. For additional details see NI 43-101 Technical Report titled “*Updated Technical Report for the Johnson Tract Project, Alaska*” is dated August 9, authored by Ray C. Brown, CPG, and James N. Gray, P.Geo. Gold Equivalent is based on assumed metal prices and 90% recovery for Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Assumed metal prices for the Resource are US$1350/oz for gold (Au), US$16/oz for silver (Ag), US$2.80/lb for copper (Cu), US$1.00/lb for lead (Pb), and US$1.20/lb for zinc (Zn) and are based on nominal 3-year trailing averages as of April 1, 2020. Historical metallurgical testing on drill core samples has indicated that good gold and base metal recoveries and marketable concentrates can be expected.

Prior to HighGold, the Project was last explored in the mid-1990s by a mid-tier mining company that evaluated direct shipping material from Johnson to the Premier Mill near Stewart, British Columbia.

**Additional notes:**

The starting azimuth and dip (Azimuth/-Dip) for drillhole JT21-123 is 130/-62. Samples of drill core were cut by a diamond blade rock saw, with half of the cut core placed in individual sealed polyurethane bags and half placed back in the original core box for permanent storage. Sample lengths typically vary from a minimum 0.5 meter interval to a maximum 2.0 meter interval, with an average 1.0 to 1.5 meter sample length. Drill core samples are shipped by air and transport truck in sealed woven plastic bags to ALS Minerals sample preparation facility in Reno, Nevada for sample preparation and analysis. ALS Minerals operate according to the guidelines set out in ISO/IEC Guide 25. Gold is determined by fire-assay fusion of a 50 g sub-sample with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Samples that return values &gt;10 ppm gold from fire assay and AAS are determined by using fire assay and a gravimetric finish. Various metals including silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc are analyzed by inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy, following multi-acid digestion. The elements copper, lead and zinc are determined by ore grade assay for samples that return values &gt;10,000 ppm by ICP analysis. Silver is determined by ore grade assay for samples that return &gt;100 ppm.

The Company has a robust QAQC program that includes the insertion of blanks, standards and duplicates.

33,investing,RelativeSquare0,Is This the Right Time to Invest in Casino Stocks?," 

For some, 2020 was the worst year to be a casino investor. For others, it was the best year in a decade. The explanation is rather straightforward. Brick and Mortar casinos suffered heavy financial losses due to the coronavirus pandemic.

If you owned stocks for Wynn Resorts, the Bellagio, and Las Vegas Sands, you had to cut your losses or hold onto your stocks despite their declining values. On the flip side, online casino shareholders recorded increased profits because the industry was not impacted by COVID.

## Buying Casino Stocks in 2021

While 2020 had mixed results for casino investors, 2021 is proving to be a better year for both types of investors. The fact that Macau casinos lost 79% of their stock values last year means they hold immense growth potential this year.

In the US, Las Vegas and Atlantic City casinos performed better than their Macau counterparts. No, they didn’t make higher profits compared to 2021. In fact, they suffered losses for half of 2021.

During the six months US casinos were up and running, though, they generated enough revenues to stay afloat. In 2021, these businesses have been in a recovery mode. Once in a while, they’re ordered to shut down or reduce capacity.

But generally speaking, most of these businesses have been open throughout 2021.Mobile gambling businesses, on the other hand, picked from where they left last year. From leading American brands like Penn National Gaming and DraftKings to 888 Sports and Paddy Power—online casino stocks are on an upward curve.

In fact, some land-based casinos—Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts—have already expressed their interest in buying online gambling stocks. Which stocks will they buy? No one knows.

[Go to this page](https://www.bestcasinosites.net/canada/) for an overview of the top online casinos in Canada. Check out how they work, their games, terms, bonuses, and payment options. If convinced, you could even play a few games. And if you’re more of an investor, you can buy shares from the best-performing brands.

## 5 Best Casino Stocks to Check out

Investors with high-risk appetites began bulking up gambling stocks last year. But if you’re yet to make a purchase, below is a list of five stocks to check out:

### 1. Flutter Entertainment (OTC: PDYPF)

At a price tag of $200 per share, Flutter Entertainment is a fairly expensive stock. However, it also holds incredible growth potential. Here’s why. This Irish company owns some of the biggest online gambling companies in the world:

* FanDuel
* Paddy Power
* Bet Fair
* PokerStars (The Stars Group)

FanDuel, which added 900,000 new players last year, generated 91% of the company’s US revenue in 2020. FanDuel dominates 36% of the American sports betting industry, estimated to be worth over $5 billion.

Much of Flutter’s growth potential comes from the US. And that’s not just because of FanDuel. Online gambling is increasingly becoming legal in the US. This will lead to more sales and a growing stock value for OTC: PDYPF.

DraftKings’ is FanDuel’s biggest competitor in the US. As such, the growth of FanDuel also means DraftKings is doing pretty well. Indeed, DraftKings prides in dominating 25% of the US online sport betting market share.

Some experts doubt DraftKings will live up to its potential now that brick and mortar casinos are back in operation. But there’s a high chance it will prove these critics wrong. Although Land-based casinos have a huge audience, growing statistics show more Americans are choosing mobile over in-person sports betting.

In New Jersey, for example, 80% of the $5B betting handle recorded in 2019 came from mobile bettors. This is the case for Pennsylvania, DC and a few more states. People are adopting mobile betting in droves, which could improve DraftKings’ stock price from the current $60 to $100 or more.

### 2. DraftKings

If you’re looking for an untapped company with tremendous growth opportunities, think about Esports Entertainment Group. Based on its stock price alone, Malta-based Esports Entertainment is headed for better days.

At the start of last year, this company’s stock was valued at roughly $4. Then it shot up to $17 by March this year. It has since corrected to $8 but this isn’t to say it’s on a free fall. Esports is a new industry that just hit the $1B valuation a couple of years ago.

This year, experts predict the industry will grow by 15%. In terms of adoption, eSports could welcome up to 729M millions by early next year. The growth will be fueled by corporate sponsorships and live-streaming capabilities.

All the same, what this growth means is that eSports betting websites like EEG could grow in the long term as well. Beware, though, loads of betting websites are embracing eSports betting. As such, EEG’s market share will reduce over time.

### 3. Esports Entertainment Group

If you’re looking for an untapped company with tremendous growth opportunities, think about Esports Entertainment Group. Based on its stock price alone, Malta-based Esports Entertainment is headed for better days.

At the start of last year, this company’s stock was valued at roughly $4. Then it shot up to $17 by March this year. It has since corrected to $8 but this isn’t to say it’s on a free fall. Esports is a new industry that just hit the $1B valuation a couple of years ago.

This year, experts predict the [industry will grow by 15%](https://influencermarketinghub.com/esports-stats/). In terms of adoption, eSports could welcome up to 729M millions by early next year. The growth will be fueled by corporate sponsorships and live-streaming capabilities.

### 4. Gamesys Group

Gamesys is one of the biggest gambling brands in the UK. Last year, its stock price plummeted after its brick-and-mortar casinos were shut down. But it managed to recover significantly toward the end of the year mainly due to the solid performance of its online brands.

Considering the gambling industry is projected to climb in the next five years, Gamesys can be a safe bet. It’s a high-cap brand. And as a result, there’s a high chance its stock will climb. However, it’s an expensive stock and it might not surge as much as its smaller competitors.

### 5. MGM Resorts

If you would love to own a part of Las Vegas, consider investing in one of the biggest brands in the desert: MGM Resorts. This company is always looking for investment opportunities, which is how it became the largest casino in Vegas.

Unlike some of its competitors, MGM Resorts owns an online casino. In fact, it’s constantly acquiring licenses in every state legalizing online gambling. Last year, MGM also made brave decisions by selling a significant chunk of its real estate holdings to focus on casino operations. That said, the brand’s track record and overall stocks growth show it’s a great buy for long-term speculation.

Press release:  https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm

&gt;The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.3 percent in
August on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.5 percent in July, the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items
index increased 5.3 percent before seasonal adjustment.

&gt;The indexes for gasoline, household furnishings and operations, food, and shelter
all rose in August and contributed to the monthly all items seasonally adjusted
increase. The energy index increased 2.0 percent, mainly due to a 2.8-percent
increase in the gasoline index. The index for food rose 0.4 percent, with the
indexes for food at home and food away from home both increasing 0.4 percent. 

&gt;The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.1 percent in August, its
smallest increase since February 2021. Along with the indexes for household
operations and shelter, the indexes for new vehicles, recreation, and medical care
also rose in August. The indexes for airline fares, used cars and trucks, and
motor vehicle insurance all declined over the month.  

&gt;The all items index rose 5.3 percent for the 12 months ending August, a smaller
increase than the 5.4-percent rise for the period ending July. The index for all
items less food and energy rose 4.0 percent over the last 12 months, also a
smaller increase than the period ending July. The energy index rose 25.0 percent

45,investing,MiracleMagnet,5 gold tips for forex investments,"**Understand and constantly remind yourself that** ***emotions*** **should** ***never*** **be brought to the trading table ever!** This is one of the key rules when trading. This has been emphasised by many top traders and professional finance managers. Many fail in the forex industry because they get emotionally attached to their trades. When you bring emotions to the table, you are not making informed decisions based on facts and logic, so this increases the likelihood of losing the trade. Learn to leave your emotions at the door (so to speak); so this means not getting angry, shocked, upset, overexcited and not falling in love with any charts or currency pairs. Even though you may have favourite pairs that you enjoy trading, try your best not to get attached as they can break your heart ‘in a heartbeat’ - if you’re not careful.

**A habit that was very helpful - making** ***prediction trades*** **or paper trades (not real trades).** Helps with your mind frame on the industry because the more you do this the better you get, the more you learn and the more confident you are. When a person is confident, good things usually happen to them and in this case your trading improves and that equates to more success.

**When starting out, it’s crucial to understand that the money will not come straight away but it will eventually.** It’s easy to get carried away because of the excitement of starting this new forex journey and wanting to be profitable right away - it cannot work like that - you have to start slow and steady. One way this was achieved was to *prove* to myself that I could gain *pips* and percentages - not the money. Understanding that pips make the money, you’ll also know that if you can consistently accumulate the pips then the money will follow. Do not get greedy; learn your craft before you focus on the money.

**One important habit in forex and life in general is exercising** ***self-control*** **and having** ***patience.*** These are key factors and major characteristics that are needed to be a great trader - it’s like waiting for a bus; another setup will come in five minutes (well probably longer but you get the drift). Sitting on our hands a lot of the time is part of package.

**Do** ***tests*** **and exercises to stimulate the brain every now and then.** This is a great tactic to put you in the frame of mind of knowing that this is serious and that you need to revise, research and train for forex. An example of a test would be to set yourself 10 questions to answer weekly, almost like an exam when you were in college. This will help keep the mind fresh on key aspects of the industry.

Obviously I'm earning 0 interest and so am looking at putting this in to an index fund that tracks the S&amp;P500 instead. I'm confused however about how I actually go about doing this and have some questions. 

I downloaded Plus500 and played with the demo account to see if I could get my head around it.

1) Is the US500 (Indeces) the same as the S&amp;P500. If not, what's the difference? There is no S&amp;P500 listed on the app in my locality. 
2) I'm confused by the leverage. I don't want to leverage anything. I want the money I invest to be invested, not more which would open me up to potential losses over my assets (although unlikely obviously in an index fund). However, when I go to buy in the demo, the only option is to leverage at 1:20. I can't just say ""Ok, put 150 in to this"" for example). 

These things lead me to believe that I've been looking in the wrong place. Looking at this link it appears that the things I'm looking at on PLUS500 are no index funds

58,investing,Siixteentons,"If you make less than $110k and are married, you should be taking long term capital gains every year from your taxable accounts, I think?","After looking at tax brackets for long term capital gains, I believe that married couples with income of less than $110k should be capturing their gains every year until they hit $110k total income. 

For married filing jointly with a taxable income of less than $80k, the tax on long term capital gains is 0%. With the standard deduction of $24k, that means your income can be up to $104k before your would start paying taxes on long term capital gains. Add in some above the line deductions like HSA contributions, traditional 401k contributions, health insurance premiums, student loan interest, and any tuition and you can easily exceed the $110k income number that I used earlier. 

If your income is less than that amount you could sell your holdings until your realized gains reach that limit  and you would pay 0% tax on them. You could immediately rebuy them at a new cost basis and continually do this year after year until your income exceeds the limit. then when you finally sell, you would be using a much higher cost basis than if you held through all those years. 

Obviously you could do this if you were single as well, but all the amounts would be halved due to the lower tax thresholds.

Is anyone out there doing this? Is there something I'm missing?

77,investing,Your_Mom1111,How would I become a private investor?,"I am 18 years old and a sophomore in college (in the USA). I am a business major, as business/investing has been pretty much a passion for me since I discovered it. I love the field and enjoy it. 

I started getting into stocks when I was 16. I also did an internship at a company that summer and was able to “shadow” the owner to see what running a company is like. Learned a lot and it was interesting even though it was only a month there. Wish it could be longer, it was a different country too. 

After a year of investing and researching the stock market every single day, I decided to make the big jump and start an e-commerce store. I was still under 18 and had to use my parents behalf to start it. It was a big jump. The website and products were great, but the only issue was that I didn’t know how to drive traffic and customers that were going to make a purchase. I didn’t know how to market my products. And just because a business is visually good it doesn’t mean that the business can perform well. Starting my own business was great, I learned more in those 2 months (I know its short) than I did in my freshman year of college. 

This was the only issue, however I did learn how important every part of a business is., and how one bad part of a business can cause it to fail. I also had to learn some basic marketing stuff on my free time. 

So for the next year and a half I started to get involved in any sort of investing I can do at my age. 
Ive created business models/ideas as well on the side to safe as future reference.

Ive noticed my strengths in the business field, and I think being a private investor might be a good option in the future. Heck, I love all types of investing in general lol. Maybe I could start investing in different industries privately. 

How would I start being a private investor (starting small of course. More in startups, different industries etc)? Is this something I can right out of college or even before if I have enough capital?

99,investing,respectfulskeptic,"House Democrats propose new retirement plan rules for the rich, including contribution limits and a repeal of Roth conversions","
   House Democrats proposed several changes to retirement accounts as part of a push to make the tax code more equitable and raise money for their $3.5 trillion budget plan.
    Among them, the reforms would end “backdoor” and “mega-backdoor” Roth strategies for the wealthy and add new rules for individuals with retirement savings over $10 million.
    The legislation would also disallow IRA investments that require owners to be accredited investors.


House Democrats proposed a slew of changes to retirement accounts for the rich on Monday, part of a restructuring of the tax code tied to a $3.5 trillion budget plan.

Taken together, Democrats’ reforms aim to erode the use of retirement accounts as a perceived tax shelter for the wealthy and instead promote them as a way for low- and middle-income Americans to build a nest egg.

Most of the changes would start in 2022.

Wealthy individuals with retirement accounts exceeding $10 million would be prohibited from contributing extra savings and would have a new required minimum distribution each year, according to an outline of tax legislation unveiled Monday by the House Ways and Means Committee.

House Democrats propose corporate tax rate of 26.5%

The bill would also repeal so-called Roth conversions in individual retirement accounts and 401(k)-type plans for those making more than $400,000 a year. It would also prevent savers from using the “mega-backdoor Roth” strategy, regardless of income level.

Further, the legislation would prohibit individual retirement accounts from holding investments that require buyers to be accredited investors, a status generally reserved for wealthy investors.

The proposals are part of a broader theme of raising taxes on those who earn more than $400,000 a year to help pay for education, climate, paid-leave, child-care and other measures while also making the tax code more equitable.

They also follow Democrats’ outcry following a recent ProPublica report that Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder, owns a Roth IRA that had grown to $5 billion in 2019, up from less than $2,000 in 1999.

“IRAs were designed to provide retirement security to middle-class families, not allow the super wealthy to avoid paying taxes,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said in July after a data release showing growth of “mega” IRAs.

Democrats have narrow margins within which to pass a bill, which they aim to do with a simple majority via a budget reconciliation maneuver.

Republicans remain staunchly opposed. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, framed the spending as the “greatest expansion of the welfare state in our lifetimes” during a Thursday hearing, saying that it “wastes hard-earned tax dollars.”
Contribution limits

Current law lets taxpayers make IRA contributions regardless of account size.

However, the legislation would prohibit individuals from making more contributions to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA if the total value of their combined IRA and defined-contribution plan exceeds $10 million. A defined-contribution plan is a 401(k) plan or other similar workplace savings plan.

The policy’s purpose would be “to avoid subsidizing retirement savings once account balances reach very high levels,” according to a proposal outline.

That limit would apply to single taxpayers with more than $400,000 of taxable income. The threshold would be $450,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $425,000 for heads of household.
RMDs for ‘mega’ IRAs

Individuals whose combined traditional IRA, Roth IRA and defined-contribution retirement accounts exceed $10 million at year’s end would have to withdraw at least 50% of the excess the following year.

Those with account totals exceeding $20 million must pull from Roth IRAs and 401(k) plans first.

These new required minimum distributions for mega IRAs would only be required for savers whose taxable income exceeds the same thresholds identified above for the contribution limits.
Backdoor Roth

There are income limits to contribute to Roth IRAs. In 2021, single taxpayers can’t add money to such accounts if their income exceeds $140,000.

But current law allows for “backdoor” contributions to Roth IRAs. That can be achieved by converting a traditional IRA or Roth 401(k) account, which don’t carry income limits. There are income limits that determine whether contributions to traditional IRAs are tax-deductible or not.

Savers pay tax on the conversions, but their future investment growth and retirement distributions are tax-free.

The legislation would end the backdoor Roth IRA strategy by eliminating Roth conversions for both IRAs and workplace plans such as 401(k) plans.

The policy would apply at the same income thresholds listed above. It would count for distributions, transfers and contributions made in taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2031.
Mega backdoor Roth

The so-called “mega-backdoor Roth” strategy uses a principle similar to that of the backdoor Roth.

The strategy lets high earners save up to $58,000 in a 401(k) plan — more than the traditional $19,500 contribution limit — using a type of after-tax 401(k) bucket. Savers then convert that savings to a Roth account, once again yielding the benefit of tax-free investment growth.

Democrats’ legislation would end the mega-backdoor Roth by prohibiting all after-tax contributions in workplace plans and prohibiting after-tax IRA contributions from being converted to a Roth account.

This policy would apply for everyone, regardless of income level.
Accredited investors

Democrats’ legislation would disallow IRA investments that require the owner to have a minimum level of assets or income, or to have completed a minimum level of education or obtained a specific license or credential.

This would apply, for example, to accredited investors seeking to buy a private investment.

IRAs with these investments would lose their IRA status — meaning they’d lose their tax benefits.

These rules would apply starting in 2022, but there’d be a two-year transition period for IRAs already holding these investments.",1631571383,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pnpr7h/house_democrats_propose_new_retirement_plan_rules/

83,investing,GadnukBreakerOfWrlds,Beijing to break up Ant’s Alipay and force creation of separate loans app,"**Seems like BABA can't catch a break. The Ant valuation has dropped a lot ever since its IPO was scuttled last November. BABA has been in a downtrend since then and looks like there will be more selling this week. The bottom will be found only when the regulatory pressures on all its businesses (e-commerce, finance, cloud, etc) ease up**

Beijing wants to break up Alipay, the 1bn plus-user superapp owned by Jack Ma’s Ant Group, and create a separate app for the company’s highly profitable loans business, in the most visible restructuring yet of the fintech giant.

Chinese regulators have already ordered Ant to separate the back end of its two lending businesses, Huabei, which is similar to a traditional credit card, and Jiebei, which makes small unsecured loans, from the rest of its financial offerings and bring in outside shareholders. Now officials want the two businesses to be split into an independent app as well.

The plan will also see Ant turn over the user data that underpins its lending decisions to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned, according to two people familiar with the process.

“The government believes big tech’s monopoly power comes from their control of data,” said one person close to financial regulators in Beijing. “It wants to end that.”

The move may slow down Ant’s lending business, with the enormous growth of Huabei and Jiebei partly powering its planned IPO last year. The CreditTech unit, which includes the two units, overtook Ant’s main payment processing business for the first time in the first half of 2020, to account for 39 per cent of the group’s revenues.

The judge didn’t rule that Apples 30% commission is illegal. She also didn’t tie the 30% commission to payment method. So Devs still can’t dodge the 30% commission even if they use an alternate payment system.

Yes, it will be harder for Apple to collect the fee. But most Devs won’t bother since they would have to pay Apple 30% PLUS the credit card processor an additional 3-4%.

1. Just bouncing of its 52 week low.

2. Last 3 days RGS saw the highest trading volume in its history (normally trades under 150K last 3 days over 3 Mln per day) 

3. CALL/PUT ratio has swelled (91% Calls 9% Puts with huge volume for a stock like RGS) 

4. Short interest is over 25% in a very tight float.  

5. Leadership; New CEO &amp; 2 New Board members added recently. 

6. Activist investors also taking long positions.  

7. The Oct. $10 Call was recorded as one of the contracts with the highest IV in the market this past week.  

In conclusion can’t see it dropping much further and the chart is also showing the last segment of a wedge meaning it’s about to make a big move in either direction and I’m betting upwards. Last time the price fell this much it bounced over 100% to the upside within less than one month.  It’s all there check it out.  I’m personally deep in March Calls.

Comes in Ventripoint Diagnostics. $VPT is a commercial medical imaging company that enables fast and simple screening of cardiac diseases through its VMS+ 3.0 system. VMS+ 3.0 is a hardware/software system compatible with any echocardiogram that transforms 2D and 3D ultrasound images into MRI-equivalent full 3D models of the heart. 

VPT recently announced their joint venture with General Electric Healthcare to place their software on GE's ultrasound machines. Just capturing 1% of this specific market is $2,000,000,000 in sales.

To sum up, there are many positive catalysts for Ventripoint. Firstly, any investment in the company is substantially de-risked given that the product is already developed with regulatory approvals and sales are already underway.

Its current valuation of USD$50 million is also small change for large players and this may result in an attractive exit strategy if an acquisition goes through.

Compare Ventripoint against its peers - the Nasdaq-listed Nano X- Imaging Ltd. (NNOX) with a market cap of US$1.57 Billion. https://www.smallcapasia.com/5-things-to-like-about-ventripoint/ The potential is huge!

If I buy bonds I want a high yield, right? Yield is the return I’m getting on that bond. So if I buy a $10,000 bond with a coupon rate of 10%, yearly coupon is $1,000 interest income. But I also want to buy this $10,000 bond for a discounted price. Let’s say $6,000 discount bond price.  So my yield is ($1000/$6,000) = .1666666. 

If I bought the bond at a premium, let’s say $10,300. My yield is lower. ($1000/$10300) = .097

So if interest rates are expected to rise due to inflation, bond prices are going to drop? Thus bond yields will go up?

And if interest rates go down, bond prices rise, and yields decrease?

50,investing,TwatBrah,Carl Zeiss as exposure to investments in semiconductor production,"As we know the demand for semiconductors is only set to grow over the long-term. Additionally supply constraints and geopolitics has prompted new fab construction in Europe and the US. The shortage of chips for the European cars industry coupled with the fact that EV's leverage computing power far more than combustion has really lit the fire under EU governments. This coincides with the deployment of the 750 billion euro recovery fund a lot of which is earmarked for investment in ""digitization"" and technology as well as the explicit goal of EU govts to increase domestic chip production. Certainly there is a fairly unique confluence of positive factors for the chip industry in Europe. 

ASML (the worlds most advanced supplier of industrial equipment for chipmaking) has grown in value for some time now and I wonder if a lot of said factors are priced in. Its subcontractor Carl Zeiss which is among the world leaders in optics technology has also seen its stock value increase but not by as much despite being crucial for advanced litography and frankly, in my estimation, far ahead of the competition.

I'm thinking about the potential upside but what keeps me back is the fact that: 1 despite being high-value-added there is only so much potential demand for advanced optics, lasers and such and 2 the highly specialized engineering cannot be scaled up in the same way, say car or battery production can. Still I think it's a safe medium and long-term bet but the oppertunity cost of putting money in Zeiss compared to obvious growth industries like battery is unclear.

57,investing,embrace-ur-elements,Forward PE Estimate for SP500 will fall short over next 10 years,"Hi everyone. I want to make a simple point and have a debate about the SP500 valuation.  Basically, the big question we all have to ask ourselves is what is the longterm annualized return on the SP500 if we invest at these levels? I have seen people calculate this based on the current forward PE estimate and I believe this is highly dangerous!

Here is the common argument I see on here:

SP500 forward PE is at 22. Therefore we have a 4.5% earnings yield. Then given historical real earnings growth of the SP500 of 2%, we should see a 6.5% real return if investing at these levels. This isn't bad comparing to negative real yield offered by TIPs. And a measily nominal yield of 1.34% nominal yield of the 10yr. Therefore SP500 is fairly attractive. 

However, I don't think we should be assuming the real earnings implied by the forward PE is a reasonable starting place for this calculation. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is what we see in the next couple of years, but can we really assume this will last? Current forward PE of 22 on SP500 at 4500 means we expect to see 205 in real earnings which I will argue cannot last outside of the next few years.

Instead here are what I believe to be more accurate depiction of what the true earnings will be going forward on a real, averaged level. This will determine forward annualized returns.

**Estimate 1: 2019 real earnings is 140.  (Also max real earnings of SP500 is 140).**

This isn't the most reliable estimate but it is telling. The reason that it is telling is that it is the pre-covid earnings of the SP500 and recent. Not only that but it is also the all time high real earnings for the SP500 and occurs after a period of recovery fueled by extreme debt. Now of course 2019 is backward looking so if we account using a 2% real earnings growth rate, then we get to 148 in SP500 real earnings going forward.

**Estimate 2: CAPE Ratio is 40 implying 112.5 in real earnings for 10 year average. Adjusting for earnings growth the ratio is 36.5 implying 120 in real earnings.**

Now CAPE ratio, as it is the PE ratio with E being the average of the last 10 years of inflation adjusted earnings, is somewhat backward looking. Although it does account for inflation it does not account for natural growth in earnings. If we take the historical geometric mean of 2% annualized real earnings growth and adjust CAPE for this, then the CAPE ratio is 36.5 or about 120 in real earnings. This better reflects what earnings are likely to be going forward. Personally I believe this estimate to be the most fair measurement.

**Forward PE predicts 205 in real earnings for SP500.**

This tells me one should not use the forward PE for SP500 to forecast the earnings of the SP500 for the next decade as it would be 50% above all time high earnings that occurred in 2019. It is also 70% more than 10 year averaged earnings (with an adjustment for earnings growth and inflation to make it more realistic).

So we cannot possibly expect forward PE to give us a meaningful idea of the levels we are investing in! The danger is that forward PE may convince investors they will likely earn a 6.5% long term real annualized return (say 30 years) by investing at these levels and maybe a drawdown to say a 10PE would only mean a 50% decline.

However, more realistically, investors in SP500 will likely have a 4.7% real long term annualized return say (30 years) by investing in the SP500. Also if we are to revert to a 10 CAPE this could imply a crash as big as 75% in the near to medium term.

**TL;DR**

Your long term rate of return for the SP500 at these levels will not be 10% real. It will not even by 6.5% real which using the forward PE might imply. Instead it will likely be closer to 4.7% real with the risk of a drawdown as big as 75% in the near to medium term.

Now I'm not saying to hold cash, gold, crypto or whatever instead. I think stocks are the most sensible long term investment still because a 4.7% real return is still nice. However, they aren't for everyone! You will only realize this level of return in the long term and in the interim your portfolio could be down 50-75% meaning you would have a HEFTY penalty if you had to take out early. So is this hefty penalty worth it for the 5% real return? This is what we must ask.",1631297890,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/plqjeo/forward_pe_estimate_for_sp500_will_fall_short/

97,investing,ThorDansLaCroix,Major crisis were led by property crisis.,"Urban construction, modernisation and so, is the main investment done by governments to boost the economy, because urbanisation attracts investments and cities created big consume demands. But these investments are the major forces leasing to the main crises at least since 1870.

When France economy was starting getting weak in the middle of XIX century they invested in modernising Paris is a huge scale. It workerd to attract investment and to create demand for business but eventually it lead to the late 1860s crises resulting the the famous Paris Commune. The war against Bismark's Prussia was an other way to attempt to invest the eccess of capital.

The very same strategy was the urban development in NY and other major cities in America leading and the property crisis in the midle of 1920s preciding the big economic crash.

The  american suburb development in the 1940s excluding minorities, especially the black community,  and the bored suburb middle class kids, lead the 68 protests.

After changes in the economy for a more Neoliberal strategy, giving much more power to capitalists acumulation investments in urban development became more frequent and so the cycle of crisis.

The crisis of 1973 originated in a global property market crash; it wasn't really the oil prices as mainstream economics like to suggest. The property crash happen 6 months before the oil price hike and recession was well under way by the fall.

Commercial property lead the Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s in the US.

The end of Japan boom in 1990 corresponded to a collapse of land prices.

Nationalisation of Swedish banking system in 1992 because of eccess in property markets.

One of the teiggers for the collapse in East and South East Asia in 1997-98 was the eccessive urban development in Thailand.

Since urbain development have been intensified in the past 20 years I assume that keeping an eye on the property market is a good idea as a sinal for major crisis approaching.

The greater the share of property markets in GDP, the more significant the connection between financing and investment in the built environment becomes a major source of macro crisis.

In the US where housing mortgage was equivalent of 40% of GDP it mostly certainly generated  a crisis in 2007-09.",1631271198,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/plip72/major_crisis_were_led_by_property_crisis/
98,investing,JonDyna965,The demand for copper against the copper supply,"Seeing the current situation, I strongly believe that the demand for copper will just keep on rising, so the prices will also rise unless we find more copper or some other economic alternative.

This brings me to the question about the possibility of the supply to meet the demand. Copper is important for the production of electronic devices and of renewable sources of energy. To add to that, it is also important for everything that’s electric, manufacturing batteries, and even for solar panels. There is a high demand for it and it is unlikely that it will go down soon.

There are a lot of big mining companies that are producing massive amounts of copper such as Codelco. Just last year, Codelco was the largest producer of copper, producing 1.73 million tonnes, which was 1.3% higher than their last year’s performance. BHP, which owns the world’s largest copper mine, comes in second producing 1.77 million tonnes.

A lot of smaller companies are joining as well too, and are in for producing tons of the metal too as shown by their drilling results. I believe that these smaller and new companies will contribute greatly to the copper supply boost, which will also help ease the situation of the rising prices.

Among them is Three Valley Copper ([TVC.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tvc.v/)), a Canadian company producing pure copper cathodes from its mineral reserves. They recently released their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50% from Don Gabriel. The company expects high unit costs throughout the year until next year since they are aiming to operate below capacity until Papomono Masivo is in full production.

As years go by, I believe copper is going to be really critical and will be a mainstay in a lot of industries. I know that a lot of companies are striving to meet the demand for this metal, but if it does not match the rate of the increase on demand for copper, the supply will likely be short and the prices will continue to increase.",1631270936,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/plin6t/the_demand_for_copper_against_the_copper_supply/

86,investing,sxrg,Can someone please explain futures rollovers,"Hello,

Like the title says, I am curious about how the futures rollovers work particularly in the context of ES and NQ.

I see it appears that contracts for the next quarter begin trading today (9/9/21) for Dec expiry contracts. But that doesn't mean the contracts expiring next week have stopped trading. When does the ""roll"" for trading normally compete for Sept contracts? A week before expiry (ie tomorrow, Friday), or Wednesday before expiry..?

Were contracts for Dec and further forward expiry already trading prior to today or no?

Is the typical effect on the price as the contract expiration nears convergence to spot? Is it not the case that everyone who does not intend to actually take delivery will effectively begin to evaporate from the market as the expiration date nears? What's the last day for which those who do not intend to take delivery actively trade?(assuming T-1 to expiry but not sure)

Sorry if these are overly simplistic questions I don't have experience with futures contracts and any answers would be helpful and appreciated. Thank you.",1631199039,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pkzb6f/can_someone_please_explain_futures_rollovers/

**Original post:**

A lot of investors having been asking questions on what to look at when considering a stock, and where to find the information, so I put this guide together on the things I look at. I'm just a regular guy who's been investing for about 19 years, with a degree in finance/ accounting, and working in the finance field. I hope this helps.

There points below are basically the things I cover when I look at a stock, and where I get them from. (This list is in no particular order. Below is just my preference. Everyone's ""recipe"" is different. Find what works for you!

* **Know the company.** I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible. What do they do? How do they make money? Why are they important? What are their products?

1. Positives? Strengths? Moat? Advantages? Opportunities? Growth? Catalysts?
2. Downside? Negatives? Concerns? Weaknesses? Threats? Risks?

* **Growth**. I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news, 10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future growth. I find out out new products, or a changing landscape. How will the company scale?
* **Financial health**. Are the financials strong? Is the company financially healthy? Are cash flows from operations positive? How are Investing &amp; Financing Cashflows? Is net income growing? Are profit margins Getting better? Is the Quick ratio over 2 to sustain operations? Is EPS growing? Income Statement Trend, etc.

* **CEO, Management Team and Leadership:** I check Glassdoor and Indeed to learn about the management of the company, and google their CEO. A CEO with low/ bad ratings is a bad sign
* **Short selling.** How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it? If so, why are they?

What benefit is there to having such a low number of employees? Lower costs yes but with the money they control and need to invest surely it would make sense for them to have more than just 13 employees doing this?

Or is it because it's easier for them to conceal fraud when there's only a handful of people being exposed to it and most of them have a large interest in keeping the fraud going.

18,investing,Polite_Poet_alysis_,How I made more than 10% annual profit using microloans," 

Hi everyone!

I would like to tell you about my experience of investing in P2P lending platforms.

During my studies in the EU, my fellow students introduced me to the investments in P2P lending platforms.

2019 was the year of the lowest interest rates on deposits in the EU- fluctuated around 0.5-1% per annum, and this has been around for more than 2 years.

While all of them were receiving interest rates 20 times higher than in banks.

Everything got to the point that my fellow students, being EU citizens, began to take loans in banks and invest these funds in these microloans.

Sounds crazy, but it works for now.

I decided to try.

Having invested 8K, in 18 months I received 1258 Euros of income, which amounted to about 10.5% per annum.

After moving back to the United States, I discovered new opportunities with Prosper.

It was a terrible experience.

On Mintos, I was not limited in the amount of investment, and most importantly, I did not have any time limits, since the vast majority of loans were microloans for a short period (up to 2 months).

But in Prosper, you could invest for a period starting from 36 months, and the fee could reach up to 2%, in Mintos it is fixed at 0.85%.

In the end, I was refused because I could not show my gross income over 80.000 $ Plus.

Also, there was no secondary market on Prosper where you could quickly and with a premium resell your investment.

Fortunately, I still have a European SEPA bank account in Euros and continue to invest in Mintos.

Of course, the system is not perfect:

1) You can earn more than 12% (the maximum that can be earned on the platform is 30% per annum), but then you get into loans with a rating of C- and below, and defaults can sometimes reach more than 30%.

After all, the risk is all yours!

2) When transferring money to a European bank from the United States, after I left the EU, I had slight difficulties.

My payment was frozen by the bank due to suspected money laundering. I had to submit documents on the origin of money through the Bank of America, and explain why, being in the USA and being a US citizen, I transfer money to a European bank, and for what purposes it will be used. It is good that they did not demand to obtain a license for investment activities.

3) When converting from Dollars to Euros and from Euros to Dollars, you have to lose up to 4%.

From now on, I intend to increase my investment to 20K dollars, I will continue to invest in Mintos, and also try a new platform that uses crypt and promises interest rates two times higher than the European one.  


I will try to write monthly reports.

28,investing,djarnexus,RSUs and Taxes - What's the Math?,"So, using smart asset, I figured that my marginal tax rate is around 35%. If I sell $10k worth of RSUs right at the vest, $2.2k (22%) should have already withheld for me at the vest. My actual tax responsibility was $3.5k (35%). So this means that I would need to withhold $1.3k of what I sold to pay taxes at tax season.

If my usual tax return is about $1k, I'd now owe $300.

So on that sale of $10k, I actually keep $8.7k. If I didn't sell, I'd still be responsible for paying the $1.3k.

Are my math and reasoning correct here?

I.e., I'd need to always sell an extra 13% of my shares to pay for taxes at vest; I keep 87% of what I sell.",1631175942,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pktp5d/rsus_and_taxes_whats_the_math/

The Chinese government has temporarily suspended approval for all new online games in the country, dealing a fresh blow to the video gaming businesses of industry giants Tencent Holdings and NetEase, as Beijing steps up measures to tackle gaming addiction among young people, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  
That decision was revealed during a meeting on Wednesday called by Chinese authorities, led by the publicity department of the Chinese Communist Party and gaming watchdog the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), to discuss with representatives from Tencent and NetEase how they will implement Beijing’s new restrictions on video gaming for minors, according to a person briefed on the matter, but declined to be named because the information is private.

I read about call/put options here all the time, but I've never once seen anyone mention more ""exotic"" derivatives like Knock Out warrants (which I discovered through my broker recently).

I'm curious if people don't use them because they feel they're an inferior choice, because their broker simply doesn't have them and they haven't heard of them, or another reason.

(In simple terms, A KO C 12/99 warrant is like a call option that doesn't have a time limit, doesn't have time or volatility value (no greeks), but does have a KO limit where the whole contract is void if the underlying ever once crosses that point.

For example, a KO warrant on the S&amp;P 500 index with a KO limit of 4400 would be worth around $1 at the moment because the index is at around 4500. If it rises to 4600, the warrant is worth around $2, doubling the investment while the underlying moves 2% (note that this is exponential (flattening, not parabolic) because basically 4400 is the new 0 and the stock is now 200 instead of 100), while if it dipped to 4399 = game over.)

Seeing as you trade one kind of risk (KO) for another (Time decay / No volatility), but the profit potential is much higher than with regular calls (if going for a KO limit close to the current price, not otherwise but then it becomes pretty safe instead), I'm fairly intrigued and will try it out soon.

My main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.

I am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. 

I back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.

It might be a huge gem. The only question is, will this be just a flash in the pan or will it become a long-term, sustainable project?",1631151342,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pknwt9/nba_legend_tim_hardaway_officially_endorses_mini/

91,investing,ahmaddaud,Extending 'Islamic Finance' to Crypto is a pretty good investment," Exhibiting in London today and featured on CoinMarketCap; if you haven't been introduced to DFL- Supercup sponsor Caizcoin just yet, it's high time to learn it's merits. It's big, it's bold and it's a revolution for many.

I've held back from posting about this currency up until now mainly due to two reasons:

* I don't believe in posting the ""merits"" of something until I am confident enough to invest in it myself
* In the Crypto-sphere you need approach new projects with caution lest they turn out to be over-hyped, or worse, scams

Yet, I have never felt so comfortable writing about a project as I do this one, with both those reasons flung out the window - and soon you will see why this is a great opportunity present.

### What is Caizcoin?

Access the whitepaper [here](https://member.caizcoin.com/white-paper).

Caizcoin's ""developer team collaborated closely with worldwide scholars, famous economists, business professionals, and IT experts to create Caizchain, an innovative blockchain"" (CMC, 2021). It features:

* low transaction fees,
* a distributed ledger,
* a top-notch consensus algorithm,
* and transaction speeds that outperform all current blockchains
* user-intuitive interface,
* extensively tested its API on different factors to assure high-quality performance and scalability

&amp;#x200B;

The added kick? It appeals to a vast population of Muslims who are in pursuit of 'Islamic Compliant Finance' for their investments- notably, gamble and interest free.

It is estimated that 20 to 30% of Muslim majority countries, from the Middle East and South Asia exclusively participate in 'Islamic finance' as a pose to conventional financial products which often have attached mechanisms of interest. The market for this project is certainly there.

&amp;#x200B;

### Why CAIZ?

The Crypto industry is volatile - that's no secret - but throw in a mix of malicious actors and rug-pulls, there is further dissuasion in participating or adopting. Notably however, on CoinMarketCap, the Caizcoin project is designed in a way to:

&gt;*...to create a moral platform will be highly advantageous to small investors looking for secure investments. The Caiz team has stated on several occasions that their creative financial solution will assist the Muslim crypto community in multiplying the returns on their investments and that it will be beneficial to everybody, regardless of their background or religious affiliation. - CMC, 2021*

What is key to note here is that the **project seeks to extend itself to all realms of society,** and what is NOT is a project exclusively for Muslims. That is it's focal point but the investment opportunity is there for all individuals regardless of religion or nationality.

It is presently being offered at a rate more than **ten times higher** than it's first presale, with continuous demonstration of investor strength and demand leading to constant price growth.

Once the project comes to market, it is more than expected that the price will rise sky-high as it is not yet listed on any exchanges. It's the perfect time to get it on presale now.",1631125363,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pkg5es/extending_islamic_finance_to_crypto_is_a_pretty/

99,investing,fahrenheitc,"ASX: RBL. Redbubble, the next Etsy","Redbubble is an ASX-Listed online marketplace for independent artists that provides printed products. Here was there recent investor presentation. Most of their customers are based in North America amd Europe. They are currently heavily undervalued at around $1.1B AUD ($800M USD).

https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02408798-3A573176?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4

The company currently has aggressive plans to grow their revenue to $1.5B AUD by 2024, afterwards focusing more efforts on raising margins. Their CAGR for the past 5 years has been 41% on average. Guidance until 2024 is around 20-30% CAGR. Their current revenue is around $657M AUD with a gross profit of $223M AUD. 

Here are some of their key selling points. 

Their business is being pushed by 3 key trends: a) they are an emerging winner in a rapidly shifting landscape (personalisation of e-commerce goods), b) this is reinforcing the inherent flywheel (network) effects and c) the shift to e-commerce and online has been accelerated by COVID - this is a structural change, we aren't going back

They have a very strong balance sheet and a nice cash buffer ($99M). They are cash flow positive, generating $51M EBITDA for FY21. 

The valuation multiple is still extremely low and enticing at circa 2x MP revenue, compared to comparators at 10x revenue or more. 

I want to emphasise the comparison between Etsy here because their business model is inherently similar, utilizing the incredibly rare flywheel effect between artists and customers. Their growth rate is also very similar. At current revenue, my estimates would put them at 3-4 years behind Etsy. 

Etsy Revenue (USD)

2015 - 273M 
2016 - 364M
2017 - 441M
2018 - 603M
2019 - 818M
2020 - 1.7B

Redbubble Revenue (AUD). 

2019 - 306M
2020 - 416M
2021 - 657M
2024 - 1.5B Target

Etsy's has appreciated 25x over the past 4-5 years. Not only did Etsy's valuation increase with its revenues, but also its revenue multiple too. The current difference in valuation between Etsy and RBL is around 37x. 

Mostly because RBL is listed on the ASX and relatively unknown globally (yet). Also because Australian funds are typically value investors. OTCMKTS is RDBBY. 

The Australian Tech scene is actually fairly well developed with Atlassian, Afterpay and Xero. Redbubble is shaping up to be the next giant, currently with a very attractive valuation that could yield significant returns in the upcoming years as they start to get noticed by the big NASDAQ players.",1631120325,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pkeht1/asx_rbl_redbubble_the_next_etsy/
4,investing,AwesomeMathUse,The Original Bitcoin Protocol: What Is It and Why Does It Matter? [MNP Report],"[MNP](https://www.mnp.ca/en/insights/directory/the-original-bitcoin-protocol-what-is-it-and-why-does-it-matter)

**Synopsis**

As Bitcoin creates waves, our team steps back to examine the origins of the cryptocurrency. Read our whitepaper to gain an in-depth understanding of the technology and it’s applicability.

In the last 10 years, concepts like blockchain and digital currencies have moved from small online communities to being supported by some of the world’s largest firms. These concepts and ideas were best presented by Satoshi Nakamoto in the creation of Bitcoin. With the rise in popularity, and the different offerings, MNP found it necessary to investigate what Bitcoin implementation best fits Nakamoto’s original vision.

Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” sets the stage for our analysis. Nakamoto’s whitepaper, emails, forum posts, and original source code define the protocol — the rule set for Bitcoin as a data network — and the key elements that make Bitcoin a functional technology. Along with the whitepaper, we reviewed the publicly available emails, forum posts, and original code left by Nakamoto. We used these source materials to determine what Nakamoto’s original purpose for Bitcoin was – a global electronic cash system (that works peer-to-peer), while also laying the foundation for a network that can support more advanced data applications.

Using the sources mentioned above, we developed an assessment framework and related criteria assessing the relevance of the Bitcoin scripting language (including OpCodes incorporated in it), protocol elements, and capabilities in current implementations — Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) against Nakamoto’s original vision.

Our findings indicate that BSV is most representative of Nakamoto’s original intention and design for Bitcoin. One key factor is because the BSV blockchain demonstrates the ability to scale to support significant volumes of transactions in a timely manner for macro-payments and even micropayments, resulting from BSV’s “Genesis” hard fork in February 2020. This removed any arbitrary cap on block size and allows the BSV blockchain and transaction capacity to grow unbounded, while also removing state restrictions limits and improving the code base to allow for unbounded scaling. In addition, the Genesis hard fork restored key aspects of the original functionality of Bitcoin script, the programming language used within the Bitcoin protocol. In our whitepaper, we also identify what technology capabilities can be enabled once Nakamoto’s vision for Bitcoin has been fully realized.

A general outline of report is as follows:

* The Bitcoin Whitepaper
* Nakamoto’s known Forum Posts, Emails
* The Original Bitcoin Protocol
   * Capabilities
   * Critical components
   * Non-functional requirements
   * Implementation attributes
* Comparison of current Bitcoin implementations to Nakamoto’s original vision
* Impact of Nakamoto’s vision once fully realized.

9,investing,investing-scientist2,Six dividend stocks with great ratings and strong fundamentals: worth consideration?,"

Here is a couple of stocks that might be worth your  attention this week. They were selected using a couple of criteria –  most of them heavily rely an the company’s fundamentals; the analysts  recommendations are only provided as a kind of support for the  hand-picked names. This is why I’m calling the approach a **consensus strategy.**  The stocks I’m going to present you below are generally believed to  outperform the stock market in the coming months, they have a consensus  recommendation of Buy, their fundamentals are scored considerably better  than most stocks and their average target price by stock analysts is  above current market valuation.

In order to consider buying the stock’s shares, the following criteria need to be satisfied:

&amp;#x200B;

* **TheStreet score**: A+, A or A-
* **Zacks Rank**: 1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold)
* **Weiss Ratings recommendation**: A or B
* **Yahoo Finance recommendation**: at least mixed Buy/Hold
* **Yahoo Finance target price**: min. 5% higher than current price
* **Piotroski F-Score**: min. 4
* **InvestorsObserver Overall Score**: min. 50  
 

**Note**: Descriptions of those criteria are provided at the end of this post as well as [HERE](https://www.investing-scientist.com/research/top-stocks-to-buy-a-consensus-strategy/).             

&amp;#x200B;

If you decide to buy any of the below stocks, you might want to  consider the following selling conditions (at least one of them should  be satisfied):

* price is higher or close to target
* profit is in range 20% – 30%
* loss is higher than 50%
* TheStreet recommendation is changed to Sell
* Weiss Ratings recommendation is changed to Sell
* Yahoo Finance recommendation is changed to Sell

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *– The stock has an excellent track  record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering  the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced  volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to  maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past  performance is just an indication — not a guarantee — we believe this  fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total  return potential over a 12-month period including both price  appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell  ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a  general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our  model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective***  *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities  market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and  forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of  past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so  we’re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The  Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s  shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the  market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500’s +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has  an excellent track record for providing strong performance with  lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents  good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past  performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this  stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a  down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the  equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good  track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While  the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our  opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for  outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a  down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects  nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company’s financial  situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency.  Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [t](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean)heir website:

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores  (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric.  This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating  stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely  to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish  case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

I hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this  stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.

Class-A shares with a sales charge of 5.75% WOW. I'm tasked with building her a portfolio with aggressive risk and 100% equities. She's 28 and this won't be her forever job and we plan to roll over the IRA to Vanguard when she leaves.  


How do I pick the lesser of evils? None of these funds seem to track the S&amp;P 500. All funds seem to be heavily weighted with front loads and minimal returns compared to my (managed) Vanguard portfolio. I want to set her up for success but it's hard to do so when this is the only option her employer offers. Any suggestions on how to keep her portfolio fees low and based in American equities?

15,investing,-prooof,How does investing in a company actually impact the company itself?,"This is basic I know but I can't really put my finger on why we invest other than hoping people pay more for it later. My understanding is that a company cashes out when they IPO, they sell some shares on the public market and that's their profit to use as they choose. And then potentially they keep some shares private and if that grows, they can sell those shares as well (or issue new ones from thin air). But other than that, after the IPO, it's mostly just other people changing hands of shares- why would a company care what it's stock price / valuation is?",1631110628,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pkbedr/how_does_investing_in_a_company_actually_impact/
18,investing,mrfilthynasty4141,Need some advice on tax lot stock sale methods," 

On TDA you can assign any sale of stock to a specific purchase in the past. This enables one to manage which shares you are selling at any given time, as opposed to having the FIFO method execute your trade by default. First in first out (for those unaware). There are other methods such as LIFO (last in last out), High cost first out, low cost first out, etc....

I have been averaging into Draftkings as a long term position, but have found that I also enjoy swing trading the stock due to the fact that I have been holding it and have become rather familiar with its movements/patterns. I purchased a few extra shares back in May around $42-$43 for the sake of reselling sometime in the near future around 60. The plan worked as expected and I sold a handful of shares yesterday for around 63.50...TDA requires the user to log in the following day to adjust the tax lot method or to assign a sale to a specific purchase. The stock does not settle for a couple days and this can be done anytime prior to settlement after the day the stock was sold. So...With that being said. This is my question...I notice I have shares from back in March of this year as well with a higher average of around $60. I have my other shares from May and they have an average of $43. My main position was purchased awhile ago (last year), and is averaged around 50 with shares purchased all over the place. I guess I am wondering if it would be wise to sell the shares purchased at $60 back in March instead - I would barely be breaking even on them, locking in next to no profit, but would inadvertently lower my cost basis and would leave the profit I could have taken on the table. This is all for the sake of having those shares for 1+ years and being able to hold them comfortably without having to risk losing any of my initial investment/capital...Or would it be wiser to take the profit I can take off of the shares purchased in May at $40 and simply keep the others until the cost rises. I guess I feel like delaying the profit taking until the shares have matured in my portfolio for a year or more would be wise so I am not paying as much tax? If i take profit now I pay the tax on it. If I sell my higher cost shares and just barely break even (nothing to pay tax on here). This enables me to sell the other shares with a lower cost basis (and therefor a higher likelihood of being profitable) later on without having to be taxed on the profit.

# THE ONLINE BETTING industry 

The market is worth $67 billion today and is estimated to reach about $93 billion by 2023—growing at roughly 11.5% per annum.

There are few reasons for the aggressive growth, First, more of our activities are taking place online, a trend that extends to betting as well.

The second is regulation. The U.S. Supreme Court uplifted the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in May of 2018 to legalize sports betting on a federal level. Since then, 25 states have legalized sports betting.

# SPORTS BETTING

The most popular activity by far is [sports betting](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/americas-multi-billion-dollar-sports-betting-industry/), which makes up over 40% of the total online betting market.

# DraftKings

DraftKings's revenue keeps surging YOY, in Q2-2021 revenue reached $297,605M which is a 22% higher sales compared to the analyst expectations. last year the company delivered $74,998M in revenue.

The company also said that it had grown the number of monthly unique payers by 281% and the average revenue per monthly unique payer by 26%. In other words, fundamental growth was very strong.

Even though I really think that the potential for growth here is clear, the company still losing a lot of money, Cost of revenue spiked this quarter to $187,006M from $53,172M, and new loss reached $305,526M - even more than DraftKings's revenue.

28,investing,Spirited-Pause,Why 'Common Prosperity’ Has China’s Billionaires Running for Cover,"[https://time.com/6095560/china-common-prosperity/](https://time.com/6095560/china-common-prosperity/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In a sign of how far China’s leaders  have drifted from their revolutionary roots, the biggest shock gripping  the country today is that the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) might  actually be socialist after all.  
&gt;  
&gt;The shakeup  centers on the phrase “common prosperity.” It was first introduced by  revolutionary leader Mao Zedong but has now been taken up as the  defining mantra of a new era as imagined by current strongman President  Xi Jinping.  
&gt;  
&gt;In an Aug. 17 speech to the CCP’s  Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs—his first since the  secretive, annual summer leadership conclave at the seaside town of  Beidaihe—Xi [declared](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/18/c_1310133051.htm)  that “Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism and a  key feature of Chinese-style modernization.” He used the phrase 15 times  in total in his address and it’s become a refrain ever since.  
&gt;  
&gt;[According](http://politics.people.com.cn/BIG5/n1/2021/0817/c1024-32197305.html) to the official *People’s Daily*,  the goal is to build a more egalitarian China by “expanding the  proportion of middle-income groups, increasing the incomes of low-income  groups, reasonably adjusting high incomes \[and\] banning illegal  incomes.” Nobody doubts that the CCP would also like to leverage common  prosperity to reassert its authority over China’s high-fliers.   
&gt;  
&gt;“These  billionaires and tech companies are very risky to the CCP because they  are seen as an alternative form of social and political power,” says  David Moser, associate dean of the Yenching Academy at Peking  University.  
&gt;  
&gt;  📷  An  investor watches an electric screen displaying stock price figures at a  stock exchange hall on February 18, 2021 in Shanghai, China. VCG/VCG via Getty Images)        
&gt;  
&gt;In response, skittish  investors have started dumping their stock. Up to $1 trillion has been  wiped off the valuation of Chinese firms since February, after  regulators began targeting electronic payment providers, real estate  developers, private tuition companies (a vast, $120 billion industry in  education-hungry China) and the gaming sector. The latter—a giant and  highly lucrative market generating $44 billion in earnings last year—is  now reeling from new directives banning children from playing more than  three hours of online games a week.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s the  biggest socio-economic change since reformist leader Deng Xiaoping  unleashed market forces in the late 1970s. In words that have since  become infamous, Deng propelled the country’s export-driven resurgence  with the exhortation: “Let some people get rich first.” Many forget that  he went on to say that those allowed to achieve wealth would be  expected to “lead other regions and people to gradually achieve common  prosperity.” His successors now look poised to make good on the bargain.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Read more:** [*What the Crackdown on China’s Tech Firms Is Really About*](https://time.com/6079877/china-ipo/)  
&gt;  
&gt;A senior CCP official [said last month](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3146438/chinas-common-prosperity-push-does-not-mean-killing-rich)  that “common prosperity” does not mean “killing the rich to help the  poor.” But rumors are swirling that Beijing may bring in property,  inheritance, and capital gains taxes to level the playing field in a  society where the top 1% now control 31% of wealth, according to Credit  Suisse—up from 21% two decades ago. The preferential 10% tax rate  enjoyed by internet companies is also expected to be rolled back in  favor of the standard 25% corporate rate.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Xi is  saying, ‘Hey, I found the magic sauce,'” explains Sung Wen-Ti, a  scholar specializing in the CCP leadership at the Australian National  University. “‘I’m going to continue to use this socialist market economy  to encourage economic growth, while redistributing wealth in a way that  doesn’t lead us back to the Mao Zedong days of poverty.’”

&gt;  
&gt;The meaning of common prosperity  
&gt;  
&gt;In July, [to mark the CCP’s centenary](https://time.com/6077358/china-communist-party-centenary-xi-jinping/),  Xi announced that the goal of building “a moderately prosperous society  in all respects” was complete, having already declared [absolute poverty eradicated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56194622#:~:text=Chinese%20President%20Xi%20Jinping%20says,been%20lifted%20out%20of%20poverty.).  By 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic, the goal is to “build a  modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic,  culturally advanced and harmonious.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course,  “democratic” means different things in China than it does in the West,  but there’s no doubt that the goal of a “socialist country” is more  important to Xi than it was to his immediate predecessors. So far,  celebrities who flaunt their wealth and welch on taxes have found  themselves abruptly taken off the Chinese internet. Officials have also [announced](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008371/beijings-top-teachers-will-rotate-shifts-across-schools)  the ramping up of a scheme to rotate the best teachers among different  schools in order to equalize education standards. Ride-hailing firm Didi  and e-commerce platform JD.com have meanwhile moved to establish trade  unions for their staff, who until now have typically been employed  casually via third-party contractors, receiving paltry benefits. But the  central government has offered little specific guidance as to what  socialism and common prosperity mean in practice.   
&gt;  
&gt;The  vagueness mirrors an anti-corruption drive started by Xi in 2012.  Instead of new laws and regulations to ensure transparency and  accountability, that purge instead borrowed from the ancient Chinese  tactic of “kill a chicken to scare the monkeys,” says Moser—making an  example of [1.5 million officials](https://www.efe.com/efe/english/world/china-punishes-more-than-1-5-million-officials-for-corruption/50000262-3412841), a comparatively small number, to send a clear message to all 90 million apparatchiks that graft was no longer tolerated.  
&gt;  
&gt;This  is the context in which China’s wealthiest have been left to interpret  the implications of common prosperity for themselves. Unsurprisingly,  they have been throwing money at the problem, pouring billions into  charitable foundations as a gesture of appeasement.

&gt;  
&gt;On Thursday, Jack Ma’s e-commerce giant Alibaba [pledged](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/alibaba-pledges-15-5-billion-to-xi-s-common-prosperity-drive?sref=KQ64K3tR&amp;mc_cid=4a3df73e6c&amp;mc_eid=1f68a91ab9)  100 billion renminbi ($15.5 billion) to fund common prosperity  initiatives until 2025. That came on top of an earlier pledge of 100  billion renminbi from Tencent, and 10 billion renminbi from bosses at  each of Pinduoduo, Xiaomi and Meituan, for various social projects.  Alibaba had already been in the spotlight after regulators fined the  firm $2.8 billion and nixed the $37 billion IPO of its fintech arm, Ant  Group, which was subsequently ordered to restructure. Notably, the  firm—along with several of China’s most profitable corporations—is based  in Zhejiang province, chosen as “a demonstration zone for achieving  common prosperity,” [according](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/10/c_1310001320.htm) to the official Xinhua news agency.

&gt;“Xi  doesn’t want to be seen as someone who’s in league with these giant  tech companies and billionaires, so he’s cracking down on them,” says  Moser. “It’s a populist move so ordinary people feel the CCP is on their  side.”   
&gt;  
&gt;Reading the political winds, many of  China’s most famous tycoons have quietly stepped back from boardroom  positions in recent weeks to take roles with a social focus.

A debt crisis could send shockwaves through China's banking system.,"[https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrande-bonds-suspended-prices-slump-2021-09-06/](https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrande-bonds-suspended-prices-slump-2021-09-06/)

&gt;SHANGHAI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Bonds issued by indebted developer China Evergrande Group [**(3333.HK)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/3333.HK) slumped on Monday after a ratings downgrade led to restrictions on their use as collateral, prompting China's stock exchanges to halt trade.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Shanghai Stock Exchange said in a statement that it had temporarily suspended trading in China Evergrande Group's 6.98% July 2022 corporate bond following ""abnormal fluctuations."" The exchange had also suspended trading in the bond on Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shanghai exchange data showed the bonds sliding more than 25% to a low of 40.18 yuan after the resumption of trade on Monday afternoon. The company's 5.9% May 2023 Shenzhen-traded bond , which was also suspended, fell more than 35% after trading resumed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The slump in bond prices comes after a ratings downgrade erased the bonds' value for use in pledged repo trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rules governing pledged repos require bonds issued after April 7, 2017 and pledged as collateral to be rated AAA, while issuers must have credit ratings of AA or higher. Bonds issued before that date - including Evergrande's July 2022 bond - need only be rated AA or higher.  
&gt;  
&gt;China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co (CCXI) downgraded Evergrande and its onshore bonds to AA from AAA on Thursday, and placed the company and its bonds on a watchlist for further downgrades.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Friday, China Securities Depository and Clearing Co. (CSDC) reduced the ""conversion ratio"" of the July 2022 bond to zero, effective Sept. 7. Other Evergrande bonds were not included in CSDC's table of conversion ratios on Friday as they no longer qualified for inclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;The conversion ratio determines leverage limits for repo financing given a specific bond pledged as collateral. CSDC is owned by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.  
&gt;  
&gt;A director at a local brokerage said that the reduction in the conversion ratio was a ""grey rhino"" - a highly obvious yet ignored threat. ""It was bound to happen.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Evergrande declined to comment. But in a statement on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Monday, it acknowledged the impact of the rating downgrade on the bonds' use as pledged repo collateral. It said the bonds had previously been deemed appropriate only for qualified institutional investors, and the downgrade had no impact on investor suitability.

Coupa has not reconciled its expectations for non-GAAP income from operations to GAAP loss from operations, or non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated to GAAP net loss per share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated because certain items excluded from non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated, such as charges related to stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, gain or loss on conversion of convertible senior notes, the adjustment attributable to non-controlling interests, and related tax effects, including non-recurring income tax adjustments, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. In addition, the effect of the anti-dilutive impact of the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the company's offerings of convertible notes in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. The effect of these items may be significant.

I’m 32 years old with a 401k sitting right around 100k at the moment that my wife’s company manages for us for free (great job perk). I contribute 8% and my company matches 6%. 

My job requires me to drive a bit and I get a mileage reimbursement check every month. For the past 6 months or so, I have taken that (average of $500/month) and put it into another brokerage account that I manage. This is mostly me wanting to have a little more risk in my investments and to also invest in companies I like. 


However, I can’t seem to find any overall guides for newer investors like myself for “non-retirement” investments. Obviously the goal across the board is to be financially stable when it comes to retirement time but I also want to be able to learn the market and see actual returns based on what I’ve learned. Every guide I come across seems to be just investing for retirement but I want to learn more than just that. Some of you may say just have it all go to retirement and forget about it but again, I want to learn and see if I can’t create profits for myself. I’ve done some basic research and am already investing with a diverse portfolio but I want to take it up a notch and really start to analyze these companies deeper for future gains.

Are these type of guides out there that don’t go directly towards a typical retirement account?",1631050895,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pjwmsu/investing_guides_for_nonretirement_investors/

He uses a coin flip showing 10 rounds and both players get a loss of different values.  Each time, the win/loss is 1/2 the prior amount.

But here's the part I don't understand.  In round one the net value of the two players is 2000, in round two, the net value is 1500.

Each time you have a heads (except the last one) the net values for the players stays the same, every time you get a tail the net value goes down, but up for one.

The part I don't understand is that if you run a heads/tails over a long run, it comes out near 50/50, so I'm not clear on the relationship between the two and how neither can win.",1631041194,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pjthok/can_someone_explain_this_video_inverse_etf_using/

&amp;#x200B;

1. The S&amp;P 500 is trading at a lofty 22.5 times forward earnings and its price-to-sales ratio of 3.1 times is far costlier than in 2000. The Nasdaq-100 tracking QQQ exchange-traded fund [**QQQ,** **0.14%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/QQQ?mod=MW_story_quote) is trading at a 70% premium to its 200-week moving average, the biggest since 1999/2000. 
2. “Blank-check” or special-purpose acquisition companies where investors have no idea what the investment will be. “The last time SPACs were as big as they are today? That’s right [1928/1929](http://marketwatch.com/articles/spacs-are-red-hot-why-that-could-spell-trouble-51614995100?mod=article_inline),” said the strategist.
3. Leverage highs. Similar to 1920 and 2000, margin debt has shot to new highs, which is fine until it starts heading the other way. It has recently started to unwind and if that keeps going, markets have a problem
4. 4. Cryptocurrencies. Maley said he’s bullish longer-term on cryptos, but is concerned about “froth,” given a 1,000% gain for bitcoin since the Federal Reserve’s massive quantitative easing program began in 2020, with Ethereum up 3,400%. 
5. 5. Individual investors make up 20% of average daily volume for stocks, twice the level of two years ago. Many big market tops of the past — 1929, 1999/2000 — were marked by big jumps in investor activity.
6. 6.

32,investing,Cool-Statement-6959,The new mining policy in Ecuador and how will it affect the country,"Just last month, Guillermo Lasso, the president of Ecuador, issued Decree 151 which focuses on a new mining policy, strengthening the government’s support towards mining as a key driver of the economy.

According to this [article](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in-ecuador-2021-08-09), “The decree lays out a clear action plan and timeframe that has a primary objective of developing an efficient, environmentally and socially responsible mining industry in Ecuador, to promote national and foreign investment and to implement the best practices for the exploitation of these resources.”

To be honest, I am not surprised by this knowing how supportive the president is when it comes to bringing in more investors to the country. He has his background since he was a former banker and knows how important it is to bring in investors to improve the economy.

Because of this new decree, the activities of mining companies will improve even more. Just recently, Solaris Resources’ ([SLSSF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/community/)) Warintza project produced some results, with the initial hole at East was drilled to a total depth of 1,213m with assays reported for the first 320m of core returning 0.46% of CuEq from the surface, including 54 meters of 0.70% CuEq. This is only the beginning though since the company plans to focus on resource expansion. They have been performing really well lately, despite that recent dip a few weeks back.

SolGold ([SOLG.L](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/solg.l/)), another mining company whose mines are located in Ecuador, also released its regional exploration update. Their Hole 1 at Varela is testing underneath outcropping porphyry-style vein stockworks which returned encouraging surface rock-saw channel sample results of 99m @ 0.34% CuEq including 25.1m @ 0.58% CuEq. 

But along with the decree is the promise of responsible mining and the inclusivity of the local community. Hopefully, these mining companies will stay true to their own projects of involving the local communities in these mines and making sure that there will be no over-exploitation of mineral resources. After all, the mining industry will definitely affect Ecuador’s economy in a positive way, the same way it helped its neighboring countries in South America.",1631017311,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pjlzcs/the_new_mining_policy_in_ecuador_and_how_will_it/

Long story short,I am taken away by how much euphoria is currently here in the market.I haven’t even been in the market for a year and I have seen people in my circle turn into financial advisors who one year ago had zero to no knowledge of the markets. 
People seem to make banks on shit and meme coins with zero to no basic knowledge of how even the blockchain works.My tiktok news feed is full of people giving financial advise on useless projects.
People are selling digital jpeg images for hundreds of thousands.

Here is the meat and potatoes of the law:

&gt;*Art. 1.* The purpose of this law is to regulate bitcoin as unrestricted legal tender with liberating power, unlimited in any transaction, and to any title that public or private natural or legal persons require carrying out.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is mentioned in the previous paragraph does not hinder the application of the Monetary Integration law.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 2.* The exchange rate between bitcoin and the United States dollar, subsequently USD, will be freely established by the market.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 3.* Prices may be expressed in bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 4.* Tax contributions can be paid in bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 5.* Exchanges in bitcoin will not be subject to capital gains tax, just like any legal tender.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 6.* For accounting purposes, the USD will be used as the reference currency.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Art. 7.*** **Every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service.**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 8.* Without prejudice to the actions of the private sector, the State shall provide alternatives that allow the user to carry out transactions in bitcoin and have automatic and instant convertibility from bitcoin to USD if they wish. Furthermore, the State will promote the necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access bitcoin transactions.

This isn't just making Bitcoin legal tender as some publicity stunt/gimmick, it's full on requiring that ""every economic agent must accept Bitcoin as payment"" as mentioned in Article #7. 

This is a bold move for El Salvador and a big milestone for Bitcoin. How do you think this will work out for El Salvador over the coming years? Will other countries follow?

75,investing,Octoberandseptember,After Covid-19: Former Google Taiwan Director Foresees Super-Unicorn Startups,"As COVID-19 wreaked havoc across the globe, putting countless businesses on the brink of collapse, it has also given birth to new business opportunities oriented to remote working. In fact, the pandemic-driven “Work-From-Home” economy has led to a growing number of unicorns – startups with valuations above $1 billion. According to CB Insights, in the first half of 2021 alone, 203 unicorns have emerged worldwide. 

As the total number of these unicorns has tipped to above 700 around the world, Taiwan is mooted to be one of those locations with a high potential to pump out world-class unicorns. Speaking at Connect 2021 (Link in Chinese), a leading Taiwanese tech forum co-organized by TechTaiwan, Google Taiwan’s former director Dr. Lee-Feng Chien offered his insight on Taiwan’s startup and investment environment, outlining the challenges faced by Taiwanese startups and the country’s significance to the global investment community. 

“Taiwan’s capital market has started paying attention to digital economy.”

At the moment, Taiwan already has three unicorns. The most prominent among them is Gogoro, a leading e-bike manufacturer that has been expanding its presence in the US, Europe and India. Another unicorn is 91APP, a software company that facilitates small merchants to launch e-commerce apps. The third unicorn, Appier, is an AI software company founded in 2012, counting among its investors SoftBank Group and Temasek Holding, and has recently gone public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, raising  US$130 million. In fact, Appier is the first Taiwanese company to be listed in Japan since 1998.


Lee-Feng Chien, former Managing Director of Google Taiwan. Source: TechTaiwan

“The success of 91APP signifies that Taiwan’s capital market has started paying attention to digital economy, willing to give it a higher valuation,” observed Chien who, in his time as Google Taiwan’s director, oversaw its foundation from scratch, and eventually made it Google’s largest hardware R&amp;D hub outside of the US. By introducing three data centers, Google also laid the foundation of Taiwan’s data economy. 

“Appier’s listing means that Taiwanese startups have the capability to make it abroad,” Chien commented, expressing his optimism toward Taiwanese startup scene’s recent developments. According to the Google veteran, if more startups can expand beyond Taiwan as Appier has done before, it will be a boost to Taiwan’s digital economy. Constrained by the size of real economy though, startups in the digital economy sector have so far accounted little in Taiwan’s GDP. 

The rise of super-unicorn startups

The wave of digital transformation ushered in by the pandemic, however, is regarded by Chien as the opportunity of the decade for Taiwanese startups. He noted that COVID-19 altered the traditionally conservative investment strategy of private equity funds. As investment returns dropped, private equity funds have increasingly moved into venture capital investments. 

This latest development is simultaneously a challenge and a chance to Taiwan’s startup landscape: while it pushes unicorn startups to the forefront of post-pandemic global economic revival by funnelling in the surplus in the capital market, creating so-called “super-unicorns” valued above US$10 billion in the process, it also diverts investments away from early-stage startups. 

“It is the best time to fundraise for startups, but not necessarily for launching them,” Chien observed. Under these circumstances, he pointed out that in addition to the home market, Taiwanese startups would have to secure at least one overseas market , just like Appier did, to attract the global capital market. The internet-based digital world, he observed, could lower the threshold with its borderless nature, and Chien considered it a must for Taiwanese unicorns to engage with this platform to expand its horizon. 

However, Chien also set his sight beyond digital economy, considering its growth peak to be over and competition already too fierce. Instead, he identified space, especially the satellite industry, to be the likelier sectors from which the next unicorns will emerge.",1630980145,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pjdlg3/after_covid19_former_google_taiwan_director/

This percentage of short interest might already make it interesting however not my thing but could only help.  On Friday the SEC posted several 13D Forms (Investors notifying they own over 10% of the company.  Regulation requires them to notify the SEC, the company and the public).  

13D Forms are also one of the core steps before announcing interest to acquire the company (could be amicable or hostile. Yet to see).  Lastly the stock just hit it downside resistance.  So the way I see it while it’s far from a quality stock it’s also more than prime for a decent to very large pump if the market likes what the activist have to offer.

Global investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.

""Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,"" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.

China is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.

Meanwhile, CSRC will conduct ""pragmatic"" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.

Yi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a ""zero-sum game"", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.

Global financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, ""rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries"", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.

Yi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.

China will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated ""Panda bonds"" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.

China will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.

Fang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.

I live in the US. The organization I wish to invest in is in another country, specifically in the South East Asia region. I want to emphasize that I lived most of my life in that country and I am aware of how the economy is in general.

E-sports is a growing community and I am a ""gamer"" myself as well as a hobby streamer.

Now, I sent a message to this growing organization telling them that I wish to invest. I wish to invest $1000 minimum which is a big amount when converted into that country's currency. I can invest more but I wish to know more about the company itself before committing.

Now, once I get their attention and we set up a meeting, what information do I ask for them to ensure that I get my ROI?

I looked up a few things online and I thought about the following:

\- Mission and Vision

\- Projections in 5 years

\- Plans and Projects in the future if they can disclose them to me

\- Organizational Chart (Who owns the business and how long they've been in the industry)

\- Legal needs on how we can secure my investment

What information should I ask on their end? What information should I also give them? Emphasizing that I only wish to give financial investments. But I can also give them access to materials here in the US that are not available in the SEA regions since I have connections with a trusted Freight Forwarder.

1 dollar/unit would give #NEON 173$ per share - closed yesterday @ 5,17

How is this possible and what are the odds? 

Neonode owns the patent to the swipe technology and launched the first touchscreen phone in 2002.

The phone had small success at the time and the company changed focus.

In the great patent war between #AAPL and #SMSN 2016 Samsung overturned a huge verdict based on patent invalidity.

From the ruling: Samsung presented two prior art references, the NeoNode N1 Quickstart Guide (“Neonode”) from 2004 and a video and paper by Plaisant that were presented at a computer-human-interactivity conference in 1992. “We reverse the judgment of infringement and no invalidity because the asserted claim of the ’721 patent would have been obvious in light of Neonode and Plaisant.

New management in Neonode contacted IP specialists Aequitas in 2019 to se if they had a case against Apple and Samsung. In 2020 they filed suit for IP Infringment on patent 993 and 879

Samsung and Apple joined suit and challanged the patent in sept 2020 in IPR - this process will either nullify the patent or give the Neonode side a huge win.

They used the same tacticts as samsung aginst apple - Prior art in other patents.

The IPR Board agreed on one patent 993 - the Patent is up for discussion. 879 stands! To be made unvalid on grounds of earlier patents A/S argues:
Combination of Hisatomi / Ren or Hansen / Gillespie

Hisatomi 2002-02-20
Ren 2000/09
Hansen 1998-10-13
GIllespi 2002-04-17

Neonode have invention date 2002-12-19.It turns out have Neon had an ace up their sleeve.

Yesterday Neonode filed for discovery in Sweden and questioning of the inventor Magnus Goertz.

They searched for the originals of 3 documents already in their posseion all proving the invention took place around May 2001. This kills Apple/Samsungs prior art argument and makes the Patent stand on merit.

And for the trial and Jury in texas they want another document:
The signed licensdeal with samsung from 2005 that samsung never paid.All documentation from discussion about licensing with APPLE from 2005-2010
These documents will prove the value of the technology in 2005 - probably higher then 1 $ per unit?

They will also prove without doubt that Apple and Samsung knew about the infringment

IF IPR stands their will be a Jury trial in Texas for Judge Allan albright or settlement

How do you think a Jury would react to the licensing deal?

Or samsungs defence against apple that the patent is owned på Neonode and NOT paying them a cent?

The optics of this case is spectacular and the risk reward extreme.Neonode is a company now producing touchless touch for elevators and kiosks. It is just ramping up after corona and probably will turn from loss to profit in 2022. The client list include NEC and Schindler.

- Largest generation in history with many retail investors with higher conviction, than possibly any time in history mixed with gamification and democratization of financial markets 
- Supportive central banks with large debts that might make it favorable to keep interest rates lower for longer. Perhaps the beginning of modern monetary theory playing out
- Information Age where market participants have their finger in the pulse of the markets more than ever. Could lead to faster mini market cycles followed by fewer and farther in between large long lasting drops. Participants acutely aware of opportunity that arises from large dips historically

I have recently been interested in Morningstar’s ETF rating system which has been a popular tool used for ranking ETFs and i wanted to do an experiment or judging of sorts on this system because picking the correct ETF for long term investing and sustainability is extremely important especially with compounded growth, dividend reinvestment, and the fact that most people can not the spend the time I did and usually can just spend a little time looking at articles or have to listen to financial advisors for ETF recommendation which may not always be the best idea considering not all of your financial advisors incentives are/will be aligned with yours. I have personal experience with this considering my father who has cash that needs to be invested in his 401k and also my grandparents which are aiming for sustainability in their portfolio allowing for them not to worry too much about their withdrawal percentage each year.


To start it off, You are able to check on Morningstar to see all of their 5 star ratings on ETFs which have varying risk return ratios

I have done the arduous task of narrowing down and categorizing these ETFs in their sector both identified by Morningstar and by different preferences.

In my first wave of narrowing, I searched up each ETF and looked at the 5 year price history, other analyst rating available besides Morningstar, dividend yields (relative to expectation and ETF type), Morningstar risk/return ratings, and long term sector/industry outlook for the respective ETFs.

From the about 140 5-star ETFs rated by Morningstar, only 91 remain from the previous criteria mentioned.

I then categorized the remaining 91 ETFs into their categories for comparison between sector ETFs to find which are the best picks:

	From this categorization we can see that the out of my narrowed down 91 ETFs from the original 140ish, it is a very well diversified portfolio of ETFs and represent many sectors in the global economy except for the energy sector which, besides new and renewable energy industries, isn’t poised for growth in the long term.

I may do a second part to this where analyze each ETF in each industry or in each ETF type more thoroughly especially for the categories labeled “(broad)” and may give my own rating on ETFs I find interesting since some of the large cap, dividend, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P are doing strategies such as futures contracts or covered calls which differ from the standard equity etf found in these sectors.

After this second part I will or someone would If they like to create a final comparison between the final narrowed down portfolio and the benchmark category I created.

So how do the investors ever get their money back? I can understand the equity may appreciate as the business grows, but how and and when will it ever materialize into cash?

TLDR; how to find undervalued stocks by comparing the 11 sectors and small, medium and large market cap companies. 

First I have a yahoo finance chart that tracks the baseline s&amp;p 500 and then inside of that I create 11 more lines inside of that that track the different sectors. This lets you see if money is flowing from tech into the utility sector. 

That happened to me early this year. It helped me spot it before it came out in the news! I didn’t shift my money from my tech stocks to utilities because I wanted to hold. But I understood what was going on before most people and didn’t stress it. 

Also the article breaks down why comparing the s&amp;p small, medium and large caps will allow you to see that right now the large and mid cap s&amp;p aren’t undervalued. The s&amp;p 600 small cap is showing me that there may be an opportunity for solid gains.

So I’ve been digging through that and have found some solid companies that I e invested into recently and am looking for some solid gains.

My thought process is, these dividend payments will keep money flowing into my brokerage account and allow me to keep reinforcing my existing positions and opening new ones without having to sell off any positions.

90,investing,actmathsucksballs,2021 has been unprecedented and changed investing forever.. how do you adapt in 2022?,"Although everyone has sort've silently moved on, AMC is still trading steady at $45. (\~500% gain from last year) GameStop is sitting steady at $200. (\~2000% gain). Ethereum is growing rapidly and currently sitting at nearly $4000 (\~2000% gain). The most popular NFT (CryptoPunks) have grown from $4000 last year to roughly $400,000.  That is a roughly 10,000% gain. I think you get the point.

""Value"" stocks like Ford and GM have gone up about 50% in the same time, a fraction of the growth stocks. Similarly, these value plays dropped 40% during the coronavirus crash, roughly the same as all risky assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. 

Which poses the question :: why would anyone buy stocks, especially growth stocks?

Everything Buffett and others eschew has essentially been thrown at the window. Now while one may have been focused on value and long term growth, their returns will have been essentially rooted to their peers who invested in growth. (ironic to call an unproductive asset like crypto ""growth"" but you get the point). So in logical times, you could say ""these are in a bubble and history does not repeat itself to the future."" however, considering the past 5 years crypto is up tremendously with little dips and currently sits at a $900b mc (btc), it could also be another 5 years it goes to $2t before it goes back down. So ""the long run"" point is vague and meritless.

Investing has certainly changed from 100 years ago when Intelligent Investor was written, though obviously many of the principals still apply, how do you adapt?",1630771685,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/phuc4d/2021_has_been_unprecedented_and_changed_investing/
12,investing,azure_420,Question about technical markets infrastructure,"Hi, I'm quite new to trading in general and I'm still learning a lot of stuff as I go on. I had a more technical question, which I'm not completely sure this is the right place to ask, but I figured it's an interesting topic and it's still related to investments and trading, so it may be useful for other people as well.

This being said, my question is about the general market infrastructure, i.e. how do markets work not at an economical level, but on a technical level? Years ago, trading was done using literal pen and paper, nowadays everything is computerized and what I'm really interested in is how the whole system and infrastructure works.

For example, when I buy 1 stock of AAPL using my broker website, what is really going on underneath?  The system is matching my order against a sell order of 1 AAPL stock and making the exchange, right? But what happens if more people do the same thing at the same time? Is there a queue of orders? So is it possible that my order won't be executed if there are no sell orders because they were all already executed against an equal number of buy orders?

So, I hope you got the point of my question, as a TLDR I just want to learn a bit more about how modern online market infrastructures are designed, and would really appreciate if somebody has some resources that explain this topic more in detail. Thanks!",1630762253,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/phrln1/question_about_technical_markets_infrastructure/

As Anthony Robbins says in his book Money master the game, variable annuities are invariably bad.

I held on to my annuities for 13 years so that they would get back to their ore subprime mortgage crash values.  I should have bailed out and cut my losses.  Met Life and the salesman stole 13 years of the future value of my money.

Variable annuities are extremely complex products where you pay through the nose in layered fees.  Snd when you analyze the numbers, it’s a raw deal",1630755225,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/phpwtr/watch_out_for_variable_annuities/
29,investing,Firm_Maintenance2009,"When will the economy return to ""normal""?"," Everywhere I go I see price increases, places state their disributor increased the prices. For example, theres a special toothpaste I use from my local dentist, it used to cost $12, now its $20. The prices of used cars have skyrocketed. The local motorcycle dealers cannot get any stock and I am unable to buy a bike, as everything is sold immedaitley. All used veichles are selling for ridiclous prices. Everything seems disrupted. There are wanted signs everywhere for labor.  


When do you suspect production of goods and services return to normal to meet demand? Do you expect a change in QE or increase in interest rates? Do you suspect the production side of the economy to rebound and meet demand (and when?) to cease the current price gouging and increased costs of goods, or do you suspect this to be the new normal?",1630739669,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/phmwpr/when_will_the_economy_return_to_normal/
31,investing,PmMeClassicMemes,What are the best means of accessing leverage in tax advantaged accounts?,"These accounts vary in restrictions depending on jurisdiction, but essentially the main commonalities are limited ability to position short (long puts only), and no direct access to margin. 

Off the top of my head :

1) Buying deep ITM calls (eg buy a SPY 250 call, it costs approx half of SPY and returns the same dollar change but a larger percentage)

Downsides : often high cost of leverage (like 5% premium to asset value), limited time horizon - if you bought march 2020 spy 250 calls for leverage a year prior you may have lost it all, while stock holders did not see any expiry

2) Buying levered instruments (3x daily etfs)

downsides : volatility drag, liable to blow up in a 2008 style crisis, expense ratio

3) Buying mutual funds or other funds that use leverage on your behalf (eg PSLDX) 

downsides : expense ratio, limited transparency for some, often illiquid and difficult to enter or exit on short time scales

4) Borrowing money (eg line of credit, refinance mortgage) to contribute to your tax advantaged account 

downsides : you can lose more than just your investments(bank can come for your assets), might be screwey with contribution limits to tax advantaged accounts

Are there any other methods i'm missing?  Thoughts on what the best way is? I feel like it's likely deep ITM options. Eg - SPY 150C for Dec 2023 costs ~$30k rn, gives you a notional position of 45k for a leverage ratio of 1.5x.",1630738064,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/phmlde/what_are_the_best_means_of_accessing_leverage_in/

I recently found some shares in a company that belonged to my late grandfather- literally a piece of paper, like how they used to do it in the old days. I'd hate to throw away something valuable on the assumption that they're worthless without checking.

I searched the company name and didn't see anything immediately. They might've gone bust, but **(hopefully)** they were acquired or merged and are still redeemable?

63,investing,Tough-Positive,Casino Stocks Are Sizzling After Fierce Covid Downturn," 

When it comes down to sizing the global online gambling market, “all bets are on.” Grand View Research says it will grow 11.5% to $127.3 billion in 2020-2027, while The Business Research Company predicts an increase of 10.4% to $92.8 million in 2019-2023. With these estimates, gambling stocks –including those of online casinos– are roaring up.

## Online Gambling Growth

It was a tough last couple of years for brick-and-mortar casinos. The American Gaming Association reports that all commercial and tribal casino properties in the U.S. closed during Covid lockdowns, with tiers 1 and 6 operating between 24% and 50% capacity upon returning to operations. 

However, with this reactivation and the technological advances of online betting, the gambling industry is back with a bang and has become one of the fastest-growing businesses on the planet.

According to Insider Monkey, the online gambling market has reached 1.6 billion people, reigniting an industry that has seen a dramatic transformation through new technology. 

Play Today says that at least 80% of Americans gambled in the past year, as users rushed to online casino directories like Canada Casinos to crash the website, looking for some blazing betting fun.

During the pandemic, the business not only grew in size but also witnessed some eye-catching movements in online gambling stocks, with companies like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) soaring after its 2020 IPO.

Also, “MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) launched its mobile betting app BetMGM in partnership with Roar Digital, LLC,” Insider Monkey Reports.

## Stocks On The Rise

This year, 12 states in the U.S. will legalize sports betting spreading the impact to online gambling platforms. With this outlook, the famous site Gambling.com going public under the “GAMB” ticker, with a price per share estimate of 8$ –although down from $11 to $13.

The company controls more than 30 websites in 13 countries, and hit nearly $28 million in revenue in 2020 and $11.5 million in the first quarter this year.

Another attractive stock option within the online gambling market is Penn National Gaming Inc (NASDAQ: PENN), which was mentioned in the second quarter investor letter of Baron Funds.

The letter said: “Following a 232% gain in 2020, the shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. declined 29% in the most recent quarter and are down 13% year-to-date. At its recent price of only $73 (down from a peak price of $136 in March), we believe Penn’s shares are now attractively valued.”

The casino firm is based in Pennsylvania boasting an $11.1 billion market capitalization. “PENN delivered a -17.98% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 32.73%. The stock closed at $70.84 per share on August 13, 2021.”

## Brick-And-Mortar

Amid the economic comeback, brick-and-mortar casinos are also on the way up. According to Truist analyst Barry Jonas gave Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) a Hold rating “and increased its price target from $43 to $38.”

The vaccine rollout is likely to exert a positive effect on these stocks, coupled with the company’s solid earnings and optimistic forecast.

Insider Monkey reports that “In the first quarter of 2021, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) had an EPS of $0.68, short on estimates of $0.85. The company’s net revenue decreased 15.6% or $1.20 billion from the previous quarter.”

As for Caesars Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:CZR), the casino leader saw a solid EPS of $2.03 in the first quarter, up from $1.80. Its revenue during the same period hit $1.7 billion, an increase of 259.2% versus the last year. “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has gained 131% in the past 12 months and 27% year to date.”

67,investing,thri54,A Canadian trust is Likely Accelerating the World's Uranium Shortage.,"There's something funky going on in the Uranium market. On the 17th of August, Uranium prices started climbing, and they've been climbing every day since.  Interestingly, nothing of note around nuclear power has come out since then.  Just rising Uranium prices and analyst upgrades for mining companies.  Feel free to correct me if you know otherwise.

For some background, there's been a perpetual shortage of Uranium production in the world. The total stockpile of uranium has been falling for over a decade straight.  

Coincidentally, the [Sprott Physical Uranium trust launched an at the market equity program on the 17th](https://sprott.com/investor-relations/press-releases/sprott-physical-uranium-trust-launches-at-the-market-equity-program/).  When premiums to NAV get too high, they sell more shares, which they are then obligated to spend any raised capital on acquiring uranium.   

I think that there shelf program is, literally, moving the market.  Uranium is a relatively small and illiquid market.  [Total annual uranium production is in the neighborhood of 130MM pounds.](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/uranium-production-figures.aspx)  Consumption is about 25% higher than that.  Sprott [lists](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/) their uranium stockpile on a daily basis.  As of Thursday the 2nd, they had 21.8MM pounds of Uranium.  Checking the Wayback machine, they had 19.8MM on Wednesday the 25th.  That's an increase of 2 Million pounds in 8 days, or 250,000 lbs per day.  Daily global production is only ~375,000 lbs.  **Sprott's trust has bought 67% of global uranium production over the last week**.  Volumes are accelerating, and it's possible their buying rate will increase going forward.  

I think we could be witnessing the beginnings of a  reflexive process here.  Higher uranium prices will attract more speculators, pouring more capital into the speculative acquisition of uranium needed by utilities, further driving up prices.  

TLDR:  The Sprott Uranium Trust has bought 75% worth of the world's Uranium production over the last week, and judging by the volume, it's accelerating.

President Biden’s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it’s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats’ slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for.

Don’t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year’s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed.

For instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald’s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino’s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).

86,investing,MrIndira,What is the threat of cryptocurrency industry on the financial industry?,"Currently, the cryptocurrency market cap is at 2.292 Trillion USD.   
[source](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

Other people are getting into the game, creating coins and institutions are operating exchanges, where they trade and where people can ""stake."" (where they lend their coins out - to be used in other trades) and earn interest. **Everything is unregulated.**

90% of the trade volume is done through derivatives and options with crypto as the underlying asset.  
These has lead to a lot of price manipulation.

On these exchanges, they use stable coins to make purchases where the price is supposedly pegged 1 USD per stable coin. One in particular, tether, is the most popular stable coin, operating out of the Cayman islands. - completely deregulated. There has been scandal after scandal surrounding this stable coin as it is known they are not pegged 1 USD per stable coin however most of the trade volume is done using tether token. **Tether has a 66.5billion USD market cap and like 14 employees on linkedin... they are responsible for the majority of trading volume in the cryptocurrency space.**  
This one stable coin, there are others with the same issue.

So, FED has got wind of this industry and they are worried about the effect of stable coins on the entire financial industry. Essentially, they have evidence that the stable coins might collapse and trigger runs (massive sell offs or people trying to withdraw their money when the exchanges don't have enough money to pay them out). The industry is now operating on debt (through loans (staking) and exchanges taking major commercial loans to operate) and they have derivatives with multipliers. And it is all unregulated. 

So when the FED tapers and we see a 10% - 20% correction later in the fall. People are saying that will trigger a massive sell off in the entire financial industry. AND because there is an excessive amount of short positions in the financial industry (they're not talking about crypto industry).  Some are saying that it will trigger a bigger correction that 20%. 

Also the federal reserve has introduced crypto legislation in the infrastructure bill designed to tax crypto industry more vehemently. Saying that people (stakers, exchangers and miners) will simply not have the information needed to comply. 

That legislation will be signed hopefully end of September or October 1stish. Crypto enthusiasts claim it will forced many exchange to have to de list and re list. Crypto enthusiasts also say the way the law is written is too vague and so many in the industry will not have the ability to

So my questions are:  


1) How will tapering effect the crypto industry AND how will that affect the non crypto financial industry?

2) How will the financial industry react to the signing of the infrastructure bill?

2) To minimize adverse effects of tapering should tapering be announced before or after the bill is signed?",1630691795,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/phabrs/what_is_the_threat_of_cryptocurrency_industry_on/

Index funds are extremely overvalued because they are too popular. People do not know what actual companies they own shares in, they just expect a crazy 7/8% return in a year. People will realize this, and eventually pull their money out, which could cause a chain reaction of stock prices dropping to the point where the whole economy could collapse. And if people do not realize, they still are subject to very unfortunate consequences if the stock market crashes from other bubbles like the tech bubble. With more people investing now than ever before, a crash could be 10x more brutal with nearly 50% of americans invested (20/30% of that being directly in index funds).

I also think the worst outcome we could see is the collapse of smaller businesses, since an index fund crash/pullout would hurt small businesses that receive a large part of their funding and have most company stock included in index funds. An index fund collapse could put a lot of small businesses out, but big business will survive and get even bigger. From a market analysis point that would say to invest in big business once it crashes, but from a morality stance some of these companies are already way too big (Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc).

After 15 years of banking, 10 of which with a very successful business account earning a few million a year, I was sent a letter stating my account would be closed in 30 days.  

No explanation.

No details

Just a phone number......to an answering machine....that says nobody answers this line and to leave a message.

My branch seemed puzzled.  They called their superiors.  Everyone gave me the same number.  After 4 calls left, someone finally calls me back.  They say they don't have any additional information for me other than a standard ""you no longer fit into our risk assesment tolerance"".  

To add insult to injury, after I happily migrate my accounts to another institution, and add a business account for my new business, they then send the same letter, with the same number, stating my credit card is also going to be closed and I will need to continue to make payments.  They close the account, and my credit immediately goes down 25 points.

Mind you, I have not started laundering money, have not changed my spending habits, maintained a healthy balance, and am not late on any credit card payments....including through the pandemic.  

So beyond the horrific treatment and simply unprofessional disaster that is this banking institution, do I have any legal recourse here?   I realize it might be a bit hollow, but if I am being honest.....I'm willing to dedicate some time and resources to this just to sound the alarm on this behavior and not let them ""get away with it"".

Sadly, it seems I'm a little late to the party because every company I've seen is ridiculously overvalued imo. I'm not usually a stickler for high valuations, but these guys are on another level. 

ZS has a P/S of 61.66, DDOG has 54.21 P/S, NET has a whopping P/S of 72, and CRWD has a whopping 53 P/S and 15 PEG.

The only one I can see that seems relatively okay is PANW with a forward P/E of 63, a P/S of 10, and a PEG of 2.32. not amazing, but I can see how it could outperform.

I know these numbers don't mean everything, and there are other reasons why I believe they are overvalued, but I have never researched an industry that consistently had this high of valuations compared to sales. Yes, some of these guys are growing 100% YoY consistently, but that'll still take years for them to grow into their valuations, assuming their prices stay stagnant until then.

Is this just a symptom of the industry right now, or are there some genuinely good buys in Cybersecurity or data protection that have ground-level valuations?

81,investing,thekidsells,Anybody hedging heavily against a downtown?,"Pretty self explanatory. You may not believe things will go down, and if so it’s not my intention to argue — I’m familiar enough with investing to know value stocks will win if held in the long run and I understand we’re in the greatest bill run in history BUT I can’t help but see breaks in the dam. I’m looking to make money when things go down. 

Mostly concerned with:

1. Exorbitant P/E ratios fueled by aggressive buybacks — inflates stock price without adding any tangible assets to companies 
2. Powell had no room to lower rates, we’re at the bottom, when we go up it will massively affect business lending and many low-margin businesses won’t be able to stay around without massive price increases 
3. Inflation isn’t transitory. Now that money velocity is returning to pre-pandemic levels we are seeing inflation everywhere. It’s not just cars. Unless there’s more lockdowns you restrict spending, you can calculate CPI anyway you want and it will continue to climb 
4. The reverse repo market is super sketchy and more banks are participating

You may not agree with any of this and believe the bull market will continue forever, but I believe we’re back in the pickle faced by Carter and will need to boost interest rates to combat inflation at which point a great majority of small companies will fold — and largely inflated P/E ratios will fall resulting in a catastrophic loss of market cap on Wall Street.

If you think this is possible, or heck even if you don’t, humor me and let me know how you’d invest. I’ve got some shares of FAZ, SPXU, and UVIX because they seem to have blown up when interest rates racheted up in fall of 18 and I expect a similar performance when the fed realizes it can’t print its way out of the PE bubble it’s created.

82,investing,MrIndira,"Why is ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investing seen as ""WOKE"" investing and a scam?","ESG Investing is a relatively new (compared to most other types) of investing strategy.  


Companies that have generated high ESG scores  (when analyzed right) have proven to outperform other companies in their sector **over the long term.** 

The high ESG is essentially a scoring that communicates a company's ability to be more sustainable, environmentally friendly and operate in a more work place friendly culture and so these companies tended to weather economic storms (so to speak) better than their counterparts. Again, over the long term.  


ESG analysis is thorough and when done right is not surface level.    
Therefore, these companies high in ESG Scores have statistically proven to outperform competitors in the long term. Therefore,  the financial incentive is that a high ESG score is associated with decreasing cost of capital.   


So we have ESG Funds popping up, and Asset management firms are hiring ESG Analysts - Governing bodies and other public entities as well etc. etc.  


So why do so many consider ESG ""a scam"" or ""woke"" investing? Is it because it introduces a class system in the public equity space that they consider themselves to be lesser in?",1630607653,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pgnt9w/why_is_esg_environmental_social_and_governance/

I have shared write-ups on this specific stock many times on other subreddits, My initial position was taken back in April, with many purchases since then.

Edited down from a **SeekingAlpha** article for brevity's sake. Full article is very detailed and a recommend to read fully.

**Short term Risks:**

HC Approval. In the short term, it’s all that matters effectively. This company has many opportunities not discussed here, so the long term view is quite bright. In other words, the face mask and PPE market opportunity is a launch pad for the even larger opportunities that will come later. Thus, if HC approval does not come through-

(more questions that delay things beyond, let’s say a month or 2, or worse, an outright rejection – neither of which is expected, but can't be known with regulators until it becomes public, which is why getting approval is a MAJOR de-risking event for the company)

\-then expect the stock to have a rough time of it. On the other hand, if they get approval... This company is in what Stan Druckenmiller has described as “Inning 1.” If for some reason, HC does not grant approval and bless it as anti-viral and biocidal, but leaves the door open, then the stock steps back and it will be Stan’s Inning 0, as long as HC ultimately grants approval.

**Investment Thesis:**

***ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.*** **(OTCPK:ZENYF) (ZEN.V)** has a major catalyst ahead of it with the decision of Health Canada as to the safety and efficacy of its game-changing biocidal, anti-viral and anti-microbial AgGO-2 mask coating.

Risks are in favor of approval, which would be a major de-risking event, causing a rapid and significant (roughly 100%+) re-rating of the stock. For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.

The business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a ""must own"" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.

**An IP Play on an Innovative Nano-Material, Not a Mining Company:**

ZEN was a mining company. It is now an IP nano materials play (“graphene-enhanced” technology). The company recently announced it is asking shareholders to approve a change to their industry status with the stock market and that it will seek to move to a bigger exchange, hopefully in the US. The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won’t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.

**Three Initial Target Markets:**

*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*

1. Personal Protective Equipment (""PPE,"" e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),
2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and
3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let’s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

ZEN’s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.

The next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company’s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN’s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.

**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**

This is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That’s when things are “normal” (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.

There are over 6,000 hospitals.

There are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.

There are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.

And all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.

**Detection and Sensors:**

The company’s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.

Imagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.

Please see the company’s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.

**Therapeutics:**

Down the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won’t cost much to pursue in the short term, I’ll address them at a later time.

**The Model:**

The company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in “masks equivalent” (“me”). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.

**Margins:**

Assuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we’re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.

**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.

**Expenses:**

Expect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&amp;tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they’re hiring at least a few heads.

For the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they’ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.

**Capex:**

Assume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.

Obviously, since they’re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.

Let’s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they’re selling out the 25M mpd. That’s:

25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue

x 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)

x 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)

= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)

(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)

**Balance Sheet:**

With $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn’t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company’s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.

I’m okay with that: a company that doesn’t need to raise money won’t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don’t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.

If they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you’ll see it’s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.

**Misc:**

Lock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).

**Insider Buying:**

The CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.

**Summary:**

* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing “must have” products, rather than “nice to have” ones.
* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.
* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.
* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.
* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years.",1630603091,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pgmbpw/zen_graphene_with_paradigm_changing_applications/
97,investing,investing-scientist2,Six attractive stocks IMHO (AAPL AVGO CMCSA CRAI CVS JNJ). What do you think?,"Here is a couple of stocks that might be worth your attention this week. They were selected using a couple of criteria - most of them heavily rely an the company's fundamentals; the analysts recommendations are only provided as a kind of support for the hand-picked names. This is why I’m calling the approach a **consensus strategy.** 

The stocks I’m going to present you below are generally believed to outperform the stock market in the coming months, they have a consensus recommendation of Buy, their fundamentals are scored considerably better than most stocks and their average target price by stock analysts is above current market valuation.

* **TheStreet score**: A+, A or A-
* **Zacks Rank**: 1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold)
* **Weiss Ratings recommendation**: A or B
* **Yahoo Finance recommendation**: at least mixed Buy/Hold
* **Yahoo Finance target price**: min. 5% higher than current price

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *– The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication — not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500’s +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

I hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.

11,investing,cbus20122,Heavily indebted Chinese developer Evergrande warns of default risk,"[**Read the full article here**](https://www.ft.com/content/e870dd10-223c-411e-9e72-53c3b8e609b6)  


&gt;Evergrande has warned it risks defaulting on its debt if it fails to raise cash, as China’s most heavily indebted property developer battles to stave off an unfolding liquidity crisis.  The unusually stark wording from the company came in an interim earnings statement on Tuesday that confirmed a profit warning issued last week and outlined a series of measures to shore up its finances that include selling properties.    
&gt;  
&gt;“The group has risks of defaults on borrowings and cases of litigation outside of its normal course of business,” Evergrande said, adding that it would pursue further asset sales, control costs and seek to attract new investors.  The warning comes as Evergrande experiences the worst upheaval in its history, with a stream of recent problems raising questions over its access to financing, forcing it to sell assets and earning it an unusual public rebuke from the government over its debt risks.... 

I'm sharing this because ***if*** this were to default, it could be a trigger for some much larger market turmoil. Evergrande represents potential systemic risk both in China as well as the global financial markets. IE, this defaulting ***could*** be a bit of a Lehman-esque type moment.

With that out of the way, I want to be very clear - **this is NOT likely to default** since the strong likelihood is that it will get a bailout due to the system wide risk attached to it for China. 

With that being said, history has a lot of examples of policy mistakes, or attempts to control asset bubbles that simply end up popping the bubble. I stated this a few months ago, but the current attempt from Chinese policymakers to control debt and reduce economic risk is a tightrope walk, and there are legitimate risks of overtightening. With that said, China has a LOT of control over all the levers in their financial system, so if any country would be able to stop a cascade, it's likely China.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Note:** Please at least try to refrain from making this into an ideological or political debate about China.  Given, sometimes these things merge into the financial realm of discussion, but at least try to take a neutral view of this.",1630590878,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pgictj/heavily_indebted_chinese_developer_evergrande/

Let's say there is a particular stock worth 100$.

Now there are some conditions that lead investors to lose credibility in this stock. First buy order is down to 90$.

If an investor with shares have a stop-loss order at 95$ and another one has it at 90$, which one would be executed earlier?

Imvestor 1 because he has 'waited longer' for a buy order or investor 2 because he has perfectly matched the price set by the buyer?

Chargepoint reported a second-quarter loss of $84.9 million, or 29 cents a share, after reporting a loss of $35.3 million a year ago. Sales increased to $56.1 million from $35 million a year prior, with more than $40 million credited to its networked charging systems.

With the sales beat, executives increased their annual guidance to sales of $225 million to $235 million, after previously stating a target of $195 million to $205 million.

20,investing,3STmotivation,The biggest catalyst in recent history is showing results for the uranium sector,"Since I started posting on uranium last year, a lot has happened in the sector and we have seen equities increase multiples across the board. There have been plenty of catalysts that have spurred on this move, including reactor life extensions, COVID mine disruptions, new reactor buildouts, capital flows, shut down of supply and several more. A new catalyst has entered this market in recent weeks however and has had an immediate positive effect on the sector. This catalyst was Sprott taking over uranium participation corporation and converting it into the Sprott uranium trust. After everything was said and done, they implemented their USD $300 million ATM and went to work putting in a front curve bid for physical uranium (an oversimplification to be fair, but I want to keep this post short and to the point as to not stray too far off of the main point).

And putting in a bid they did, surprising perhaps even the most bullish expectations, as they went on to add approximately 2,7 million pounds of uranium in just 2 weeks and they are showing no signs of stopping at this point. To give you all some context, that 2,7 million pounds is roughly equivalent to the annual fuel needs of 6 standard 1GW reactors. There was already a firm supply/demand gap in place that formed that basis for this uranium bull thesis and Sprott will widen this gap even further in the months ahead. This will likely accelerate if they can acquire a NYSE listing in Q1 or Q2 of next year, opening the door to additional capital that wants to participate in this bull market via a liquid and well managed vehicle, causing the purchasing of additional pounds in the process.

This trust is an absolute game changer for the sector, as it provides the market with something it has not really seen in this magnitude before, with a consistent bidder in the uranium spot market that can really ramp up the price of physical uranium. Equities will follow this rise and there is no saying what this trust could achieve for the sector once it gets fully up and going. There is also still plenty of time for it to achieve that ramp up, as the price of uranium still needs to rise by roughly another 80% at least to incentivize enough new production for some form of breakeven across the market. However, that break even appears to not be enough to fix the current and upcoming supply/demand gap and an overshoot in price is looking more likely by the day given prevailing circumstances.

There are a lot of moving parts to this vehicle and I have been working hard to put the puzzle together and this post is merely a short summarized version of that work, but I can firmly say that this is the catalyst that has the potential to supercharge what was already a very compelling investment case. I will be watching the developments closely and the coming 2-4 years have never looked as bullish for this sector in my opinion. Should you have any questions regarding this development or uranium in general, please let me know below or via a message and I will be glad to help out. Thank you for reading, please always make sure to do your own due diligence as well and I hope you all have a good and healthy rest of your day.",1630587324,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pghbha/the_biggest_catalyst_in_recent_history_is_showing/

I love love love cybersecurity stocks, think they are in an underdeveloped sector that has plenty of challenges that will be addressed by many of the stocks like CRWD, FTNT, PANW, etc in the future

HOWEVER

I am most concerned out of any sector of stocks in the cybersecurity space when tapering begins or starts to become a real issue (in maybe 4-6 months?). To me, these stocks which are both tech and growth in a space that is still so under defined is going to suffer the most from taper more than tech names that have proven reliable for years and years, and bc the sector has easily done the best out of any ""growth"" stock in the past year or so.

What do people make of this? As much as I'd love to go totally all in on them ASAP, with tapering at some point going to rear it's ugly head probably in a few months, I'm not quite sure.",1630558679,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pgb2w7/who_else_is_concerned_about_cybersecurity_stocks/

52,investing,InvestedInvester,Deep thinkings to think about with all my deep thinkers,"I have a proposal for my fellow MVST investors

First things first, if we want our money to stretch we have to think outside the box 
 Although I do believe in this company, I would like to help Microvast gain traction in the EV battery industry. In order for me to do that I need to make sure we’re all on the same page. Microvast does make me wet, but not wet enough. You know what would make me wet enough ? If we could dispose of the people spreading false information/ their worthless opinions. It is affecting the community as a whole and it’s rusting our tracks. 
THE INTRODUCTORY SOLUTION  
First we need to somehow contact Jimmy Neutron, I’ve been studying his work for years and he is extremely knowledgeable. Some of his in inventions include ‘but are not limited to’ 
Gravitrax SK30,
Burp powered jet pack ,
Spoofinator 3000,
ION Ray,
And my personal favorite, Laser Sword

SOLUTION
Long story short, contact Mr.Neutron about the mass manufacturing of thicker electrodes (that preform well) with aqueous processing. As this will ultimately lower battery cost. A lower cost of battery’s will help enable widespread adoption of our company, which will lead to higher earnings, which will then lead to our stock increasing in value, which will lead to more money in our pockets. 
Thank you for your time, and good luck on this meaningless journey we refer to as “life”.

The section titled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below.

Financial Outlook:

Okta's financial outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022 includes the expected contribution from the acquisition of Auth0, net of purchase accounting adjustments. The acquisition closed on May 3, 2021.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company expects:

Total revenue of $325 million to $327 million, representing a growth rate of 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $35 million to $34 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.25 to $0.24, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million.

For the full year fiscal 2022, the Company now expects:

Total revenue of $1.243 billion to $1.250 billion, representing a growth rate of 49% to 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million to $114 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.77 to $0.74, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 147 million.

These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

Okta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of Okta’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not available without unreasonable effort.

Conference Call Information:

Okta will host a live video webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 1, 2021 to discuss the results and outlook. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company’s website at investor.okta.com prior to the conference call. The live video webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Supplemental Financial and Other Information:

Supplemental financial and other information can be accessed through the Company’s investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.

Okta believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by the Company's management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.

Okta encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.",1630527595,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pg26gz/okta_announces_strong_second_quarter_results/
89,investing,tommygunz007,Gambling issue: when to take profits on options.,"I bought a single option for a company called ZH and well I stink at options. All last week it was in the red, like really really in the red, and today I am in the green and up 10% on what I paid. I paid $285 it's now up $35. I have two more days to go, and most Fridays stocks go into the red to burn options holders.

My gambling question is this:

Do you cash out at 10% or do you 'let it ride' if you have a few days to go? It would seem if I always cashed out winning options at 10% I probably would have more wins, but also potentially leave cash on the table.

Updated coverage: Did 22nd Century (XXII) Made a Good Choice Bringing the Hop Plant into Its Family of Plants to Modify

Will the FDA Give Traction to Their VLN Cigarettes Soon?

Good day everyone,

We are continuing coverage on 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII), a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.

Current price $3.3/share (at 10:00 AM EDT)

After closing at $3.57/share in the Tuesday session, XXII shares began looking for a level of support in early trading today. I believe a support level at $3.30/share will bring buyers in and we will see increasing volume and price throughout the day.

Remember, tobacco is still the flagship product at XXII and generates their revenues. For the FDA, the decisions on Juul and other manufacturers could represent a milestone as it tries to execute an ambitious tobacco regulation agenda. The FDA in April said it was taking steps to ban menthol cigarettes. And it continues to work on a potential requirement that nicotine levels in cigarettes be set at minimally addictive levels, a possible game-changer that the White House would need to approve. It’s possible XXII may see a mandate and approval announced together.

The hop plant market is not as highly regulated as tobacco or hemp/cannabis, providing a faster path to commercialization. If you have followed XXII you know they have been waiting a while for the FDA to approve their ability to advertise their VLN cigarettes as a safer alternative to standard tobacco. We all know that cannabis remains classified as a schedule one drug by the US government.

Hop and hemp/cannabis plants have many similarities. Both are part of the Cannabaceae family of alkaloid flowering plants and the active ingredients found in both plants offer potential health benefits for managing anxiety, inducing calm, addressing sleeping disorders and resolving stomach problems, among other wellness applications.

The fact that hop, and cannabis plants are similar is important because XXII has already done a lot of R&amp;D, including that done by its cannabis partner companies, that may apply to hop plants creating new proprietary plants. Let’s remember that XXII has valuable plant modification IP and know-how including utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other technology they have developed in tobacco and cannabis.

The hop plant has been grown and used to make beer for centuries (possibly millennia) without modification. XXII has picked a plant to be the third leg in in its plant modification tripod that is ready to be improved and expanded.

original report below

TL,DR - 22nd Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops

Massive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants. **Now hops also?** I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.

Good day everyone,

Coverage on **22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),** a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.

Current price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)

On August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.

When I look at [the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today’s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are **approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.

I often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company’s success. Insider ownership isn’t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares. **Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company’s shares.** Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.

When we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company’s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it’s infancy. XXII doesn’t chase small markets.

In a [letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html) published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said “I am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise – the global **specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.”

95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.

XXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.

XXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.

7/23/2021 Cowen Initiated Coverage Outperform $5.00

**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA’s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company’s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN® King and VLN® Menthol King, including the headline claim of “95% less nicotine.” VLN® tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.

**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century’s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).

The XXII “trifecta” of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an **estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each **1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.

Stay tuned for more of our coverage on 22nd Century Group coming very soon.

**Much more DD coming including FDA and mandated lower nicotine by the Biden administration**

About 22nd Century Group, Inc.22nd Century Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: XXII) is a leading plant biotechnology and intellectual property company focused on improving health and wellness through plant science. 22nd Century uses modern plant breeding technologies, gene-editing, and molecular breeding to deliver value to its customers in the life science and consumer products industries by creating new, proprietary tobacco, hemp/cannabis and hop plants with optimized alkaloid and flavonoid profiles as well as improved yields and valuable agronomic traits. 22nd Century was founded to build intellectual property related to nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant and to commercialize its proprietary reduced nicotine content (RNC) tobacco plants, which have become the cornerstone of FDA’s comprehensive plan to address the enormous amount of death and disease caused by addiction to smoking. **The Company has also begun to leverage its plant science expertise and existing partnerships to create and commercialize new, proprietary hemp/cannabis and hop plants to optimize their genetics and create valuable new intellectual property.**

In an SEC filing, Cathie Wood's shop outlines the fund, which looks to be at least 80% invested in stocks in its benchmark Transparency Index, published by Solactive.

""Companies operating in the following industries, as determined by the Index provider, are excluded from the Index: (i) alcohol, (ii) banking, (iii) chemicals, (iv) confectionary, (v) fossil fuel transportation, (vi) gambling, (vii) metals, (viii) mineral, (ix) natural gas, (x) oil, and (xi) tobacco,"" ARK says in its filing.

If approved, the ETF would be the second that Ark has launched this year. In March, the company started a fund focused on space-related investments, which has risen about 4% since its debut and now has more than $600 million in assets. Meanwhile, the firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up to $22.5 billion, although it’s down 2% year-to-date -- compared with a gain of more than 20% for the S&amp;P 500.",1630500205,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pft42l/cathie_woods_ark_files_for_new_transparency_etf/

In particular, competitors amongst the various crypto technologies serve as a great example of how fickle capital and liquidity inflows and outflows are, and that generally speaking, capital will flow to where it can be put to the most efficient use in producing value for the world, because that generally reflects the highest returns.

However, because I used some no-no words that these mods can't possibly wrap their heads around, you all will not see this. Now, do I think that my post had a ton of value, no, I don't think that highly of myself. But, perhaps someone else came here with much more experience and wisdom to share about these technologies, but couldn't because these mods only will unban their naughty words when they think that it's ""safe"" for you to see it.

It wasn't too long ago that the most prominent crypto markets were trading at less than $100, and back then, those were considered no-no words to these mods.

They changed their minds recently, but only after it priced out the vast majority of participants here. Why did they change their mind? Why do they need to censor a market which clearly has staying power, yet they're fine with spacs? Why do they think they're entitled to censoring the defacto investing subreddit from an up and coming market?

I’m 34, have 3 kids, wife doesn’t work, and I am fortunate enough to own a rental property with no mortgage.  I net about $1250/month after HOA, taxes, insurance etc. that doesn’t include unexpected expenses like fixing the AC or dishwasher etc. 

Currently, I really like the cash flow from the rental because it helps cover our own expenses like day care and mortgage on our house. 

But I’m wondering if it might be smarter to just sell the rental and put everything into SPY or something and hope to see it grow. 

If I were to sell the rental today I could probably get about $275k, and then subtract 6% realtor fees and also 20% of 50k in capital gains (bought for 225k about 4 years ago). So lets say I come out of it with 250k (if I did the math right). Would I be better off taking the 250k and putting into the market to let it cook for 20 years, occasionally pulling from it when I need it or is it better to keep the rental, invest some the income and then watch the equity on the house grow over time?

I would love to hear if anyone has similar experiences or is good at running a comparison model.

I think the end game is I would be most inclined to do whatever provides the most long term growth versus short term advantages.

**Disclaimer:** **I'm simply condensing some thoughts I've had on payment for order flow (PFOF). I'm just a casual observer, and this is the internet. For all you know everything I'm about to say is complete BS.**

Payment for order flow =/= front running (which is already illegal). Nothing I have seen or experienced leads me to believe that PFOF screws over retail investors in any meaningful way.

Might you get better fills if you use a brokerage that doesn't participate in PFOF? Sure. Does it matter? No, at least not for the vast majority of retail investors. If you're in that *tiny* (probably non-existent) minority where your bottleneck to greater profits is fill quality, then you probably wouldn't consider yourself an investor, and probably aren't reading this post.

Think about it: If you bought AAPL a month ago, does it really matter that your order *technically* might not have filled at the best possible price? What if you only DCA into SPY? If you were gambling in penny stocks or options having no idea what you were doing, is PFOF the deciding factor of your P/L? No. Isn't it great that we can do all of these things without worrying about paying commissions? I think so.

Even if you *could* get better price improvement from a broker not participating in PFOF, you're still never going to do worse than the [NBBO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp).

It used to not be very clear to me *why* market makers are willing to pay so much for retail order flow. Then I read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxbzcx3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxcfrlc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from someone who implies they are a market maker, and the light bulb went on. Here are the highlights:

&gt;...  
we literally buy up your order flow and make pretty good money off of it because you guys genuinely have no clue what you're doing  
...  
in aggregate your orders are effectively random noise that we can trade against to make a small spread  
...  
If I'm market making, I'm putting a bid at price B, and an ask at price B + S for some S &gt; 0. I am hoping that someone will sell to me at price B and buy from me at price B + S, so that my profit on such a pair of transactions will be S, the spread.  
...  
So anyways one guy, Joe, has his fancy indicator X signal to buy stock XYZ and shortly thereafter another gal, Jane has her fancy indicator Y signal to sell stock XYZ. The ad-hoc nature of many of these ""indicators"" is that most of them will not be correlated with one another and in aggregate will mostly average out to some fraction of S.  
...  
So if I know that there's a group of unsophisticated traders on stock XYZ, I want to trade against them in aggregate compared to trading against a sophisticated trader who may actually know what they're doing.  
...  
The remaining risk in the above strategy is that XYZ can have actual legitimate signals such as news that causes the price to swing heavily in one direction or another, so usually when market making you find a basket of stocks that are delta neutral.

This makes the most sense out of anything I've ever read about PFOF.

If I'm a market maker and it's *literally my job* to be transacting in the market *all day every day*, and my goal is to make money from the bid/ask spread, I don't want to be exposed to any other source of P/L. The best I can hope for is to take opposing trades to as many orders as possible whose P/L will average out to 0. I'll make the spread times however many round trip trades that I've taken.

Now let's look at front running.

Here's what FINRA says about front running ([rule 5270](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/5270)):

&gt;No member or person associated with a member shall cause to be executed an order to buy or sell a security or a related financial instrument when such member or person associated with a member causing such order to be executed has material, non-public market information concerning an imminent block transaction in that security, a related financial instrument or a security underlying the related financial instrument prior to the time information concerning the block transaction has been made publicly available or has otherwise become stale or obsolete.

English translation ([source](https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/f4-433/mccann1.htm#:~:text=Front%2Drunning%20occurs%20when%20portfolio,same%20securities%20for%20their%20clients)):

&gt;Front-running occurs when portfolio managers buy securities in their personal accounts prior to buying the same securities for their clients, or when the managers sell securities out of their personal accounts prior to selling the same securities for their clients.

If I want to make money by front running, I want to see a lot of large, one-sided orders, and get in on *the same side* as those orders before they're executed (remember a market maker will always take the *opposite* side). When they go through, and the market moves to that side, I'll make money.

It seems like a bad idea to try and front run retail flow, given its smaller average order size and uncorrelated nature. Retail flow probably won't be moving markets in most cases.

Obviously the GME/meme stock situation might be different, but maybe not. Here is an interesting point that was made in [a thread](https://www.nuclearphynance.com/Show%20Post.aspx?PostIDKey=200252&amp;PageIndex=2) on NuclearPhynance:

&gt;I can't speak for GME, but in similar conditions, you'd really be surprised just how non-toxic the order flow turns out to be. Especially on a short-term basis. A lot of the real flow winds up being near random and totally insensitive to the spread, unaware of its own impact, and uncorrelated with microstructure alpha. Obviously, that's all great for market makers.

82,investing,Yu-piter,Anyone excited for Paytm IPO? (i.e. largest payment processor in India aka India's paypal),"India is probably a country that is under-invested in, and probably for good reason, but Paytm, which Berkshire Hathaway, Softbank, and Alibaba have large stakes in, is the most promising IPO I have seen. 

It competes with many companies but has large, 65%-70%, marketshare. The company is doing I believe $500 million in revenue this year and hoping to double that by 2023. It's in a region that has staggering payments growth; huge, not comprobable to the US right now, and I'm thinking where china was a few years ago.

I'm hoping the IPO doesn't get too big; and it may not since IPO market has been that crazy last few months compared to other times. The company projects $25-$30 billion ipo. That's an okay deal; not great but not terrible. If it's $50 billion+ then it may go the way of Facebook or flat-line for a few years.  it's anything like Paypal, or Square however, and all signs point to it being something similar yes, then an invstor can reap huge returns over 10-15 years if shares can be picked up in the $20 billion range.",1630394358,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pf0wwa/anyone_excited_for_paytm_ipo_ie_largest_payment/
89,investing,Zannierer,How to long-term invest in a weakly inefficient market with no sign of random walk?,"From many beginners books recommended on this site (Bogleheads, Random walk down Wall Street, The Four Pillars of Investing), the argument for long-term index investing lies on the assumption that the market is efficient and the stock price characteristic is that of a random walk. What would happen then, if that wasn't the case anymore, as in many frontier markets? Does long-term investment in stock still makes sense? Is index ETF still a good choice when the extra TER in active funds eats up the larger return? Or it's better to find less volatile forms of investment? How can it be that the large cap index is weakly efficient and shows signs of random walk, while the rest of the market isn't?

For context, in Vietnam - a frontier market, saving interest has for the first time dip below the average index return of the last decade and current corporate bond rate. The stock market trading volume has doubled in less than 2 years, with a huge influx of new, inexperienced investors and is on the second largest rally in the mere 20 years of its existence.",1630385740,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pez3qm/how_to_longterm_invest_in_a_weakly_inefficient/

By creating and then selling a token that represents this copyrightable asset, investors can participate in the benefits. The investors can also gain from price appreciation should the asset become more valuable or sell it for a profit.

In the case of crypto-collectibles, the crypto-collectible asset represents the asset that is owned by the company. This is a new type of asset that has not been seen before. In this case, the investor is buying ownership in the company and the asset represents a portion of that ownership.

Note- The results do not indicate if the companies drug was approved or denied. Only the move after the date.

TLDR:

The average 24hr change in a stock price after the announcement was: -2.8%

The average 1 week change in a stock price after the announcement was: -6.7%

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those that are not familiar with what a PDUFA date is (from Google):

The PDUFA date refers to **the date the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are expected to deliver their decision whether or not a approve a companies New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA)**

Methodology: The PDUFA/PDUFA Priority review date was found then the stock price was pulled using GOOGLEFINANCE in sheets. From there a % change calculation was made on the 24hr price change and 1 week change. All biotech stocks that had a PDUFA/PDUFA Priority review date from 1/1/21 - 8/23/21 were analyzed and an average was taken. Any outliers are highlighted in either green or red.

Red represents a change of more than -2%

Green represents a change of more than +2%

Over the past few months I’ve been trying to learn how to make evaluations on my own to find companies I believe to be undervalued. My process has been to look at a company’s market cap. And to compare it to its annual revenue and growth. I also add the total assets of the company and compare that figure to market cap. To see if I believe the current share price is attractive. If the company’s market cap is close to the annual revenue + assets and the growth looks like it could push the company beyond its current market cap, I invest.

These are pretty easy stats to pull up and understand so I’m asking for advice from more seasoned investors on how I should evaluate a company and if my evaluation method even makes sense as I could be totally missing something as a few months ago I didn’t even know what market cap meant.

35,investing,MidKnight148,Ideas To Calculate Valuation for Crypto?,"I saw an article on Yahoo Finance the other day about an analyst's call for Ethereum to hit $10,000 by the end of 2021, link below, and it reminded me a question I've had for a long time: how are price targets calculated for crypto currencies? As far as I'm concerned, 100% of the values of crypto currencies is speculation (as opposed to intrinsic value) and price changes just depend on social sentiment, so are crypto price targets just ""intuition,"" or is there anything more to it?

Conversely, when analysts calculate a price target for a stock, they have several tools at their disposal: there are relative valuation methods, dividend discount models, free cash flow models, residual income models, etc. And sure, each of those tools do require some guessing and assumptions, but analysts are tasked with doing enough business research that they can make the best educated guess they can under a certain confidence interval. And that's not to say that every analyst does their job well or honestly, but good analysts do try to make confident price target calls using the tools mentioned above. Is there anything like that for crypto? And if so, what?

Few  companies benefited more during the pandemic and few have a bigger cloud  of uncertainty hanging over them as investors try to figure out what  the future holds.*

*Fulgent has a growing* [*genetic testing business*](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/healthcare/genomics-stocks/genetic-testing-stocks/)  *for pediatric diseases, which management expects to generate revenue of  $110 million in 2021, representing a 201% year-over-year increase.  That’s a growth story investors should be following.*

*Fulgent  bought CSI Laboratories for its oncology testing and molecular  diagnostics, made a $20 million investment in Helio Health for early  cancer detection, and increased its $19 million majority stake in  Chinese joint venture FF Gene Biotech for cancer testing in China.*

*The  potential for multi-cancer screening is mind boggling — in both  financial and human terms. Based on a single liquid biopsy (blood test),  multi-cancer screening can detect dozens of early-stage cancers before  they spread and become harder to treat. Pharma companies are advocating  and paying for genetic cancer screening since it improves the outcomes  and will drive demand for their therapies.*

*Fulgent has proven to be a very capable operator generating* [*operating margin*](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/operating-margin/)  *above 60% and ending Q2 with $777 million in cash on its balance sheet.

### Methodology

For each stock from NASDAQ and NYSE scores are calculated for each of the following areas:

* Valuation
* Profitability
* Growth
* Health

The scores are calculated using the indicators shown in colored boxes  above. For instance, to assess stocks profitability, Return on Assets (**ROA**), Return on Equity (**ROE**) and **Net Margin**  are taken into account. The algorithm looks up the value of ROA in  every stock belonging to the same industry and compares it against the  analyzed stock, providing a final rank: if there are 20 stocks and 5 of  them have higher ROA, then the ROA-associated score is (20-5)/20 \* 100 =  75, meaning that the ROA is better than in 75% of stocks. We want ROA  to be higher than in the other companies; sometimes, however, we want to  be lower than in peers, as is the case with Price to Book ratio (**P/B**).  Then, the mean score across ROA, ROE and Net Margin is calculated.  Similar with Valuation, Growth and Health scores. The algorithm starts  with Valuation score, requiring it is at least 50/100. Then it proceeds  with Profitability, Growts and Healts scores, each time requiring the  score to be 50 or higher. Finally, for the remaining stocks the mean  value across all four areas of interest are calculated. Only highest  ranking stocks are the ones of interest and subjected to further manual  inspection.

As far as I'm concerned, 100% of the values of crypto currencies is speculation (as opposed to intrinsic value) and price changes just depend on social sentiment, so are crypto price targets just ""intuition,"" or is there anything more to it?

Conversely, when analysts calculate a price target for a stock, they have several tools at their disposal: there are relative valuation methods, dividend discount models, free cash flow models, residual income models, etc. And sure, each of those tools do require some guessing and assumptions, but analysts are tasked with doing enough business research that they can make the best educated guess they can under a certain confidence interval. And that's not to say that every analyst does their job well or honestly, but good analysts do try to make confident price target calls using the tools mentioned above. Is there anything like that for crypto?

72,investing,yldf,Somewhat crash-resilient asset classes,"I'm looking for diversification of my portfolio to be somewhat resilient w.r.t. crashes. As usual, I'm writing a bit of a preface before coming to the point.

As probably most investors are, I'm currently mainly invested in stocks, mostly several ETFs. I'm planning to rebalance soon, so I'm re-thinking how exactly. I'm -- compared to most recommendations -- currently a bit heavy on US stocks because it went so well in the last years so the position is larger than it was. I'm a bit heavy on Europe, but that's kind of on principle since I'm located there and like to be a bit Europe-heavy, and I'm certainly too low on rest of the world and Emerging Markets. I have a little bit in Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds, but that's not too much.

Now, everyone will agree at some point there will be a crash. So do I, but as everybody who is honest to themselves I have no idea when. Could be tomorrow, could be some point in the next year, could be in a couple years, could be in 10 years. I simply don't know, I'm not a fortune teller. If I knew when a crash will happen things would be very easy: Sell everything, go short, and buy again after the crash.

But what I do know is that when there is a crash, it's good to have some money to buy. I could set aside some war chest in cash and just wait. But that money will be slowly eaten by inflation and certainly not increase in value.

If I were to invest some of the money in other asset classes other than stocks, ideally some which would not go down the same as stocks in a stock market crash, I could gain some value, and when the crash comes just rebalance the extra cash I have there to stocks after the crash for added benefit.

If you think about it, that's diversification across asset classes. I've read a bit on Google what people recommend there, and here's a breakdown of possibilities, and my opinion on them:

* Government bonds (US and the stable European ones). The good news is they are not so correlated to the stock market. In fact, for the 2007/2008 crash, they've done very well. For the 2020 crash, they fell rapidly as well, although not as much as the stock market. They give some interest, but it's certainly very limited. Seems a bit better than just holding the cash, but not much. Also, if I'm investing in US government bonds (which pay better interest than e.g. German bonds) I have the currency risk. I could hedge that, but that would cost a bit of the meagre profit...
* Commodities/precious metals. I don't get that one. I understand that some of them might go up in a crash. But they don't generate any interest by themselves, it's pure speculation. An ounce of gold is just the same ounce of gold in 10 years. Under a lot of assumptions I could say that it might be a hedge against inflation and thus better than holding cash. But it's nothing that will provide any returns beyond inflation by just passively investing.
* Real Estate (direct investment). It's a shitload of work, it's very risky since it's hard to diversify unless you have a lot of cash to invest there. I don't want that.
* Real Estate (through REITs or Real Estate stocks/ETFs). Much easier to realize, but questionable how much it helps with diversification. The Real Estate ETFs all went down pretty much the same as the stock market last year, and while not many of them existed, the 2007/2008 crash was caused by real estate, so I don't expect this to have been very resilient (but I'm looking into whether the problem here is that weighting by market-cap might be a bad idea here...). This might be an asset class a bit more robust than the overall market, but I am skeptical. On top of that, I'm shocked about the dividend rates here, I expected a lot of them to be much higher. Adding a bit of that is likely fine.
* Tune weighting of industries/regions based on their performance in the last years. With that, I mean thoughts like: US stock market went extremely well the last years, so if there should be a crash, it has the biggest possibility to fail -&gt; have less US. Consumer Staples and Energy did worse than the market the recent years -&gt; more of those, since they won't fall as much in a crash. Tech stocks went exceptionally well, so they have the most potential to fall -&gt; less of those. This will mitigate the risk (although I'm skeptical on the Energy part), I guess, but also limit growth for the current market situation.
* Cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly high correlation to the stock market if I look at the charts. They crashed last year. Also, they're pretty high right now and their intrinsic value is a bit questionable. I'm not completely against investing a small portion of my portfolio there, but I'm not overly convinced of this. If they had a clear negative correlation, it would show that they are regarded as an alternative when the traditional market fails. But I can't see that being the case right now.
* P2P lending. I'm skeptical. It's completely unregulated, so there's counterparty risk. It's hyped a lot by influencers, which rings alarm bells. And if I look at bondora, which seems to have shifted the focus to their ""Gain&amp;Grow"" product, that gives 6.75% per year, but has a 1% withdrawal fee and a 400 EUR maximum investment per month, this looks fishy. This industry also had trouble last year, with withdrawal restrictions and higher default rates, so its resilience in crashes is also questionable. It's its own asset class, but lack of transparency and regulation make me be very hesitant here.

Chinese regulators on Monday slashed the amount of time players under the age of 18 can spend on online games to an hour of gameplay on Fridays, weekends and holidays, in response to growing concern over gaming addiction, state media reported.

The rules, published by the National Press and Publication Administration, said users under the age of 18 would be able to play games only from 8pm to 9pm local time on those days, according to the Xinhua news agency.

Online gaming companies would be barred from providing gaming services to minors in any form outside those hours and would need to ensure they had put real name verification systems in place, said the regulator, which oversees the country’s video games market.

Previously, China limited the total length of time minors could access online games to three hours on holiday or 1.5 hours on other days.

The new rules come amid a broad crackdown by Beijing on China’s tech giants, such as Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, which has unnerved investors, hammering Chinese shares traded at home and abroad.

The National Press and Publication Administration also told Xinhua it would increase the frequency and intensity of inspections for online gaming companies to ensure they were putting in place time limits and anti-addiction systems.",1630326694,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/peh5er/more_crackdown_by_the_ccp_on_video_games_minors/
80,investing,natery5,Pay off loan and lose liquidity vs keep trading until the same amount is made?,"Here it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade:

- $20k
- $10k
- $6k from my girlfriend
- $4k from credit cards
- some savings from my regular job

The reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing. At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.

When GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.

Since that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.

Bottom line: I extinguished my $10k loan, and I'm constantly re-financing my credit cards with credit card money (so no loss there). My girlfriend doesn't want her money back, so that's good.

My problem is, I'm still $27k in debt with the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even. If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700.

However, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?

81,investing,JonDyna965,Mining companies and engaging with communities and environmental advocacies,"A lot of mining sites of a chunk mining companies are located in various parts of the world. Mining activities can affect the environment and the communities in these mining sites, so I think mining companies should also prioritize projects that will promote responsible mining and inclusion of the local communities.

For instance, Newmont Corporation (NEM) has sustainability programs that involve environmental and social responsibility. The company has environmental standards that are designed to protect the environment and prevent or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate the impacts of their mining activities in the mining sites’ locations. They also involve the local communities, providing jobs and provisioning local goods and services, which makes them become an important player in catalyzing the economic development and social well-being of host governments and communities. They also have the [Global Center for Indigenous Community Relations](https://www.newmont.com/IndigenousCommunityRelations/default.aspx), whose role is to “to advocate for excellence in engagement with Indigenous Peoples, both within Newmont and across the industry.”

With junior companies, Solaris Resources ([SLS](https://www.google.com/search?q=TSE:+SLS&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDbPiiyvjK03SeBaxcoQEu1opBPsEAwAqUS8YSAAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMuov1vNHyAhXbAogKHZriDHMQsRUwIHoECDYQAw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=609)) has remarkable projects focusing on these matters. The company is very inclusive when it comes to the local miners in the community, and hired a lot of them, generating jobs for people. They also put a priority on using locally sourced products and services whenever practical, to benefit the regional economy. Also, the company has an environmental management project with the goal of minimizing the impact of mining on the environment. This is also more possible since the current president of Ecuador vowed to emphasize the enforcement of environmental protection rules and larger involvement from indigenous communities in deciding the future of mining projects.

Somehow, a lot of corporations feel less responsible for the damage they cause to the environment and to communities with their projects, so I think it should be the responsibility of these companies to change and be more inclusive and responsible. All these globalization and the current climate of economic rationalism is making these people less human and deprived of compassion and sense of responsibility.",1630326196,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/peh0q5/mining_companies_and_engaging_with_communities/

34,investing,AnmarAaluse,"My experience in creating the worst crypto coin ever - Turning Crypto Investments, to a vision.","Hi Crypto Enthusiasts,

Today I'll be sharing my journey in aiming to create one of the worst tokens (memecoin) ever deployed, from the very start. This could be a beneficial adventure for those seeking to start a new project, or those looking to invest in cryptocurrencies, hope you enjoy it!

Just in the end of July, after ""memecoins"" and crypto in general is forming a buzz word for a while especially after some making huge profits, a team was chosen to make something different. As a head start, memecoins are cryptocurrencies that have might not have utilities but grow based on their visions and targets, proven to be massively profitable in vast case studies. Having said that, the team want to address an issue or solve a problem, carrying a mentality that if we want to put any effort in this, it must have a life-changing impact!

So the initial step is to look at how to write the smart contract, which was obvious at that point to be mainly forked and standard by vast of the existing legit memecoin projects. Such projects rely on the what so called ""tokenomics"" to attract investors, which is in essence a percentage payable as tax, which is then redistributed according to how much an investor is holding. For instance, the buyer will buy 100 coins, then get only 90, where the 10 will be redistributed to all the holders, which will be repaid to the buyer in the same manner. So, We noticed that this tokenomics is actually profitable to the devs, the marketing wallet, and the very top holders only. So we decided to make the taxes zero; getting out from the memecoin concept aren't we? - Well, we kept pushing forward.

So it was decided, no fees will result in no redistribution, so what's next? the most important aspect, which is the vision of the whole project. So what issue will we be addressing? How can we make the maximum impact within a market where trust is becoming an issue perhaps threatening its existence?

We had an idea to track vast crypto articles and groups to identify the most repetitive word, guess what was that? yes, Fear - Doubt - Uncertainty aka F. U. D.

So what would we do with this word? we continued to monitor and note the activities of tens of memecoin groups until we noticed that the use of the word is mainly accompanied by a ban. And this was the weirdest point ever. So if an investor is doubting, he/she will be banned. If an investor is crossing the boundaries by asking where is his/her money, they get banned. Weirdest thing we ever saw, and couldn't understand. I mean, isn't an investor the same as a customer contributing to the success of the project? isn't the investor rightful to ask for progress even if it hurts developer/owner/admin feelings?

From there the idea was born; with a bit of research, it was noticed that criticism could mainly be constructive, and by constructive we can link ""care"". In other words, those who care are being silenced and banned which could be negatively impacting crypto adoption.

From this ideology we adopted the concept that says: fudding isn't bad, it is actually good! and this was the starting point, deploying an honorable idea token, with zero tax, we named it the FUDcoin Official. We created the Telegram group, pages, etc. So what is next? the marketing.

How can we market a coin that represent negativity, and make it so easy for everyone to understand what we stand for? and there it was, so obvious, negative marketing. So the marketing strategy being adopted (for the first time ever in Crypto), is that this is the worst project ever (perhaps this could make it the best). And here we go, we have the ethos, the vision, the roadmap, the token, and the strategy, and guess what? it was huge! everyone liked it. Negative marketing is hereby tested for the first time in the same market the rely heavily on positivism.  

Finally, we needed to set a launching date. What would the best possible launching date be to represent fear, negativity, doubt, and uncertainty? We googled the worst day and saw that in every year, if the 13th day of a calendar month hits a Friday, this could be the worst, representing bad luck. Opening our calendar guess what, Aug 13th, a Friday, in few days! Isn't that a sign? We believe it was.

For here folks this is part one of two parts, stay tuned to the post launch story, the results, and the angry marketing girl.

&gt;“Ever since the Fed and the Treasury and the world’s central banks rescued the global economy,"" and the Fed injected trillions of dollars into markets, investors have became “forced buyers,"" Marks said in a video interview Wednesday afternoon. That turned bargain hunting into a “very challenging"" activity, he said.

&gt;Marks said he sees opportunities in sectors such as airlines, hotels, resorts and movie theaters.

My take away: Nothing big, but does show Vascepa is extermely safe for people. And sets up for future studies in other areas.

**What I think will happen Monday US open**

My take away: Will be pressured down, but since upcoming catalysts coming, could be a buying opportunity. Frankfurt market will be interesting to watch.

**Next Catalyst 1: Prepare-IT 2 COVID study**

My take away: Cardio-Link was a similar study on a smaller scale that showed promising results. Supposedly Prepare-IT 2 should finish up this Monday. When we get the results who knows.

**Next Catalyst 2: German launch 13 days from now** [Link](https://amarinlaunchevent.eu/)

My take away: Amarin will have to PR the launch sooner or later. Plus the more info for rest of EU at launch date.

**Prediction:**

**$PFE** will work with AMRN to promote throughout EU. Kind of how they started with in Canada.

Hoping other people buy into it after you and push the price up - so you benefit.  


When the price goes high enough, you dump it.  
Thereby screwing over the other people who come in after you.  


So this is how you make money.  


The game is to make sure you get in and out before too many other people decide to dump it.   


Someone can tweet the price might go up a bit, false news about amazon adopting it (or some other news) gets created to drive the price up, exchanges pay news channels to have bitcoin talking heads on to promote this speculation,  the chinese miners get shut down (and dump) the price tanks, 

Not to mention the ticking time bomb that is the fraudulent stablecoins (operating off the cayman islands) or how 90% of the trades in cryptocurrencies is done by futures/options trading off the sketchy exchanges (manipulating the price) many of which are in the cayman islands.

&gt;  
&gt;The e-commerce giant is partnering with [Affirm](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AFRM) for its first-ever installment payments option on the popular e-commerce site.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm’s buy now, pay later checkout option will be available to certain Amazon customers in the U.S. starting Friday with a broader rollout in the coming months, the companies said in a statement. The partnership will let Amazon customers split purchases of $50 or more into smaller, monthly installments.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm’s stock spiked as much as 48% after-hours Friday on the news, adding more than $8 billion to its market capitalization, later settling up around 33%. Amazon shares were unchanged.  
&gt;  
&gt;Friday’s partnership is the latest sign of the booming lending space as younger consumers move towards these alternative lines of credit. Earlier in August, Square jumped into the space with a $29 billion [deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/02/square-to-buy-australia-fintech-afterpay-amid-buy-now-pay-later-trend.html) to buy Australian fintech Afterpay.  
&gt;  
&gt;So-called installment loans have been around for decades, and were historically used for big-ticket purchases such as furniture. Online payment players and fintechs have been [competing ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/10/pay-later-is-booming-with-a-wave-of-companies-launching-installments.html)to launch their own version of “pay later” products for online items in the low hundreds of dollars.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm is one of the best known installment payment options. It works with more than 12,000 merchants, including [Peloton](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PTON) and [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT).  
&gt;  
&gt;[PayPal](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PYPL), Klarna, [Mastercard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MA) and Fiserv, [American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP), [Citi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C) and [J.P.

&gt;  
&gt;Affirm said some of the Amazon customer loans will bear interest, but some will come with 0% APR.  
&gt;  
&gt;“By partnering with Amazon we’re bringing the transparency, predictability and affordability that Affirm provides today to the millions of people who shop on Amazon.com in the U.S.,” Eric Morse, Senior Vice President of Sales at Affirm, said in a statement. “Offering Affirm’s alternative to credit cards also delivers more of the payment choice and flexibility consumers on Amazon want.”

Looking at his company's fundamentals, there are some very attractive features financially, but the declining businesses owned by Biglari were my first red flag. Biglari started by buying Shake Shack, and now owns five businesses that in my opinion are all not great. He currently owned over 60 percent of Biglari holdings via his own personal shell company, Biglari capital corp, which coincidentally owns 50 million in Berkshire Hathaway. 

He holds annual meetings similar to how Berkshire does, but according to past attendees, the meetings usually involve shareholders berating him for ridiculously high compensation.   Unlike Buffett, Biglari did not start by being an investor, but instead sold a company he owned at the peak of the internet bubble. He also lives lavishly, with a huge house, expensive suits, and a wife who looks like a gold digger of gold diggers. What really made me look at him as a Buffett wannabe was the company website. Take a look at [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/) versus [Biglari](http://www.biglariholdings.com/).

Personally, I would not touch this company, I don't think Biglari is acting rationally but rather trying to fill an ideal even if his journey involves making bad decisions.

The Irvine, California-based startup said in a statement Friday that it submitted its S-1 registration to the Securities and Exchange Commission, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg News. The company would like to do an IPO around the Nov. 25 Thanksgiving holiday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the filing was confidential. The timing will depend on approval from the SEC.

Should Rivian go public at an $80 billion market capitalization, it would be one of the biggest debuts on that basis this year. With $10.5 billion raised from backers including Amazon and Ford Motor Co., an established factory in Illinois and thousands of reservation holders for its R1T truck and R1S sport utility vehicle, Rivian is among the most serious competitors lining up to take on electric-vehicle leader Tesla Inc.

61,investing,zero_to_one_,Lessons from Peter Thiel on investing,"**#1 Progress and profits come from monopolies, not competition**

Capitalism is about accumulating wealth. But in a world of perfect competition, nobody actually makes any money; all economic profits are competed away. Competition should be avoided wherever possible. Rather it is worthwhile to think about how to run away from the fighting and build a monopoly business instead.

**#2 A company messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed**

It’s pretty much impossible to fix a bad company culture when you already have thousands of employees. Make sure you’re investing in a company that has had the right culture since day one.

**#3 Founders are built different**

Most traits are probably normally distributed. Most people are average. Founders are not. Founders’ traits seem to have an inverse normal distribution to them. Founders are at the extremes on both ends: they are extreme insiders and extreme outsiders, disagreeable and charismatic, infamous and famous.

**#4 Great companies have “secrets”**

Risk aversion and complacency discourage people from thinking about secrets. Existing conventions are much more comfortable. But secret truths can be incredibly valuable. The question of how many secrets exist in our world is roughly equivalent to how many startups people should start. From a business perspective, then, there are many great companies that are waiting to be started.

**#5 The last mover advantage**

You’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first entrant into a market, you can capture significant market share while competitors scramble to get started. That can work, but moving first is a tactic, not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn’t matter nearly as much as being the last mover!

**#6 Be a contrarian, but also right**

There is usually little value to be found where there is unanimity. Value tends to be hidden. The key question is: What important truth do very few people agree with you on? The business version of this is: What valuable company is nobody building? A certain degree of contrarianism is embedded in these questions. Wrestling with them can lead to important truths.

70,investing,cbus20122,"Some Thoughts on Fed Policy and ""Policy Mistakes"" As We Start Talking About Tapering","For the people out there who follow the macro environment, there is always a lot of discussion in past market bursts (such as 2008 or 2000) that there are or were fed policy mistakes that either caused or contributed to the meltdown.

This is relevant now because as we come into talks about tapering, there is a lot of chatter about a potential fed policy mistake one way or another. 

But I think this is a poor way to think about these items, and views of mistakes completely ignore the context of the macro environment and ***why*** the fed made the supposed mistakes in the first place. 

**Most Policy Mistakes Are Fed Decisions Where They're Forced To Choose Between Two Bad Choices**

# Fed Policy Quick History: Caught Between Tough Choices

Lets start with a quick history of important fed decisions, many which have been labeled policy errors in the past. 

* **1980-1982 Volcker Rate Shock:** This was the worst recession the USA had since the GFC, and capped off an era where Inflation was the boogeyman and there were multiple bad recessions and employment shocks. At this time, inflation was running extremely hot (over 10%), and it was starting to get out of control. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Raising interest rates would kill the economy, which was already having a tough time dealing with the inflation of the time. Rates would have to rise to 18%, which would seriously cut off lending growth. But it would effectively stem the tide of inflation. Volcker chose the very tough decision to raise rates to 18%, which effectively cut inflation down significantly.   
Another point worth making is that the introduction of Reagonomics was a key factor in reversing the age of inflation of the 1970's, where there was a significant lack of investment in new productive capacity.  At the time, this was extremely beneficial. OF course, we're more or less at the opposite end of that spectrum right now where we have a glut of overinvestment and have possibly taken the 80's policies too far (obviously subject to political debate and views).  
* **1998 LTCM Bailout:** This was a historic bailout that occurred during a time of a lot of international market turmoil (Asian financial crisis + Russian default) and a burgeoning US equity bubble (dotcom bubble was starting to really pick up steam here).  The sudden failure of LTCM however threatened systemic issues in the financial system, and thus became the first bailout of a private hedge fund by the FED. This was a new precedent, and many believe it kickstarted the parabolic phase of the dotcom bubble. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Do you allow the LTCM meltdown to spill into the rest of the US banking system and economy, or do you bail out LTCM and support the economy + job growth? The fed chose the latter, which at the time supported their mandate of stable prices and full employment. They did not have a crystal ball suggesting an even greater equity bubble would form from this. 
* **2000-2003 Dotcom Bubble Burst:** After likely contributing to the dotcom bubble with the LTCM bailout and interest rate decrease, inflation started to rise a bit in late 1999, and credit growth and equity mania forced the Fed's hand to cap the bubble before it became even more difficult to control. The fed did a few emergency rate hikes, and the credit cycle quickly turned down, which had been feeding the dotcom mania. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Critics of the fed would have said that the emergency rate hike burst the bubble. Critics of the fed also said that they let the bubble get out of hand. Literally, there was no good choice here except to bite the bullet and hope the landing wasn't too hard. In reality, the *real* economy did have a soft landing in the dotcom bubble, partially thanks to the fed's interest rate decrease after the bubble really started to get going. 
* **2007-2008 GFC:** After dropping interest rates to keep the economy afloat during the GFC, very few people wanted anything to do with equities, especially tech stocks. This caused a shift in behavior towards real estate, which was already quite strong and resilient even during the dotcom crash. At the same time, the global economy was recovering from the crises of the late 90's and dotcom era, the euro was being adopted as a currency, and China was rising as a member of the world trade organization. All of the above created a perfect storm for US real estate getting piled into via carry trades, while the US Dollar was getting depreciated by all the above factors. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** The fed clearly started to see the monster that was being created in 2005. Not only was credit growth going parabolic + real estate lending going off the charts, but inflation was also surging in the USA due to all the aforementioned factors. Gas prices surged to over 4$ per gallon (at a time when many drove ""clunkers""), Copper surged to very high prices, and real estate / rent was also going parabolic. Greenspan was looking into a surge in inflation that hadn't been seen since the 70's, and was forced to decide between allowing real estate and inflation to go completely unchecked, or to raise rates very quickly to stem the flows from getting more and more out of hand.   
He chose the latter of raising rates, which then led to the chain reaction causing the GFC. Thing is, we don't know how much worse things may have gotten if Greenspan chose to ***not*** raise rates. Think of how much larger the US real estate bubble would have become if it wasn't cut off at the source. As bad as things got in 2008, they could have been worse if they allowed things to continue. 
* **Post GFC Environment:** After the GFC, the Fed shifted stance and most central banks became far more accomodative. The reaction of policymakers to any asset drawdowns has become far quicker and far larger. With that said, there have been some scares where the fed was tightening a little bit, which threatened to choke off the economy. The most noteworthy one was in late 2018, where the rate hikes and QE Rollback caused a 20% drop in markets before the fed reversed policy to engineer the 2019 rebound. This was likely a close call in some regards.   


# Lessons and Takeaways

From all the above, there are a few important lessons for investors when it comes to understanding equity and credit cycles + risk in the macro economy.   


1. **The party likely will or can continue so long as the central bank / government are accomodative:** You'll notice that all of the above recessions occurred during a time when the central banks were ***forced*** to tighten financial conditions.   

2. **Inflation (asset inflation or economic inflation) is always what takes the punch bowl away:** So what causes the fed or government to reverse accommodative policy? Almost always inflation. With a mandate to maintain stable prices and employment, inflation in the real economy tends to damage consumer's wallet and destabilizes prices. Inflation in assets typically comes with credit expansion, and threatens to destabilize employment and prices as it becomes larger and increasingly more fragile. These items generally tie the central banks' hands and force them into tough decisions. The ***levels*** at which the fed is forced to take away the punch bowl however is a lot more subject to opinion, and definitely not precise however.   

3. **Raising rates or tightening policy into an overleveraged environment creates systemic risk:** If you note the difference between the 1980's rate increase from Volcker, and the interest rate increases from the GFC or even in 2018, you'll notice how much more sensitive the economy is to rising rates. And furthermore, you'll likely realize how much more convex the downside gets with the more debt that exists in a system.   

4. **Debt in a system puts a soft cap on long term inflation rates:** Because central banks tend to get forced into action when inflation rears its head, and because the central bank behavior causes debt defaults and credit issues to arise, this forms something of a natural soft ceiling on how high both inflation as well as interest rates will go before triggering a deflationary shock. Once again, this isn't any set level, but you get a good broad view of this by looking at long term interest rates since the 80's, and then looking at aggregate leverage / credit.   

5. **The fed shifting to less accomodative stances isn't consistent with timing of market selloffs or recessions:** If you're trying to time the market based off this alone, you may get it right some times, but other times you would be far off. This timed the top of the dotcom bubble, but also missed out on the top of the GFC by over two years and quite a few rate hikes. It also missed out on most of the gains in 2017 and 2018 despite rising rates.   

6. **The fed doesn't make ""mistakes"", they make choices to deal with the problem at hand over the problems that may occur in the future:** In nearly every situation, the fed's dilemma caused them to choose between dealing with the problem that is currently occurring in the market with the risk that their solution could cause a problem somewhere else down the road. In every instance, the fed chooses to deal with the ***current*** problem over the problem that may be. And most people would not do anything different, because we don't have crystal balls and can't predict the future. I do think the fed has made bad choices, but most of the choices actually fit their **mandate**. In other words, don't hate the player, hate the game.",1629996638,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pc3h3m/some_thoughts_on_fed_policy_and_policy_mistakes/

So far, my understanding is:

1. There is no legal precedent to disallow non-residents from opening an account in Canada
2. Any brokerage doing so would need to be licensed in the US (and likely, my state) as well as Canada

They are the largest logging company in the world by market cap (11.71B) and by production capacity (6735 MMfbm). Canfor is a very close competitor with a capacity of 6700 MMfbm. 
Canfor has a very similar story. They are based in Vancouver, and despite their high production and production capacity, they are valued at more than ⅓ of WFG.
	The industry is closely tied to economic conditions, and lumber has recently been at record prices. Since then, lumber prices have come down to close to the decade average. The economic concerns here are not very important, but it will be important to consider that the high lumber prices may have artificially boosted operating results. 

A comparison of the two lumber companies (Dollar figures are all in CAD):

|Metric|WFG|Canfor|
:--|:--|:--|
|Market Cap|11.71B|3.34B|
|Revenue|5.850B|5.454B|
|Net Income|776M|559M|
|Lumber production (MMfbm)|5958|5204|
|Debt/Equity|0.2|0.25|
|ROE|24.6%|21%|
|Current Ratio|2.5|2.1|
|Total assets|5.32B|5.108B|
|Total Equity|3.155B|2.664B|



Comparatively, it is quite confusing why Canfor is worth so little. WFG has slightly more sales, net income, production, and balance sheet size. But does an eight percent difference in figures really warrant WFG to be worth almost four times as much as Canfor? They have slightly more efficient operations, and their balance sheet is slightly healthier, but when looking at some of the price ratios such as P/E and P/B, Canfor suddenly becomes more favorable. 
	Canfors’ balance sheet has grown significantly since 2014 from 2.48B to 5.1B, giving us a CAGR of 11%, which is partially attributable to an excessively favorable economic environment. WFGs balance sheet CAGR over the same period is 8%. Sales follow a similar trend. It is more clear now that the lesser's financial position is at the expense of greater growth. 	Constructing a conservative DCF may also provide some more insight. Here are the results I got from my calculations:
	
|Company|Price Range, 10Y DCF|Margin of safety|
:--|:--|:--|
|Canfor @21|$100-$120|79-82%|
|WFG @76|$200-$250|62-69%|



As you can see, the valuations are pretty crazy. I have not seen businesses that can generate cash like this in a long time. Both of them look incredibly attractive on this metric.
	
As an investment thesis, I would have to choose Canfor. They are so similar operationally and in numbers, yet their price is ridiculously low even for a conservative valuation.",1629947560,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pbr0m3/canfor_versus_west_fraser_timber/

&gt;The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

&gt;The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019.

&gt;Instead, Polaris, which will come online this year, will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine, the people familiar with the matter said.

A more technical breakdown can be found from the [DOE's lab's website](https://www.anl.gov/article/us-department-of-energys-argonne-national-laboratory-and-hewlett-packard-enterprise-prepare-for).

To be clear, the Intel deal is merely delayed, but not canceled. How does this change the narrative of Nvda/AMD versus Intel in the high-end server and super computer space? Are these kind of delays very common? I.E It's not a big deal.

Powell is expected to make press on economic policy this Friday 08/27/21 
The much anticipated Jackson Hole symposium kicks off on Thursday, where central bankers will potentially provide updates on their plan around tapering monetary stimulus. The Federal Reserve has been purchasing at least $120 billion of bonds per month to curb longer-term interest rates and jumpstart economic growth as the pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy.

I've heard the saying that when economists say there will be a correction, it is the time to buy. And when the Government (the Fed) says the economy is in a good space, it is time to sell. 
This is just all from anecdotal and media. I might be wrong. 

Taper talk is the worry, but if inflation continues to run hot and economic data continues to be mixed the timing of tapering could get pushed,” noted Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. “It’s unlikely that the Fed will force a taper on an economy that isn’t ready, and the outlook is becoming less certain with the rise of the Delta variant.”

Bell added that the deciding factor could be August’s jobs report due Sept. 3, given that Covid cases have jumped in the past month as the delta variant spreads.

Several tech companies will report earnings on Wednesday after the market closes, including Dow component Salesforce. Box and Snowflake are also on deck.

35,investing,Market_Madness,Ratio Review: Price to Sales Ratio,"#**Introduction**
The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

Every method of valuation has its pros and cons. For example, the price to earnings ratio can only be used on profitable companies and the price to book ratio is quite terrible with companies that are heavy on intangible assets. I’ve already done write ups on these two ratios for anyone new to these. 

So, none of them are perfect, but one of them can come quite close – with a little bit of help. I’m going to explain what price to sales is, why it works, how to use it, and then I’m going to make a modification to increase its effectiveness.

#**What is P/S?**
The price to sales ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s total market cap by it’s total revenue. Why it’s called price to sales and not price to revenue, who knows, but revenue is simply the number of sales times the number of units sold so the name isn’t too far off. 

What is this ratio actually saying? It’s a way of normalizing the relationship between the market cap and the revenue. Let’s say a company’s market cap is $100 and that their revenue was $25. Dividing 100 by 25 results in a price to sales of four. This means that this company earns 1/4th of its total value each year. This number on its own doesn’t really mean anything, but it’s a way to compare companies to each other. Let’s say we have a second business that has a market cap of $300 and a revenue of $100 which results in a price to sales of three. When market caps and revenues are in the billions it can be hard to tell which one makes proportionally more money. When you normalize them like this you can see that the second company makes 1/3rd of its value each year vs the 1/4th from the first example. 

Knowing this, it makes sense to buy companies with lower price to earnings ratios because a lower ratios means you’re making proportionally more money for your size.

#**Real application**
Most fundamental ratios are aimed at finding good value stocks that may be underpriced, however not everyone is looking for traditional value stocks. Price to sales is one of the few ways to value growth stocks as well as stocks that are not yet profitable. These types of companies often have low or negative earnings. This is likely because they are either just starting to grow, or because they are reinvesting everything back into the company to attempt to grow faster. If you were using price to earnings these would appear to have incredibly high or non-existent ratios and would be quickly ignored by most people. Price to sales still very much applies to value stocks, I simply wanted to show that it’s not exclusive to them like many other ratios are.

So now you know how to calculate it and that it can be used on almost anything, but how do you actually use it. If you’ve read my other write ups or watched any of my videos you’ll become very familiar with this answer – you use it to compare similar companies in similar industries. The reason for this is because you want to minimize external factors that could shift the results one way or another. Price to sales is often considered to be a judge of popularity because some sectors will have higher ratios simply because they are more popular industries. Innovative new companies working on artificial intelligence or green energy will likely have higher ratios than tobacco or oil companies even if their financial statistics and growth expectations were the same. This is simply because people *like* those companies more.

#**The good and the bad of using sales**
Let’s dive into the positives of using sales or revenue as a metric. The revenue a company earns is a pretty straightforward number. There are fewer precursory steps to reach it than something like earnings or book value, both of which can be manipulated by different business and accounting practices. This means that it’s generally more reliable than anything that is derived later down the line. As I mentioned before, it can be applied to a wider array of companies because basically every company has a revenue. It also does not get influenced by the ratio of tangible or intangible assets like book value can. This makes it sound far superior to both anything that uses earnings or book value, but it does have some pitfalls. 

I had two example companies above, one company worth $100 and earning $25 and one company worth $300 and earning $100. We determined that the second one, which has a P/S of three, was better. What if the first company only had $10 in expenditures while the second company had $75? The $100 company would take home $15 in profit and the $300 company would only take home $25 despite being three times larger. When you multiply P/S by the profit margin you arrive back at P/E. The lesson here is that revenue doesn’t mean as much when you don’t know the profit margins. If you don’t want to be tricked by this, either compare companies that have similar profit margins, or make sure both P/S and P/E agree on which company is better. 

The next pitfall on our list is the issue of cash and debt. A company with more debt has more leverage. They can spend additional money which allows them to generate additional returns. A company with no debt might have $10 to spend which might yield $20 in revenue. A company with x2 leverage has $20 to spend which might yield $40 in revenue. This boosts their revenue but it’s because they were taking on more risk, not because they actually performed better. Thankfully this also has a pretty nice fix. Let’s make up yet another hypothetical company. Company C has a market cap of $500, a revenue of $100, this would give it a P/S of 5. It also has $25 in cash, and $125 in debt. This company has a good chunk of debt which gives them some additional leverage. To make this more normalized we can convert their market cap, the P in our P/S equation, to EV which stands for enterprise value. EV is calculated by taking the market cap and adding the debt and then subtracting the cash. So, for Company C that comes out to be 500 + 125 – 25 = 600. You can now use this to get their EV/S, which is six. This is higher than the five they had before because we took away their leverage. Now all companies can be compared on a more even footing. 

#**Conclusion**
Price to sales, or as we will now call it, EV/S, is generally considered to be the most effective fundamental ratio out there. Now, just because it is the best doesn’t mean you should use it alone. You should always use fundamental ratios as only one of many available tools. 
Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, let’s see how it does stack up even on its own so that we can give it a fair comparison to other ratios and ideas. Buying stocks with a low P/S ratio outperformed broad market indices 95% of the time during any 10 year period from 1953-2003. During this same period the lowest P/S stocks outperformed the highest P/S stocks by a factor of over 1,000. The stocks with the lowest P/S ratios had an average return of 17.46% and the stocks with the highest had an average return of 3.12%. Whether this will continue to work in the future is, as always, not guaranteed.
If you want to make use of this tool for yourself, use EV/S and make sure you look at profit margins. Between these two points you’ll have accounted for the two pitfalls discussed. Use it on similar industries and use it as part of a set. Thank you for reading. 

#**TLDR**
Price to sales can be misleading on its own, but you can mostly fix this by accounting for differing levels of cash and debt as well as by checking profit margins. This new ratio, after the adjustment, is called EV/S and it is the most effective fundamental ratio, at least on its own. It can be used on value stocks, growth stocks, and even unprofitable companies. Use it, along with other tools, to compare similar companies to find which one is most likely underpriced.

Here's the article, by Nick Maggiulli: [Are we in a melt up?](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/are-we-in-a-melt-up/)

69,investing,Justingolw,Fundamental Analyst Question - Why on earth would a stock trade below its book value ?,"*Just a small background of me no need to read*  


*Hi guys, so for all my life I've been a conservative and fundamentalist investor ( sadly it has not yielded me much of the gains I want ) and at my current age 20-30's i thought to myself if i won't take more riskier positions now as a young adult with no family depending on me. Then when should i take on more riskier portfolios and investment opportunities?*   


*Recently got into crypto and well boy let me tell you, Fundamental Analysis quickly goes out of the window here. It's unregulated, unenforceable, and most countries have no feasible legislation as to its implementation most especially with block chains and smart contracts ( it's basically the new technology which incorporated bitcoin's tech into having utility and purpose ). This is what sold me on crypto currency sometime last year actually when I saw first hand how a block chain network could actually provide utility now. As a fundamental investor on crypto I was sold. Now a decent chunk of my portfolio is in stocks and i'm looking to move it into crypto soon.*

  
To all fundamental analyst of securities and stocks in particular, I've personally been bothered by this for a long time. Why on good earth would a stock sell below its book value ? I mean I just don't get it. It should be no brainer that people should be buying out that stock because if that company closed down tomorrow you'd be getting your money's worth   


If a stock has a book value of let's say 10 usd per share and it's being traded on an exchange for 2 usd per share. Isn't this free 8 usd per share you're taking home ?   


*This is Warren Buffet's intelligent investor point really and it's to focus on the fundamental side of the business and not on the current market conditions ( tried to follow this strategy but so far it's been nothing but safe and slow investments )*

70,investing,Justingolw,"What ""currency"" or liquid asset has the lowest inflation and deflation rate?","Hey guys for the longest time I always thought that inflation was the only bad thing but after doing some research a bit now deflation is as equally bad as it causes:   


1.) delayed purchases ( people won't buy things knowing that their money would deflate in value so they can purchase that new house or new car for fewer monies the next year )   


2.) Deflation causes disruption in loans, bonds, treasury bills and etc. If the Goverment borrows money say 1,000,000 USD to obviously pay its creditors at a higher rate let's sa 2% so 1,020,000 USD because of deflation the purchasing power of 1,020,000 would now be higher than what was originally intended  


Bottom line is inflation and deflation are neither good for the economy. So what asset is liquid that consistently retains its value overtime ?

Investments are backed by first lien position on the underlying property.,"The market is a little high IMO it's never a bad idea to diversify your portfolio, however bonds are paying a measly 1.5% 

I discovered Groundfloor early this year and began investing with them, all of their investments are backed by the actual property so the risk is MUCH lower than with stocks (especially at current valuations) Groundfloor is regisrered with the SEC and has been in operation since 2013. Over the past 8 years they have delivered an average of 10.46% a year.

Do your DD and check it out, it makes sense to have at least 1/3 of your portfolio in a stable investment to which you can flip into stocks if we experience a severe pullback and in the meantime earn over 10% with little risk.

I recently added voluntary post-tax contributions (similar to Roth). I was thinking of putting this post-tax portion into a riskier portfolio. Nothing crazy, but like 100% VTI on the less risky side of things OR something like headgefundies excellent adventure on the riskier side, AND maybe a small percentage to Google, which is a company I strongly believe in.

My reasoning is that, since I don't have to pay taxes on my gains in this acct, the riskier plays are more justified. I'm sure there's a way to phrase this in terms of risk-adjusted, tax-adjusted expected returns.

Does this reasoning make sense? Is this something that people do (add risk to accts with no gains tax)?

92,investing,Puzzleheaded_Bus_418,Opendoor Q3 is going to blow away estimates,"Disclaimer: I’m long ~550 shares of Opendoor. 

OPEN recently reported a great Q2, beating estimates with revenue of $1.2B and a net loss of $143M. Q3 projected revenue from the company is $1.8-1.9B and unless I’m not understanding something correctly, I think they are about to post a $3B+ quarter in Q3.

Background: I used to spend 20-30 minutes a day looking through OPEN’s website and calculating the number of homes listed/sold. Was lucky to stumble upon ibuyerstats.com and I’ve found it to be fully reliable, saving me lots of time and it has some helpful analysis. 

Calculation: according to ibuyerstats.com, OPEN has listed 4,989 homes since July 1st. The total number of homes listed on OPEN (only homes that are OPEN owned, not just homes people list themselves) has increased by 503 since July 1st. So a simple calculation tells you that OPEN has sold ~ 4,500 homes so far this quarter. At an average selling price of $400k, OPEN has pulled in revenues of $1.8B in just 53 days (already what they were projecting for the whole quarter).

53 days is 58% of the days in a quarter, and when you add in the other 42% you get revenues of $3.1B, however this doesn’t include revenues from homes listed earlier than the start of Q3, their listing platform, and a general increase in sales that is likely to continue through the remainder of Q3. 

I’m completely open to any criticism as I’m genuinely curious if any of you think this simple calculation is a fair representation of the quarter OPEN is about to deliver. 

TLDR: OPEN looks like it may have a massive Q3.",1629839663,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pawh76/opendoor_q3_is_going_to_blow_away_estimates/

20,investing,anushi45sahak,Gold production from the eight largest miners is expected to increase by up to 3.1% in 2021.,"Gold production from the eight largest miners is expected to increase by up to 3.1% in 2021.

This comes after the [industry’s top gold producers](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/top-five-gold-mining-companies-world/) – Newmont, Barrick, AngloGold, Polyus, Kinross, Gold Fields, Newcrest and Agnico-Eagle – felt the effects of a 6.5% reduction in output to 24.98 million ounces in 2020, following lower ore grades, sale of assets, lower mill throughput and lower recoveries.

But data and analytics firm GlobalData [projects](https://www.globaldata.com/gold-production-top-eight-companies-expected-increase-3-1-2021-says-globaldata/) production from those companies to recover and reach somewhere between 25-25.75 million ounces in 2021.

The most significant falls in production last year were observed amongst the top three companies – Newmont (6.1%), Barrick (12.9%) and AngloGold (7.1%). The collective output from those miners declined to 13.7 million ounces in 2020 from 15 million ounces in 2019.

Vinneth Bajaj, associate project manager at GlobalData, said: “After a strong first quarter in 2020, Newmont’s production was impacted by lower ore grades at the Ahafo, Yanacocha and Merian mines and the temporary suspension of the Cerro Negro, Yanacocha, Eleonore, Penasquito and Musselwhite mines between March and mid-May. In addition, the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie projects further reduced output.”

Lockdowns imposed by governments impacted gold production last year

For Barrick, several gold mines were forced to cease operations temporarily due to the government lockdowns imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus infections, including the Veladero, Pueblo Viejo and Porgera sites.

Meanwhile, the divestment of African assets by AngloGold was a major factor behind the fall in the company’s output in 2020.

61,investing,LifeReboot___,"Long Term SPY Leaps Investment Strategy, What's Your Thoughts?","Hey guys, so I'm pretty new to options (\~1year), and I started out mostly doing short term bets, but recently I've been thinking about using Leaps in my long term investment portfolio.

The idea is simple, but first of all this is my thesis of the strategy:

* The market always go up in long term because of technology advancement, and economic activities.
* Bear market can happen, but usually last at most 5 years. (Probably the riskiest assumption in the entire strategy.)
* Consistent yearly investment into Leaps, for example buy $100k worth of Leaps every year for decades, or gradually increase the yearly investing amount with 5%\~10%.
* Buy OTM+10% SPY Leaps with 3 years expiry, then sell them after 2 years with 1 years left to expiry. (Obviously this part will need more thinking, but the idea is to have a consistent strategy, it can be buying ITM/ATM/OTM, or buying 0.5Delta, or sell every 1 year instead of 2, which I will need to run some back test to find out the best possible option.)

What I think this strategy is that it could outperform the market performance by the leveraging the market performance it self, and maintain a long term consistent (or gradually growing) exposure of SPY.

Obviously another criteria here is not to lose money or turn out wasting time because of the theta decay, that is why I would also sell the call options with \~1year before expiry.

To verify the strategy, I purchased SPX historical data from [historicaloptiondata.com](https://historicaloptiondata.com) and [cboe.com](https://cboe.com), to ""backtest"" the idea of this, because lack of skills in writing custom back test strategy, I only able to backtest manually with one variable at a time.

Because of the hassle of backtesting the strategy, I can only do simple backtest such as buying 1 option per year etc, but what surprise me is the average return of this said strategy are able to outperform dollar cost averaging SPY in the period of 2005-2021 for at least twice of the ROI.

What I'm trying to do next is to find a way or have someone write some back test strategy with the data, so I can run the strategy with more different variable to see if the results of outperforming is consistent, which may take some time.

&gt;  
&gt;**Dividend payments in the second quarter jumped 26% from the same period last year to $471.7 billion, just 6.8% below the levels seen in the second quarter of 2019.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Samsung surpassed Nestle as the world’s biggest dividend payer, with Rio Tinto, Sberbank and Sanofi also making the top five.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The research, published Monday, said 84% of companies around the world either increased or maintained their dividends compared to the same quarter in 2020.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Dividends paid to investors are projected to hit $1.39 trillion in 2021, reflecting a recovery that’s stronger than expected, according to a new report from British asset manager Janus Henderson.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The 2021 forecast for dividends is just 3% below the pre-pandemic peak, the firm found.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Dividend payments in the second quarter jumped 26% from the same period last year to $471.7 billion, just 6.8% below the levels seen in the second quarter of 2019. Janus Henderson projected that dividend payouts will return to pre-pandemic highs within the next 12 months.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The research, published Monday, said 84% of companies around the world either increased or maintained their dividends compared to the same quarter in 2020.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Much of the growth was attributed to companies restarting frozen payouts and issuing higher special dividends on the back of strong earnings. Underlying dividend growth in the second quarter, stripping out the effects of special dividends and exchange rates, was 11.2%.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Samsung](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined) surpassed [Nestle](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NES.N-CH) as the world’s biggest dividend payer, with [Rio Tinto](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RIO-GB), [Sberbank](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FKRX300) and [Sanofi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SAN-FR) also making the top five.  
&gt;  
&gt;Samsung distributed a total of $12.2 billion to investors once its regular dividend was included, and Janus Henderson anticipates that it will likely be among the world’s top five payers throughout 2021.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The rebound has been so much stronger than we anticipated, and I think it is very encouraging that we are seeing these companies feeling strong enough to return cash back to shareholders,” Jane Shoemake, client portfolio manager for global equity income at Janus Henderson, told CNBC on Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Geographical divergence  
&gt;  
&gt;**Payouts in the U.K. surged 60.9%, and in Europe climbed 66.4%, while most of the dividend cuts were in emerging markets**, the report said, reflecting the delayed impact from lower reported 2020 profits. It said dividend cuts in developed markets were “pre-emptive and precautionary.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**North America, meanwhile, saw record dividends in the second quarter, driven by Canada. However, payouts in the region had largely held up through 2020, meaning there was little rebound effect.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In Asia-Pacific outside of Japan, headline dividend growth was 45% annually in the second quarter, buoyed by Samsung’s one-off special dividend, with South Korea and Australia leading growth in the region. However, Singapore remained constrained by restrictions on banking payouts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Japanese dividend payments also remained robust in 2020, but still managed underlying growth of 11.9% year-on-year.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In emerging markets, however, dividends fell 3.2% annually on an underlying basis, pulled down by lower 2020 profits, while just 56% of emerging market companies raised or held dividends steady in the second quarter.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Portfolio implications  
&gt;  
&gt;**Mining companies showed the fastest growth on the back of booming commodity prices, while industrials and consumer discretionary companies also bounced back strongly, the Janus Henderson research showed. So-called defensive sectors, such as telecoms, food and household products, maintained their characteristically consistent single-digit growth rates.**  
&gt;  
&gt;“In terms of the highest yielding sectors, the financial services and commodity sectors dividend outlooks are the most improved since last year,” said Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson.  
&gt;  
&gt;The firm has been adding to positions in these sectors in its equity allocations over the past 12 months in a bid to capitalize on this rebound. Many banks and financial services companies were subject to regulatory restrictions on dividend payments during the pandemic, which are now beginning to lift.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The travel and leisure sectors remain hardest hit in terms of the Covid impact, and while many have adjusted operations to be able to survive, the sector is unlikely to be paying dividends until balance sheets recover, so we continue to avoid these for the time being,” Lofthouse added.",1629734217,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pa2pql/dividend_payouts_to_hit_14_trillion_in_2021/

46,investing,Market_Madness,Ratio Review: Price to Book,"#**Introduction**
The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

In this write up I’m going to be taking a deep dive into another incredibly popular metric – the price to book ratio. I’m going to start with a walkthrough of how you calculate it, then I’m going to cover how it should be used, then I’m going to go over some of the pros and cons of it, and most importantly I’m going to see if it gives you any kind of advantage when selecting stocks. 

#**What is P/B?**
A company’s price to book ratio is the ratio between the company’s current share price and their current book value per share. Book value is essentially the value of a company from the perspective of an accountant. Accountants don’t care about future earnings or potential speculation. They look at the current value of the business by taking all of the company’s assets and subtracting all of the company’s liabilities. This is then divided by the number of shares to get the book value per share. Once you have that you simply divide the share price by the book value per share to get the price to book ratio. 

#**Real Application**
Now I’m going to walk you through a real example. Total assets and total liabilities can be incredibly complex numbers to try and calculate, thankfully every public company will already have these numbers listed on their balance sheet which can be found on any number of websites. I grabbed Ford’s values from Yahoo Finance for this example. 

To find their book value you will be taking their total assets, which are things the company owns that have value and subtracting their total liabilities, which are things the company owes or is obligated to pay, like debt, interest payments, or workers’ wages. This is then divided by the number of shares in existence. This gives Ford a book value per share of 7.91. This means that for every $13.61 share - Ford has $7.91 of “real” value. Now the last step is to divide the price per share by this number which results in a price to book value of 1.72. 

Now before I can go into depth on how to interpret this number I need to explain the different ways to classify assets. Assets come in two forms, tangible, and intangible. This is important to know because it explains why some industries have significantly higher average price to book values than others. Tangible assets are most commonly physical things like factories, land, or machinery. However, they also include two less intuitive items which are cash and investment vehicles like stocks or bonds. The thing that all of these have in common is they have a relatively easy to find real monetary value outside of the company.

The other category of assets are called intangible assets which are things that are not physical and only have a theorized value. This can include copyrights, brands, or research. These have value but it’s far harder to put a price tag on them. In the standard price to book calculation the two will be added together if the intangible assets are given on the balance sheet. Another reason I defined both is because you will sometimes see people use price to tangible book value which means they did not consider intangible assets in their calculation. 

#**How to use P/B**
We calculated Ford’s price to book ratio as 1.72. Now like most fundamental ratios this seemingly random number each company has means absolutely nothing without some context. There is no definitive line of what defines a good or bad number because companies can have vastly different amounts of tangible vs intangible assets - and intangible assets are incredibly difficult to price. As with all fundamental ratios, you should only be using them as one of many data points to get an idea of how the business stacks up against similar competitors.

For example, a consulting firm with a handful of employees and one small office building could generate as much profit as the steel mill on the other side of town. But because the steel mill has a lot more physical assets it’s going to naturally have a much lower price to book ratio. These companies are effectively equal but if you use price to book blindly you won’t see them that way. This means that in order to get the most out of a price to book comparison you want companies that are within the same sector and often even within the same industry.

To illustrate this point, I calculated the average price to book ratio of all of the sectors over the past few years. The technology sector which relies heavily on intangible assets has an average price to book of 7.3 which is the highest. One interesting thing I found was that even among sectors that are very physical in nature the value varies by *a lot*. Industrials have an average of 4.8 whereas the energy sector has an average of only 1.65. 

But what do these numbers actually mean? The price to book value compares the current valuation of the company, which includes future growth and speculation, to their current value, according to the balance sheet. A price to book of 1.72 means that the stock price is valuing Ford at 72% more than what their current accounting value is. At the very least, this means that large investors have an idea of how much they’d lose if the company went bankrupt and needed to be liquidated. This tie to real value is one reason why value investors prefer low price to book ratios, although as we saw when looking at the sectors, low is relative. 

Let’s continue with the ford example and see how it can be used in practice. Let’s compare their 1.72 price to book value to tesla, who is the largest of all up and coming electric vehicle makers. Tesla has a price to book of 26.95 which shows that their price is almost entirely speculative and is incredibly disconnected from their current real value. For reference, the average price to book ratio for the automotive industry is about 4. You can see how Ford and Tesla stack up here. This doesn’t necessarily say that tesla isn’t something to buy, but it does say that it is a growth stock that people expect *a lot* from in the future. If tesla is not able to reach the levels of growth speculated it will appear to be a disappointment to its investors and has a lot farther that it can fall before it reaches a more stable price when compared to something like Ford. If Tesla fails miserably and goes bankrupt the shareholder is unlikely to get back more than a tiny fraction of their money. If ford fails miserably and goes bankrupt a large shareholder could potentially get more than half of their investment back – though the process of bankruptcy and liquidation is large and complex with varying results. 

#**What are the pros and cons of P/B?**
Price to book is a complex ratio that has a lot of implications. I’m going to go over a few of the benefits and shortcomings of it. Let’s start with the positives. 
* Price to book can be used on companies that have negative earnings. New companies that aren’t yet profitable are very common and without a positive net income can be difficult to compare to companies that are profitable. Many companies that aren’t profitable are still great businesses as long as they are heading in the right direction. 
* Price to book also offers investors a look into how much of the stocks price is based on real value and how much is based on speculation. This it is incredibly effective at separating growth from value stocks – so much so that the Russell indices use price to book for half of their decision weight when creating their value ETFs. 
Now let’s look at some of the potential downsides. 
* Price to book does not give any indication of how well a company is using its assets, only that it has them. If you have two companies that both have one million dollars’ worth of machinery and the same price to book ratio, you have no idea which one of those is actually making more money. This emphasizes the idea that you always need to look at a variety of  factors when trying to find good value companies. 
* Another downside is that it also struggles to incorporate intangible assets because they are often incredibly difficult to value. This makes comparisons between more physical and less physical companies nearly useless with this metric. 
* Lastly price to book value can vary from company to company because it relies on how that company does their accounting. This effect is even more pronounced if you try to compare companies from different countries. 

#**Does P/B give you any advantage?**
Now, can price to book value help you outperform the market by identifying undervalued stocks? It depends. The first thing it depends on is what type of company you are looking at. Price to book works far better on businesses that are physically intensive because the land, machinery, and factories all have significant real value. It also works well with banks and other financial institutions because cash, stocks, and bonds are all also considered tangible assets due to their easily identified real value. It does not work well when you are looking at intangible industries. Software companies, consulting firms, and pharmaceutical companies are all examples of highly intangible areas of business. 

So, if you are looking to compare tangible companies from a similar industry - price to book has historically been a fantastic predictor of value. The paper called “value vs glamor: a global phenomenon” goes into incredible depth regarding the performance of price to book value. From 1968 to 2008 the 10% companies with the lowest price to book value outperformed the highest 10% by an average of 9.3% annually. This is a massive amount and with this it is pretty clear why many index ETFs use price to book to build their value ETFs. 

However, it’s not all great news. The paper titled “price to book’s growing blind spot” which covers up until 2016, shows that the price to book ratio has been losing its edge in the last decade to the point where it has almost no benefit. This is a completely true phenomenon, but I want to explain why it may be misleading. 

The last 10 years have been a part of the strongest bull market in history and this market is being led by primarily technology stocks. If you recall, technology stocks are mostly intangible and therefore are not able to be judged accurately with this metric. It is up to you whether you think this trend will continue. If you do, price to book may not be a metric you want to use. However, if you are looking at the long term and expect the market to return to more historically average conditions then it is likely still an effective measure of finding value. 

#**Conclusion**
The price to book ratio has certainly earned its fame, at least historically. Aside from the past 15 years the price to book ratio has selected strong value stocks again and again. It’s up to you whether you want to bet for or against the current paradigm of the market which is dominated by intangible technology. This will determine whether or not you should make price to book one of your tools. 

###**TLDR:**
Historically P/B has been one of the best predictors of value. This trend has nearly completely disappeared in the past 10-20 years. This is likely due to the dominance of tech companies which are incredibly heavy on intangible assets. Ideally it should only be used as one of many data points when selecting a stock and should only be used to compare similar companies in similar industries. 

###**Mild subreddit self-promotion:**
If you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where myself, and eventually others, will be doing this style of research.

Pfizer recently went to push Amarin's drug Vascepa in Canada [Link](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hls-therapeutics-announces-promotional-agreement-with-pfizer-for-vascepa-r-in-canada-861060988.html)

Only time will tell.

This coming week Amarin's drug Vascepa will be prestented at ESC congess on Aug 29th with results showing it pay help treat COVID patients. If you can, I suggest to go watch the results that day.

Also last moment to trade shares once the COVID treatment results comeout will be on the Frankfurt exchange.

Recent article below by Amarin's CEO below. Put in bold what he said was important.

Then, in March 2020, U.S federal courts invalidated several patents for Vascepa, opening the door to generic competition and potentially shrinking sales of the company’s once-promising drug.

Amarin’s stock price fell by 50% virtually overnight.

The court rulings could have been a death sentence for a company like Amarin. Instead, it has rebounded with a risky, unusually aggressive strategy for a small drugmaker that markets and sells a single pill.

Karim Mikhail, Amarin’s CEO and a 22-year veteran of Merck, said the company will launch sales of Vascepa next month in the European Union and plans to expand into Asia and Africa next year. The company also has added sales staff to battle generic drugmakers for U.S. sales.

“People who fought for the value that this product brings to the market are not letting go today,” he said. “They risked their careers … to prove a point that this product brings enormous benefit.”

It plans to thread the needle to profitability with overseas sales and fighting off U.S. generic competitors by pushing doctors to prescribe Vascepa to more heart patients. Here in the U.S., it must do so by selling a drug that on average costs 77% more than generics.

J.P. Morgan analyst Jessica Fye still believes Vascepa will be successful, she said in investor notes, but sales will ramp up over 10 years.

This month, former Amarin CEO John Thero was succeeded by Mikhail, Merck’s former chief marketing officer in Europe and emerging markets. His appointment and the expansion of Amarin’s sales staff indicated the company plans to go it alone.

“Investors may be disappointed in the transition and that it may signal no near-term merger and acquisition on the table (which is the clear and primary bull case to the stock),” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote in a recent investor note.

Big pharmaceutical companies typically buy up startups to avoid the risk and expense of drug development. But companies like Amarin are rarely acquisition targets, according to studies by Michael Kinch, director of the Center for Drug Discovery at Washington University in St. Louis.

Vascepa joins a long list of cardiovascular drugs over the past two decades dominated by blockbusters marketed by Pfizer, Merck, Schering-Plough and AstraZeneca.

The most commonly prescribed heart medicines are today available as low-cost generics. And generics typically capture 95% of the brand-name’s sales three months after generic drugs hits the market, according to Wall Street analysts.

The generic version of Vascepa, has not experienced that level of success.

Mikhail said Vascepa was notoriously difficult to manufacture and the raw ingredients difficult to acquire in bulk. “Clearly, the generics never thought they would win this case,” he said. “The evidence is they were not ready with supply.”

The FDA says Vascepa’s mechanism in action to reduce stroke and heart attacks is “not completely understood.” Amarin claims the drug has anti-inflammatory properties and it has announced several academic centers are studying Vascepa as a possible treatment for colorectal cancer as well as Covid.

Mikhail said preliminary Covid study data is scheduled for release next week at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.

**“You look at what Covid patients die from, they mostly die because of an inflammatory storm,” he said. “If the study is positive, and it has value in delaying progression in Covid patients … that would be incredible.”**

**It would also give Amarin another escape hatch to deliver shareholder value.**",1629722600,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p9z1p9/pfe_buying_tril_will_amrn_be_next/

&gt;""The company on Wednesday announced it will give 50 billion yuan ($7.7 billion) to aid the government’s wealth redistribution efforts, adding to an April pledge of 50 billion yuan for a “sustainable social values” program. The new funds will be focused areas like increasing incomes for the poor, improving medical assistance, promoting rural economic efficiency and subsidizing education programs.   
&gt;  
&gt;Beijing’s campaign to rein in the internet sector is entering its 10th month, having expanded from e-commerce and antitrust into areas like data security and online content. The country this week offered an outline for “common prosperity” that includes income regulation and redistribution, a sign that the scrutiny is likely now expanding into the inordinate wealth tech companies have created for founders like Tencent’s Pony Ma.   
&gt;  
&gt;“This new strategy by Tencent is a proactive response to the national initiative,” the firm said in a WeChat statement. “As a Chinese technology company that has grown up in the age of reform and opening up, Tencent is constantly thinking about how to use its own technology and digital capabilities to help society develop, so as to better give back to society.”

This could be construed as China’s government directly taking profits from Tencent shareholders. 

At $15 billion, this is well over 50% of profits for the year, all towards ‘common prosperity’ to achieve the CCP’s national policy goals.",1629695844,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p9t4xn/chinese_tech_giant_tencent_pledges_an_additional/
96,investing,Kev762x51,Rolling random 401k's into an IRA,"Hello guys,

I have a quick question about 3 401K's I have from some old jobs. I have 30k in a 401k from an old job (vested) and 2 other 401ks worth 5k and 5k (both didn't vest unfortunately). So 40k total.

I was going to leave the 5k plans alone, because they have been getting 18%-35% each year for the last 3-5 yrs. BUT I was under the impression that maybe putting them all together and 40k in an IRA would generate more money ""snowballing"" together vs starting with just the 30k + of course my 6k/yr contributions.

Also- note I wanted to do a ROTH IRA but since my 40k1's are pre-tax I elected to do a traditional IRA and maybe convert to ROTH in the near future. Just wanted to mention incase someone asked why not ROTH.

So to recap, my main question is, should I leave the 10k split between 2 different plans that are doing very very well (5K at UBS and 5k TSP) or add the 10k to my 30k, to make my new IRA 40k even.

63,investing,FaintCommand,$EAR Plummeting to low 20s - justified?,"I'm trying to understand the drastic drop they've seen and am curious if anyone else following this stock has some insights?

$EAR (Eargo Inc) is a hearing aid manufacturer that is ""disrupting"" the market by selling customizable hearing aids online. They aren't for extreme hearing loss, but seem to be a good solution for mid-to-mild hearing loss. Their calling card seems to be that their devices are almost invisible, comfortable, long charges (16+ hours, I believe), and the devices can be controlled from a smartphone or with 'gestures' that adapt to different settings. *I don't know anything about hearing aids, so I'm just going by what I've read from reviews and reddit.* 

They dropped quite a bit after Q1 earnings despite beating EPS estimates, then dropped again with a big EPS miss in Q2, despite 44% YoY growth in revenue. Subsequently, the price has dropped about 70% from their February high to $21.48 as of Friday's close.

Dropping after a big EPS miss is not surprising, but dropping this much seems like an overreaction unless I'm missing something. They would seem to have a lot in their favor:

* They just launched their newest device (Eargo 5) very late in Q2, so one would expect significant revenue lift in Q3 and into the holidays once they put a marketing push behind the new product.
* [Early reviews](https://www.engadget.com/eargos-latest-smart-hearing-aids-bring-a-much-needed-hearing-test-160001810.html) on the new device have been strong as far as I can tell (overall their line of products seem to be well reviewed and very competitive on price). 
* On their Q2 presentation they alluded to making inroads with payer relationships. 
* Even without better payer coverage, [Biden's recent executive order](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/biden-order-takes-aim-at-high-cost-of-hearing-aids-calls-for-otc-sales/603114/) calling for OTC sales of hearing aids and directive towards fair pricing would seem to provide some future tailwinds for a company like Eargo, who is already significantly lower priced than higher end hearing aids. 
* The total TAM should be expanding. Its estimated that 17% of Gen Xers and 10% of Millennials [already experience some level of hearing loss](https://www.ameritasinsight.com/wellness/hearing/why-millennials-and-generation-z-employees-have-hearing-loss). It is naturally expected that those numbers will grow with age. A digitally-forward, stigma free hearing aid solution would seem like an ideal product for those generations. 

So what am I missing? Clearly investors see something wrong here that I'm missing for this company to plummet 70% (so far - not sure how much further it might drop).",1629597757,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p93z9y/ear_plummeting_to_low_20s_justified/
68,investing,alimessimourad,BABA earnings analysis and investment,"Moving all noise aside and concentrating primarily on a business as if it was not even a public company is what counts (E.g Buying a bakery, hairdresser salon or anything else that produces cash). This will help you genuinely value a business without emotion. 

The most important aspect of a business is its ability as to how much cash it can generate on UNLEVERAGED net tangible assets. 

Alibaba's business is a lot more complicated compared to a simple hairdresser business but if you really only only concentrate on one business and analyse it thoroughly you will come to a ballpark figure.
 You wiol find that all internet based companies operate on hardly any Tangible assets which will allow them to generate piles of cash without plowing a tonne of cash into it every year. 

Alibaba is one of those businesses that can produce without the need of a shitload of Tangible asset re-investment. 
If you really look into their balance sheet and their returns you will see that alibaba is an extraordinary business running on very little UNTA (Unleveraged net tangible assets).
 
I can go on all day but we'll take a rough approach to last year's true earnings (without the EBITDA, or adding back Stock back compensation to earnings) they produced roughly $18 billion (adding back some amortization of intangible assets and the anti-monopoly fine paid but not adding depreciation of PP&amp;E because eventually you will need to reinvest that amount or close to it). In my opinion alibaba required app. $33 billion to operate which is give us about a 55% return on capital employed. An outstanding return for a company of this magnitude, remember this company is investing heavily is R&amp;D.

If you minus all liquid/net assets(which do account for something in the long run) you are virtually buying this company's for approximately $370B

Now we haven't even progressed to making a profit from CLOUD which is inevitable and very enticing because it has a healthy profit margin  (Look at AWS) and we haven't accounted for its $11 billion dollars of other income. 

They are building an ecosystem and they are investing in Loss-making operations which is questionable for me, are they allocating capital efficiently? Something I can not predict and is highly questionable. 
Ending it here is a question everyone should ask themselves before investing, Are they created a dollar of value for every dollar made?

Can you actually hedge somehow? 
You buy for example long gold future with longer date and a shorter term gold future just to achieve a zero sum game without terminating the trade bc of date differences? (I only would use options on futures just to hedge, bc I don‘t know what happens to a future I have to buy back)… put/call options are protected, am right? 

Also how fast do emergency transfers happen?",1629553449,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p8rpbg/how_much_time_does_one_have_to_close_out_their/

But the automotive and consumer electronics sectors are having to cut back production at huge costs for some manufacturers.

Chip companies are jostling for market share, niches and government benefits. TSMC and Intel are competing for technology leadership and preferential construction deals, while SMIC in China is still trying to catch up with the headwinds of US sanctions.

The article points out that after the chip shortage and pandemic related buying there could be overcapacity as a result of the drive to chip supply independence. And that this could result in increased competitive pressures between manufacturers and countries.

A California judge on Friday ruled that a 2020 ballot measure that exempted ride-share and food delivery drivers from a state labor law is unconstitutional as it infringed on the legislature’s power to set standards at the workplace.

Proposition 22 is unconstitutional as “it limits the power of a future Legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers’ compensation law”, which makes the entire ballot measure “unenforceable”, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch wrote in the ruling.

Gig economy companies including Uber, Lyft, Doordash and Instacart were pushing to keep drivers’ independent contractor status, albeit with additional benefits.

The ballot measure was meant to cement app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers’ status as independent contractors, not employees.

Known as Proposition 22, it marked the culmination of years of legal and legislative wrangling over a business model that has introduced millions of people to the convenience of ordering food or a ride with the push of a button.",1629514163,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p8jkgh/cnbc_california_superior_judge_on_late_friday/

*\[…\] it’s not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it’s so limited.*

*Co-Diagnostics certainly has been  doing a good job lately as it’s been growing earnings more than most  other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because  investors think this strong earnings performance might be less  impressive moving forward.*

*Shares in Co-Diagnostics are going to  need a lot more upward momentum to get the company’s P/E out of its  slump. Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you  should sell your stock isn’t sensible, however it can be a practical  guide to the company’s future prospects.*

*We’ve established that Co-Diagnostics maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected.*

### Methodology

For each stock from NASDAQ and NYSE scores are calculated for each of the following areas:

* Valuation
* Profitability
* Growth
* Health

The scores are calculated using the indicators shown in  colored boxes above. For instance, to assess stock’s profitability,  Return on Assets (**ROA**), Return on Equity (**ROE**) and **Net Margin**  are taken into account. The algorithm looks up the value of ROA in  every stock belonging to the same industry and compares it against the  analyzed stock, providing a final rank: if there are 20 stocks and 5 of  them have higher ROA, then the ROA-associated score is (20-5)/20 \* 100 =  75, meaning that the ROA is better than in 75% of stocks. We want ROA  to be higher than in the other companies; sometimes, however, we want  the indicator’s value to be lower than in peers, as is the case with  Price to Book ratio (**P/B**).

In the next step, the mean score across ROA, ROE and Net  Margin is calculated. Similar calculations are done for stock’s  Valuation, Growth and Health. The algorithm starts with Valuation score,  requiring it is at least 50/100. Then it proceeds with Profitability,  Growth and Health scores, each time requiring the score to be 50 or  higher. Finally, the mean value across all four areas of interest are  calculated. Only highest ranking stocks subjected to further manual  inspection.

&amp;#x200B;

### Definitions

**P/E** (Price to Earnings ratio): the ratio of a  company’s share (stock) price to the company’s earnings per share (EPS).  A high Price-Earning ratio indicates that investors are expecting  higher growth of company’s earnings in the future compared to companies  with a lower Price-Earning ratio. A low Price-Earning ratio may indicate  either that a company may currently be undervalued or that the company  is doing exceptionally well relative to its past trends. The long-term  average P/E for the S&amp;P 500 is around 16x.

**P/B** (Price to Book ratio): compares a company’s  current market value to its book value (where book value is the value of  all assets owned by a company). Except in the case of a small minority  of companies, like property companies and investment trusts that are  asset-based, book values can bear little or no relationship to true  values of the companies. In many of today’s companies, their most  valuable assets are not shown on the balances sheet and are therefore  not necessarily reflected in the company’s book value (e,g, copyrights,  intellectual capital). Despite the limitations of the price-book ratio,  academic research has repeatedly shown that stocks with low price-book  ratios tend to outperform stocks with high price-book ratios in the  United States and other stock exchanges.

**EV/EBITDA**: a popular valuation multiple used to  determine the fair market value of a company. EV stands for Enterprise  Value, while EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes,  depreciation, and amortization. A key advantage of EV/EBITDA is that it  is independent of the capital structure (i.e. the mixture of debt and  equity). Therefore this multiple can be used to compare companies with  different levels of debt. It also avoids the significant shortcoming of  the P/E ratio which can be materially affected by the level of leverage  in the company. As of Jan. 2020, the average EV/EBITDA for the S&amp;P  500 was 14.20. As a general guideline, an EV/EBITDA value below 10 is  commonly interpreted as healthy and above average by analysts and  investors.

**ROA** (Return On Assets): shows how profitable a  company’s assets are in generating revenue. It’s a useful number for  comparing competing companies in the same industry. The higher the ROA  number, the better, because the company is earning more money on less  investment. ROAs over 5 are generally considered good.

**ROE** (Return ON Equity): measures the profitability of  a business in relation to the equity. ROEs of at least 15–20 are  generally considered good. Whereas ROE compares net income to the net  assets of the company, ROA compares net income to the company’s assets  alone, without deducting its liabilities. Sometimes an extremely high  ROE is a good thing if net income is extremely large compared to equity  because a company’s performance is so strong. However, an extremely high  ROE is often due to a small equity account compared to net income,  which indicates risk.

**Net Margin** (Net Profit Margin): Net profit margin or  net margin is the percentage of net income generated from a company’s  revenue. Net income is often called the bottom line for a company or the  net profit. It helps investors assess if a company’s management is  generating enough profit from its sales and whether operating costs and  overhead costs are being contained. Net profit margin can be influenced  by one-off items such as the sale of an asset, which would temporarily  boost profits.

**EPS** (Earnings Per Share): calculated as net income  (also known as profits or earnings) divided by available shares. The  resulting number serves as an indicator of a company’s profitability.  The higher a company’s EPS, the more profitable it is considered to be.  What counts as a “good” EPS will depend on factors such as the recent  performance of the company, the performance of its competitors, and the  expectations of the analysts who follow the stock. Sometimes, a company  might report growing EPS, but the stock might decline in price if  analysts were expecting an even higher number.

**Quick ratio**: a ratio between quickly available or  liquid assets and current liabilities. A company with a quick ratio of  less than 1 cannot currently fully pay back its current liabilities. In  general, the higher the ratio, the greater the company’s liquidity.

**Current ratio**: a liquidity ratio that measures  whether a company has enough resources to meet its short-term  obligations. It compares a firm’s current assets to its current  liabilities. Acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry.  In many cases, a creditor would consider a high current ratio to be  better than a low current ratio, because a high current ratio indicates  that the company is more likely to pay the creditor back. Large current  ratios are not always a good sign for investors. If the company’s  current ratio is too high it may indicate that the company is not  efficiently using its current assets or its short-term financing  facilities.

**D/E** (Debt to Equity ratio): used to evaluate a  company’s financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s  total liabilities by its shareholder equity. In other words, it measures  the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt  versus wholy owned funds. Higher-leverage ratios tend to indicate a  company or stock with higher risk to shareholders. What counts as a  “good” debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio will depend on the nature of the  business and its industry. Generally speaking, a D/E ratio below 1.0  would be seen as relatively safe, whereas ratios of 2.0 or higher would  be considered risky.

**LTDebt/Eq** (Long Term Debt to Equity ratio):  calculated by taking the company’s long-term debt and dividing it by the  book value of common equity. Similar to D/E, but long term debt is  applied there (debt that matures in more than one year).

**PEG** (price/earnings to growth ratio): a valuation  metric for determining the relative trade-off between the price of a  stock, the earnings generated per share (EPS), and the company’s  expected growth. PEG is a widely employed indicator of a stock’s  possible true value. Similar to PE ratios, a lower PEG means that the  stock is undervalued more. It is favored by many over the price/earnings  ratio because it also accounts for growth. Criticisms of the PEG ratio  include that it is an oversimplified ratio that fails to usefully relate  the price/earnings ratio to growth because it fails to factor in return  on equity (ROE) or similar factors. On the other hand, the PEG ratio  can offer a suggestion of whether a company’s high P/E ratio reflects an  excessively high stock price or is a reflection of promising growth  prospects for the company.

**P/S** (Price to Sales ratio): a valuation ratio that  shows a company’s market capitalization divided by the company’s sales  for the previous 12 months. It is a measure of the value investors are  receiving from a company’s stock by indicating how much are they are  paying for the stock per dollar of the company’s sales. Analysts prefer  to see a lower number for the ratio. A ratio of less than 1 indicates  that investors are paying less than $1 per $1 of the company’s sales.  Any number higher than 4 is commonly considered unfavorable.

**Gross margin**: a difference between revenue and cost  of goods sold (COGS), divided by revenue. In other words, it is the  sales revenue a company retains after incurring the direct costs  associated with producing the goods it sells, and the services it  provides. The higher the gross margin, the more capital a company  retains on each dollar of sales, which it can then use to pay other  costs or satisfy debt obligations.

**Piotroski F-Score**: a discrete score between zero and  nine that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a  firm’s financial position. The Piotroski Score is used to determine the  best value stocks, with nine being the best and zero being the worst.

**Altman Z-Score**: the output of a credit-strength test  that gauges a publicly-traded manufacturing company’s likelihood of  bankruptcy. It uses profitability, leverage, liquidity, solvency, and  activity to predict whether a company has a high probability of becoming  insolvent. A score below 1.8 means it’s likely the company is headed  for bankruptcy, while companies with scores above 3 are not likely to go  bankrupt. Investors can use Altman Z-scores to determine whether they  should buy or sell a stock if they’re concerned about the company’s  underlying financial strength. Investors may consider purchasing a stock  if its Altman Z-Score value is closer to 3 and selling or shorting a  stock if the value is closer to 1.8.

**Div Yield** (Dividend Yield): a ratio (dividend/price)  that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative  to its stock price.

**Payout ratio**: a financial metric showing the  proportion of earnings a company pays its shareholders in the form of  dividends, expressed as a percentage of the company’s total earnings.

**Beta**: a measure of a stock’s volatility in relation  to the overall market. By definition, the market, such as the S&amp;P  500 Index, has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according  to how much they deviate from the market. A stock that swings more than  the market over time has a beta above 1.0. If a stock moves less than  the market, the stock’s beta is less than 1.0. High-beta stocks are  supposed to be riskier but provide higher return potential; low-beta  stocks pose less risk but also lower returns.

**Volatility**: represents how large an asset’s prices swing around the mean price.

**MRQ**: Most Recent Quarter.

**TTM**: Trailing Twelve Months.

**Volume**: the total number of shares that are actually traded (bought and sold) during a period of time.

China´s interest on developing these natios is strong for both, political and economical reasons. 

It will take some time yes, but i think africa can play a major role as a solution for logistics disruptions we are facing today in logistics; just think about the position in the map they play. Really it is pretty near of every major major market

25,investing,XorFish,Internal Rate of Return for investments in ARKK compared with the Total US Market based on Fund Flows,"[etf.com](https://etf.com) has data on fund flows. I used the data for ARKK and simulated how the average investor in ARKK would have fared compared with investing in a Total Market ETF.

I imported every daily net fund flow in [Portfolio Performance](https://www.portfolio-performance.info/) and invested it into VTI or ARKK based on historic prices from yahoo finance.

I didn't include any Dividends. However that doesn't change much because most of the fund flows occurred in the last two years.

The annualized true time weighted rate of return  for ARKK is a very high 28.1% compared with 11.6% for the Total Market. However the average dollar invested in ARKK did worse than if it were invested into a total market ETF.

The IRR for ARKK is 21.6% while the IRR for VTI is 25.1%.

Here is the result, value is in million USD:

36,investing,Spirited-Pause,New home construction has soared to its highest level since July 2007,"[https://www.axios.com/home-construction-levels-dc2bd3ac-3b36-43e2-b24e-bd686c09f3d3.html](https://www.axios.com/home-construction-levels-dc2bd3ac-3b36-43e2-b24e-bd686c09f3d3.html)

 

&gt;The number of new homes under construction has soared — to levels not seen since the housing market crash 14 years ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Why it matters:** Home prices have been [surging](https://www.axios.com/consumers-complain-high-prices-inflation-2143e88c-84a3-4908-9861-8dd1571636dd.html) as the demand for houses has [outpaced supply](https://www.axios.com/housing-demand-outpacing-supply-construction-816e1c64-d164-4cfd-9b83-9f40b3079b36.html). Homebuilders are doing what they can to keep up, but supply chain bottlenecks have led some to [turn away buyers](https://www.axios.com/home-sales-construction-demand-dr-horton-805c6f47-c8c4-46ee-96a6-3b0fcd330365.html) as they try to catch up.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Driving the news:** There were 689,000 single-family homes [under construction](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/index.html) in July, the highest number since July 2007.  
&gt;  
&gt;""This  is clearly a positive sign given the remarkably low levels of inventory  on the market,"" Mortgage Bankers Association chief economist Mike  Fratantoni says.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Yes, but:** While the large  number likely means more new homebuyers will soon be able to move in, it  may also reflect the fact that it’s taking increasingly [longer](https://nahbnow.com/2021/08/builder-confidence-at-13-month-low-on-higher-material-costs-home-prices/) to complete a home.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I  expect there have been delays in construction, and that is why there  are so many ‘under construction,'"" Bill McBride, housing economist at  Calculated Risk, tells Axios.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The lack of building materials,  ready-to-build on lots, and labor shortages are slowing housing growth,""  Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda Economics, tells Axios.  
&gt;  
&gt;This explains why the number of homes under construction is up even as the [pace of housing starts slows](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-housing-starts-fall-sharply-july-2021-08-18/).  
&gt;  
&gt;**State of play:** As of June, [new homes](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf)  were being sold at an annualized rate of 676,000, a number that’s come  down from a high of 993,000 in January due to supply constraints.  
&gt;  
&gt;An unusually high [76.6%](https://www.axios.com/housing-demand-outpacing-supply-construction-816e1c64-d164-4cfd-9b83-9f40b3079b36.html) of new homes sold were either still under construction or not yet started.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the supply of new homes has been ticking higher, completed homes represented a [record low](https://twitter.com/RenMacLLC/status/1419668494816264193) 10.2% of this supply.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The big picture:** It may be tempting to draw comparisons to the housing bubble, but that may be a mistake.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Builders  adjust their sales strategy depending on where the market is,"" Wolf  explains. ""For example, during the mid-2000s housing boom, builders  started a lot of speculative building to get ahead of the demand.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Following  the crash, builders pivoted more towards a built-to-order model where  they would wait for a buyer to start most of their homes,"" she says.  ""The high number of homes under construction is partly telling us that  builders are building homes that they already have under contract.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**The bottom line:**  While the elevated level of construction raises warning flags, evidence  suggests it is more reflective of delays than frenzied speculative  building.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Since most of these are already sold, I don't think we are overbuilding, or that this will impact prices,"" McBride says.",1629462652,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p848ug/new_home_construction_has_soared_to_its_highest/
42,investing,Mr_Googar,What do you think will be the largest company in the world by 2050?," 

\- Does it even exist yet?

\- What industry are they in?

\- Why will they be the largest?

I think Tesla, I know, original but everything points in that way for the company. They are growing at an astounding rate despite their size and are still looking to increase production of there vehicles 50% yoy for at least the next decade. Which would put them around 20 Mil by 2030.

That's just the surface, Elon has publicly stated that be believes that the energy side of Tesla's business (solar, batteries, etc) will be worth the same if not more then the automotive side.

I don't think that will be the most exciting part of tesla's business and today it was confirmed. The AI component of Tesla's business (self driving cars/robotics) will be the largest of them all. Ark invest projects that global revenue for autonomous cars and services could exceed 10 trillion by 2035, and I think Tesla will have a outsized chunk of this pie.

As a Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate, the things I see this company producing are just beyond astonishing, go watch Sandy Munro talk about Tesla's innovation, watch battery day and AI day and tell me that this won't be the biggest company in the world. They are innovating on things other companies have barely started and are doing at an accelerating rate.

From an investment standpoint it's a no brainer.

Just Imagine,

\- creating your own AI chip in house because NIVDIA's are not good enough

\- creating your own batteries in house because Panasonic's are not good enough

\- creating a new alloy so you can megacast half of the structure of a car in 10ms

Initially held LVGO shares, that got acquired by TDOC. May be should have gotten out at that point, but that's hindsight.. TDOC is down quite a bit this year from all time high of ~300. I plan to hold it for couple years, but not sure if that's a good decision. Inputs? Not sure if average down is a good idea either.. looks like membership growth is not quite encouraging.

Last week saw the newest second-quarter earnings release from Teladoc Health, Inc. ( NYSE:TDOC ). The company posted revenues in line with expectations, at US$503m, while statutory losses ballooned to US$0.86 per share.

Teladoc is mitigating the expenses caused by the acquisition of Livongo Health, Inc. around a year ago. Net loss was US$(333.5)m for the first half of 2021 compared to US$(55.3)m for the first half of 2020. The second quarter and first half of 2021 include stock-based compensation expense of US$83m and US$169.3m, respectively, an increase of US$61m and US$129m, respectively, from the second quarter and first half of 2020, substantially reflecting higher expense associated with Livongo stock awards that continue to vest after the merger. It is clear that integrating a US$15.9b dollar project will have some medium term lasting implications and shareholders can only hope that this big move pays off down the line.",1629432880,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p7uugc/how_does_this_sub_feel_about_tdoc/

86,investing,scarberia123,"Regenerative medicine nears banner year with $14.1B cash infusion, regulatory milestones and a well-stocked pipeline","For a long time, gene and cell therapies were a treatment option for the future. Now, the pace of development is moving at breakneck speed, with a number of firsts and $14.1 billion in financing collected over the initial half of the year.

The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine has documented the “acceleration on all fronts” in a new report looking at the first half of 2021.

Most notably was Intellia’s demonstration of CRISPR gene-editing in humans through phase 1 data for patients with transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. But that’s not all for regenerative medicine, which includes cell and gene therapies, gene editing and tissue-based therapies.

Companies developing these therapies have collected $14.1 billion in the first half alone, which is 71% of what was raised during all of 2020. The alliance called this surge the strongest half on record. 2020 already broke financing records, with $20 billion, and the report suggests 2021 could exceed that total.

Cell-based immuno-oncology has for the first time surpassed gene therapy in financing, notching $6.6 billion compared to $6.4 billion, respectively. The broader category of cell therapy, including stem cell treatments for Parkinson's disease, meanwhile picked up $1.1 billion.

Regulatory milestones

Gene therapies and gene-modified cell therapy products are on track to notch the highest annual number of regulatory approvals. Three have already been approved. Bluebird bio’s Skysona nabbed an EU nod for the rare neuromuscular disease cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy. Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird’s multiple myeloma CAR-T drug Abecma was cleared by the FDA in late March. And Bristol Myers’ long-awaited CAR-T liso-cel, now called Breyanzi, was approved in February.

Waiting in the regulatory queue in the U.S. and EU is Johnson &amp; Johnson and Legend Bio’s cilta-cel in multiple myeloma, which will compete with Abecma. Other companies have approvals pending around the world.

Even with these approvals, however, cell and gene therapies face hurdles once they are cleared for the market. Bluebird bio, for instance, has pulled back from European markets after failing to reach a consensus on pricing for the one-time treatment Zynteglo.

The pipeline is nevertheless filled to the brim with new therapies. The report counted 1,320 industry-sponsored trials underway worldwide, including 158 that are in phase 3. Academic and other research is responsible for an additional 1,328 non-industry trials including 85 late-stage studies.

Indications run the gamut of diseases, but are mostly concentrated in oncology for the industry-sponsored trials, followed by central nervous system (CNS) disorders and rare genetic diseases. Academic research similarly focuses on oncology, followed by infectious diseases and CNS.

CAR-T therapies, which take a patients’ own cells and power them up to fight cancer before being returned to the body, have been particularly dominate in R&amp;D. Abecma is one example, but the J&amp;J-Legend cilta-cel showed some promising data in June, with a 98% overall response rate in multiple myeloma. The therapy is currently being reviewed by EU and U.S. regulators, with a decision expected later this year.


More readouts are expected from Precision BioSciences and CRISPR Therapeutics, which are working on separate BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapies.

The alliance counts 566 companies as developing regenerative medicines and advanced therapies in the U.S. and 588 industry-sponsored trials with U.S. sites.

One of the sayings of David Gardner of The Motley Fool. If youre a day trader or short term investor you need to remember that the stock market ALWAYS goes down

Seriously. You can take that and test it. By any stock. Any of them. And nine times out of 10 no matter when you bought it- will be in the red by the end of the week

Stocks always go down. They say not to buy high and sell low but you're always buying high. At any moment you're buying a stock higher than it will be later in that week.. because in the short term they always go down. So it's impossible NOT to buy a stock high

And in many cases impossible not to sell it low. There's plenty of examples of a stock that never goes back up no matter how long you hold it. Look at tesla. It was steadily increasing for months until it hit $840 before it dropped. For anyone trying to follow the ""advice"" of ""just hold it"" instead of cutting their losses they would have lost tons of money and it never went back up..

More examples how it's impossible not to buy high and often times impossible not to sell low

The only times you can actually make money is if you hold it for a very long time. And being that it's impossible to beat the market you generally won't see that much rate of return. Unless you prove to be a better investor than the experts at Wall Street then the chances of making any serious money unless you already invested serious money would be pretty low. You have to have at least a few million dollars in the stock market to reliably make anything tangible..",1629395334,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p7jum6/remember_the_stock_market_almost_always_goes_down/

Recent news- GoHealth and GoodRx Announce Exclusive Medicare Agreement

CHICAGO and SANTA MONICA, Calif., Aug. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- GoHealth, Inc. (GoHealth) (NASDAQ: GOCO), a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company, and GoodRx, Inc. (NASDAQ: GDRX), America's leading resource for healthcare savings, today announced an exclusive agreement to bring GoHealth's Medicare enrollment and engagement solutions directly to GoodRx users on the GoodRx platform.

Of the nearly 20 million people who come to GoodRx every month looking for savings, millions of them have Medicare, based on GoodRx's internal analysis, while many others qualify for the program each year as they age in. GoodRx consumers who want to explore Medicare coverage options and understand potential benefits or savings will be able to access information about GoHealth's market-leading Medicare plan selection solutions. Those who enroll in a Medicare plan through GoHealth have access to a suite of healthcare services to further improve health outcomes. For instance, GoHealth members will receive ongoing engagement and education around pharmacy options and prescription savings related to their Medicare Advantage plan to maximize the value of their prescription plan benefits.

GoHealth consumers will also have access to GoodRx prescription discounts on GoHealth's Encompass platform. GoodRx prescription discounts can provide savings of up to 80% from the pharmacy retail price and are accepted at over 70,000 pharmacies nationwide, including Albertsons, CVS, Kroger, Rite Aid, Walmart and Walgreens.

""We're excited to bring GoodRx into GoHealth's robust ecosystem of strategic partners. Prescription costs are a major financial barrier for many people, especially Medicare members, and GoodRx's platform is greatly beneficial to finding savings for our members. Through this strategic partnership, we are giving our members affordable choices to further improve health outcomes, while also helping GoodRx's users find and enroll in the right Medicare coverage plan that fits their needs, a real win-win,"" said Ben Miller, Senior Vice President, Strategic Partnerships at GoHealth.

GoodRx is one of the many strategic partners GoHealth has added to its Encompass technology, a proprietary engagement platform that maximizes members' utilization of their benefits once enrolled in a plan, ensuring that members receive the care they need. This agreement is part of GoHealth's ongoing commitment to improve access to healthcare in America.

""The strategic partnership with GoHealth adds critical information to our platform that helps users as they seek to understand and navigate the complex world of Medicare,"" said Doug Hirsch, co-CEO and co-founder of GoodRx. ""The level of Medicare expertise and service that GoHealth provides, combined with our prescription savings value proposition, creates immense value all around.""

Although GOCO missed pretty bad on EPS last quarter their revenues have GROWN BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS 2018 rev's $226M\*\*, FYE 2021 rev's $1.01B\*\*

**Last reported cash on hand (recent) $112M**

**Last reported short % of float 8.52%**

**Book value per share $4.47**

**Qurterly revenue growth YOY 55%**

**Quote from the recent Earnings report**

Clint Jones, co-founder and CEO said, ""GoHealth's second quarter revenue growth of 55% was driven by an 84% gain in our Medicare—Internal segment with LTVs expanding 5%. Our ramped up investments in our Encompass Platform led to $17 million in revenue contribution from the platform's additional services beyond enrollment for carriers. Given the 50% top-line growth over the first six months and continued strength in the market, **we have raised and tightened our revenue expectations for full year fiscal 2021.""**

**52 week low $4**

**52 week high $19.50**

61,investing,Many-Coach6987,Your input on the evaluation of successful firms in strong bearish times,"Hi all,
 
I have a question that I can’t wrap my head around. It is with regards to a fair (I know it’s subjective tho) evaluation of a firm in difficult times.
 
Let’s take Biontech. Currently P/E in the 10s?! They will reap billions over the next years from COVID vaccines and their technology will likely lead to other innovations so let’s assume they grow 15% annually over the next 10 years. Their P/E would be around the same, maybe 20 (other indicators deem a fair valuation too) all that time.
 
In 6 years the markets crash for whatever reason and because everything does, so does the stock price of Biontech. But people still have diseases and revenue comes in. 
 
If the price plunges 50% with stable earnings/revenues……Would you agree with my conclusions:
 
1)     Biontech would be subject to an overcorrection leading to an undervaluation (P/E would be even lower), therefore likely to bounce back to some degree
2)     However the bounce back would only happen, if the markets loose the irrational emotions and stop panic selling. When that is over, the market will see the undervaluation and buy the stock
 
BUT: I just wonder for how long that could go. Is it possible, or being more precise, are there known examples where the markets have been low for a long time and with that the value of firms who do exceptionally well? That would be irrational.

I am asking since it makes sense to me to hold Biontech long term…10-15 years surely. But if a crash would come around and drag Biontech with it, I rather sell and take profits instead of buying the dips…because of the risk (however real that risk would be?!) that it takes forever to bounce back….
 
Hope this made sense and I am grateful for your thoughts.",1629380659,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p7f451/your_input_on_the_evaluation_of_successful_firms/

The crackdown wiped off nearly $1 trillion of market value from Chinese shares listed globally last month as it quickly expanded from antitrust and e-commerce concerns to private tutoring, data security and online content. Alibaba’s shares have slumped 29% this year compared to a fall of just under 7% for the Hang Seng Index. 

The selloff has prompted some global fund managers including Cathie Wood to dump their holdings in Chinese stocks over the past few months. In fact, some investors are questioning allocations toward Chinese assets altogether.

The new moves are incremental but investors are not at a point where they “will cease to price in any more additional policies,” said Shine Gao, fund manager at Taicheng Capital Management Co. “Even if the worst is over for big tech firms in terms of new regulations, we should expect that their growth won’t be what it was.”

""The TFD Initiative, whose members include major global financial institutions and leading service providers such as ABN AMRO, Santander Asset Management, ING Bank, SMBC, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Texel Group, NN Investment Partners and more, recognises the vital role blockchain will play in shaping the future of the trade finance sector, which has already been successfully implemented in other areas of finance.

A first-of-its-kind, public-private hybrid blockchain platform, XDC Network brings energy-efficient smart contract and digital asset technology to the trade investment class.

Chris Southworth, Secretary General, ICC United Kingdom who is an observer on TFD Initiative said: ""Trade finance is a compelling asset class for institutional investors. Making trade finance more accessible for non-bank investors is of paramount importance if we are going to drive the economic recovery from Covid and fill the USD 3-5 trillion SME trade finance gap. Innovative technology driven solutions like the TFD Initiative are a critical part of the solution to providing more liquidity into the market.""

Leveraging the power of cryptographic tokens, the XDC Network allows for the digitisation, tokenisation, and swift settlement of trade transactions, reducing reliance on complex foreign exchange infrastructures. Some of the key advantages include lower transaction fees (near zero), less energy consumption, efficient confirmation time, double validation, and randomisation for security guarantees.""",1629296053,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p6rzhu/xinfins_xdc_network_selected_as_the_first/

39,investing,wallstjunky,My Thoughts On The NFT Craze,"  

Today as I sipped my coffee in my backyard I was keeping my ear to the streets as I normally do in the latest financial gossip. I’ve recently heard about the new craze that is seemingly lingering longer than I thought it would. Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are being ushered into the millennial and zoomer populations by creatively bankrupt Hollywood has-beens and noteworthy celebrities. Lindsay Lohan and other bold innovators of the investor class like Soulja Boy and Mark Cuban. Both of them are well known for their reliable and professional investment advice and business savvy. Cuban who has recently been an avid promoter of the Wallstreet bets pump and dump movement and Soulja Boy who was recently sued by Nintendo over his cheap Chinese knock-off video game consoles violated more than a dozen copyright laws. 

Honestly, my first impression of these NFT’s is a bit on the cynical side. Perhaps it is just my overactive imagination paired with a sense of dark humor. But I truly see people buying these NFT’s as a sign of the apocalypse. The concept wasn’t totally foreign to me. Video gamers have been using digital inventory for real-world currency for a long time. Online communities tend to have websites that facilitate in real-world trade of money for in-game items or digital loot drops from other players. Online trading card games have had digital copies of rare cards that are commonly traded for money too. Online party hats in a video game called Runescape sold for 7 thousand USD between private sellers. But are we really at a stage in the economic cycle where the best course of action is to buy digital content to pad your portfolio? 

Are we really at a moment in history where people are actually purchasing a Lindsey Lohan NFT for 17 thousand dollars? Is dancing GIFS of Mark Cuban to your portfolio really going to be a solid item for your child’s financial future? Will AMC one day let us pay for our movies with Zuckerberg GIFs or pre-expulsion Trump Tweets? Will canceled celebrities have to sell their NFTs in shady alleys and on street corners within flash drives? I don’t truly know and I don’t want to pretend to know the answer. While it’s really easy to cherry-pick from the dregs of the Hollywood influencer types. There is real money being moved by major players in the digital market. A GIF of a cat-poptart hybrid called “Nyan-Cat” sold for 450 thousand dollars and Kings of Leon’s album sold for 6 million dollars respectively. 

In both instances, the content is already released to the public. The owners don’t collect any revenue or royalties anytime the GIFs are used or the albums are played. In fact, the only thing gained is a sense of ownership within our digital world. While the world stands on the brink of opening up, the flood of money into online and virtual assets is staggering. Why buy real estate when you can buy virtual real estate? There was an old saying by Mark Twain. “Buy land, they aren’t making any more of it.” I can’t help but reflect on that as I see more and more of the virtual space be paved. How much farther into technology is society really trying to dive in and how much are people really willing to invest into this frontier? 

On one level this seems to be a desperate attempt for people with influence to make money from their followers by truly trying to offer them the clout of virtual asset ownership instead of conventionally making products to sell to them. On another level, this is pop culture and pop art manifesting its own free market. I don’t believe the Government will get involved yet in a major capacity on either side of the pendulum either. I think the government trying to restrict the sale of virtual art is about as likely as them releasing their own NFTs of what’s within area 51 or who killed JFK. 

But on another level, I also think that NFTs are a way where people can support their content creators and help support them in more meaningful ways beyond a tip. Instead of donations and handouts, people are now able to get collectibles and memorabilia that might hold and maintain some value as opposed to nothing. We live in a world where artists and entertainers stream a variety of content to their fans and audiences. The idea that the words we utter, the pictures we take, and our online memories can all be bought and sold are a new chapter in this digital economy. In today’s day and age, you’re money.",1629253205,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p6i26a/my_thoughts_on_the_nft_craze/

1. Instead of players like BYND who exclusively focus on it, big ones like Chipotle, YUM foods focusing on vegan alternatives are worth an investment.

2. *Flexitarianism* is on the rise, the trend is here to stay. The reliance on animal products needs to lessen in the wake of climate change, this is no fad, it's a growing and inevitable industry.

3. Canada has some good players - VRYYF, MLFNF. Eat beyond (EATS, EATBF) is a canadian equity firm which has positions in this space. I've been tracking it for a while, it's done poorly this year - https://i.imgur.com/Kw1ybTz.png

TurtleTree | $200,200
Nabati Foods | $250,000

VRYYF only 3%

good natured 7%

eat just 14%

turtletree 14%

nabati 17%

singcell 10%.

&gt;A major part of this decline has come in July 2021, mainly due to caution on the part of investors on the foodservice sector amidst resurgence in Covid-positive cases. The spread of the Delta variant has also led to fear and uncertainty regarding re-imposition of lockdowns

I'm in a situation with a masters program application a couple months from now where I'll need to prove I have a certain amount of money via a bank statement. Basically since tuition is free in this country (Norway) they require you to provide bank statements showing that you have enough money to support yourself (they won't accept brokerage accounts). I have more than enough money saved and invested, I just don't want to make a taxable event by selling assets simply to get cash in my account, pull a statement, and then put it right back in the brokerage. An alternative I found sounds tempting: withdraw contributions from my Roth IRA, get it in my checking account temporarily, then put it right back in the Roth. From what I've read, this is considered a ""rollover"" into the same account and is okay with the IRS so long as it's returned within 60 days. So my question is, is this a reasonable alternative to get cash in my account temporarily, or is there something I'm missing that may bite me in the ass?

Disclaimer: I know someone will say that I should sell the assets now if I intend to use them in the near future, and you're not wrong. But at my current savings rate I will have the required amount saved by the time I need it, and I'd rather have this money keep working for me in the meantime.

If you did not know a Series EE bonds is suppose to double in value in 20 years. The rates are pretty low for these bonds. The earliest bonds I have is 1996 going all the way to 2011. Some bonds are close to maturity where others basically have very little interest. Final Maturity for a 2011 bond is around 2041 meaning ill be 45 years old.

It’s about $6,500. We plan on buying a house in about 3-5 years. I like to use SoFi for investments and like their automated investing feature. Do you think it would be wise to keep our wedding funds into a conservative account, rather than just sit in a normal bank account which is losing due to inflation?

I originally had it in a moderately conservative account which is 30% stocks, 70% bonds but noticed I was losing money due to the current market. For this particular account, I’m not comfortable with too much risk or the prospect of losing more than I gain. So I switched it to 100% bonds. 

Was this a wise choice to put our house savings into a lower risk investment account rather than just have it sit in a regular bank account?

If they can  continue to buy the small to mid-size market with absurdly low IaaS  costs, high quality documentation, and simple automation tools, they  will have at least 30% YoY revenue growth for several years to come.

22,investing,No_Try_5797,The Biggest Misconception about Investing,"I posted this the other day on r/StockMarket and r/ValueInvesting got wonderful responses so I thought I’d share it here too. Now, I understand that some of you may have already seen this if you follow either subs (I couldn’t post here because I didn’t have enough karma). I share it fully acknowledging that fact. Nonetheless, I do think some of the points below can be beneficial for some people.

## Key points:

* A lot of everyday investors make investment decisions without understanding what they’re really investing in. Most people speculate, don't be most people.
* Investing is an informed decision on the basis that your shares (or any other asset) will one day earn more money, and therefore be worth more, than what you paid for it; Not the other way around.
* Invest like a landlord. If you choose to invest in a company, you should follow earnings of your shares as if you were a landlord collecting rent, quarter by quarter I recommend using owner’s earnings. After all, they are your earnings.
* Investing in individual companies is well worth it as long as you adopt the right mindset. The earnings automatically come to you, you have extremely capable and smart people literally making money for you, and you are taxed less than your income!

## Investment guidance is fragmented and confusing

The investing space is highly fragmented, filled with a dubious amount of noise &amp; misinformation, and can be downright confusing. But investing at its core is straightforward. With the proper knowledge and framework, you can accumulate a lifetime of wealth.

## What is investing?

Investing is the act of foregoing a dollar today to get more dollars tomorrow... plain and simple. It is an informed decision, based on logic and facts, on the premise that the asset you're investing in will produce valuable goods and services that will one day exceed what you paid for to acquire the asset. This applies to all sorts of investments — stocks, property, bonds, a cornfield, etc. Regardless of the asset, investing remains the same throughout. In the context of stocks, this is reflected in their earnings, i.e. how much will company earn for the duration of your investment.

## What investing is not

Investing is not buying an asset in hopes that someone else will buy it for more than you paid for. In the context of stocks, investing has nothing to do with how much the price of a stock has gone up or down and trying to sell at it's peak. Banking on someone more [foolish](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVroao_K3yAhVb7nMBHUtJAmEQFnoECBEQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fterms%2Fg%2Fgreaterfooltheory.asp&amp;usg=AOvVaw1LHhubcsWAa0-XwEi5S6MT) to buy subpar and unproductive assets from you is speculative and unsustainable. This is gambling not investing — a recipe for disaster.

Likewise, statements such as “the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up"" or ""Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy"" are worthless. This is wishful thinking and is lazy. Companies make money because they produce goods and services people are willing to pay for and have structural advantages that make them preferable to their competitors and therefore earn more.

Investing in a stock is not buying a piece of paper hoping the sucker goes up nor is it some form of wishful thinking. Most people think like this and lose money. Don't be most people.

## Become a landlord

To become a good investor, you must think like a landlord. What I mean by this is just like a landlord keeps track and collects his rent every month, you must track and total the earnings of your shares. Understand where they come from and ignore how much your shares have gone up or down. When the value of your property falls 10%, you don’t sell it. You look at your rents and whether or not your rents has also been negatively affected. The same applies for stocks.

And the best part? You don’t have to do any work such as maintaining, marketing and, selling your property as long as you do proper research. Your earnings are reported automatically, you don’t have to collect them, or worry if people pay late. Why would you not invest if every time Apple sold an iPhone, a percentage of that money goes to you?!

*A few of you might think that you should just track dividends because dividends are what you're receiving. This is misguided. You must track the totality of earnings as some earnings will be retained to reinvest in the business and grow future earnings. This figure is known as owner's earnings and can be calculated relatively easily. More on this next time.*

## Many people speculate, few invest

Investing is pretty simple to understand, but difficult to execute. The first step to becoming a good investor is to start thinking like one and stop speculating all together. Statistically and anecdotally speaking, most retail investors fall into the speculative camp. This, by the way, extends to ""long-term investors"" who, in their best intentions, invest in companies in industries they believe to be the ""future"" but aren't able to pinpoint the earnings and returns of the companies they're investing in. If you're not going to track your returns, the money that you are earning/accumulating as a shareholder every quarter, and your subsequent yield then do not invest in individual stocks. Doing so is not investing! It is merely wishful thinking clouded by euphoria and misguided beliefs.

Instead, invest in an ETF that mirrors the S&amp;P 500 every month, do not touch it and let your money compound over time. It will provide satisfactory returns... much better returns than most investment vehicles.

However, I would really urge you to consider investing in individual companies. It is well worth it (this [chart](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaways-investing-returns-a-breakdown-by-numbers-51582633800) says it all\].) I might make a post on why you should invest in individual companies and how to figure out what companies are worth investing in or not. Let me know if you’re interested.

*Also, if any of you can suggest which other subs could benefit from this post, please let me know. I’d love to engage in a conversation across multiple subs.*",1629204002,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p62yhv/the_biggest_misconception_about_investing/

The home improvement retailer also didn’t provide a full-year outlook in its earnings release.

While Home Depot’s quarterly profit and revenue beat Wall Street estimates, same-store sales came in slightly below expectations as the company lapped a period a year earlier when customers flocked to its stores to buy paint, wood, gardening supplies and other materials for home remodelling projects.

U.S. same-store sales were up just 3.4% in the latest quarter, compared with a 25% jump in the year-ago period.

Here’s how the company did for its fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

\- Earnings per share: $4.53 vs. $4.44 expected

\- Revenue: $41.12 billion vs. $40.79 billion expected

For the three months ended Aug. 1, net income grew to $4.81 billion, or $4.53 per share, from $4.33 billion, or $4.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had been looking for $4.44 per share, according to a Refinitiv survey.

Revenue climbed 8.1% to $41.12 billion from $38.05 billion a year earlier. That topped expectations for $40.79 billion.

Total same-store sales rose 4.5%. That was short of the more than 5% growth anticipated from analysts polled by StreetAccount.

The company reported a 5.8% drop in customer transactions compared with a year earlier, but the average ticket was 11.3% larger. Sales per retail square foot grew 5.3% year over year to $663.05.

Inflation could be one factor boosting sales. Analysts say lumber prices peaked during the latest quarter.

Home Depot faces tough comparisons with a year earlier when its brick-and-mortar stores remained open during the pandemic, and many Americans invested in remodelling projects. Home Depot’s revenue growth is expected to slow in 2021.",1629199437,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p61tl5/home_depot_shares_tumble_despite_earnings_beat/

Burry initiated the new position by buying $31 million worth of puts in the ARKK ETF.

Burry's not the only one, as the Disruptive Innovation ETF has a 30-day put-to-call ratio of 1.8, meaning more people are buying bearish put options on the fund than bullish call options.

Other investors are outright shorting shares of the ETF, with short interest currently sitting at a record high 11.63%, according to data from Koyfin. With 21.58 million shares sold short as of Friday, the bet against ARK Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF now totals $2.6 billion. 		

Burry's bet against ARK is likely tied to his conviction that Tesla is a short, given that Scion Asset Management's largest position is a $731 million put position in the electric vehicle manufacturer, representing a whopping 35% of his fund's more than $2 billion in assets under management. Burry increased his bet against Tesla by 34% in the second-quarter. 

Tesla remains Ark Invests largest position by a significant margin, with it making up nearly 11% of the ARKK ETF as of Friday.

China’s market regulator issued draft rules on Tuesday aimed at stopping unfair competition on the internet, as Beijing continues its broad crack down on the country’s technology sector.

The rules published by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) cover a wide range of areas from prohibitions on the way companies can use data to stamping out fake product reviews.

Chinese listed technology stocks in Hong Kong fell sharply on that news. Gaming giant Tencent was 3.5% lower in late morning trade, while e-commerce giant Alibaba fell 2.5%.

SAMR’s latest rules continue Beijing’s regulatory assault on China’s technology giants.

Here are some of the other key rules outlined:

Operators should not provide false data, such as the number of clicks on a piece of content;
Operators should not conceal negative reviews and only promote positive reviews;
Internet platforms should not use data, algorithms and other technical means to influence user choices, or other methods to carry out so-called traffic hijacking. This is where a company looks to redirect a user to their own website or service while they’re browsing another;
Operators should not use data and algorithms to collect and analyze competitors’ trading information.
SAMR said it could hire third-party institutions to audit data if an operator falls foul of the rules.

SAMR said it could hire third-party institutions to audit data if an operator falls foul of the rules.

The regulator is seeking public opinion on the new rules until Sept. 15. They have not yet come into effect.

However, SAMR’s draft rules highlight the market regulator’s push to tighten the laws around antitrust and competition. Earlier this year, the authority promulgated antitrust guidelines for the so-called platform economy.

The regulator has also been taking action against China’s technology giants.

Alibaba was slapped with a $2.8 billion fine in April as a result of an anti-monopoly probe, and SAMR is currently investigating food delivery firm Meituan for “suspected monopolistic practices.”

And last month, the SAMR blocked Tencent’s plan to merge video game streaming sites Huya and DouYu on antitrust concerns.",1629182049,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p5yd33/china_seeks_to_tighten_rules_on_unfair_internet/
58,investing,the_ITman,[HELP] me identify this scam! Or is it not a scam? Too good to be true!,"Few months ago my friend was referred to this broker through another friend. The broker is Dave Clarkson (working for an investment firm called [The Investment Center](https://investmentcenter.co.uk/), UK).

She sent him $5,000 3 months ago and he helped set her up a Binance account, which he manages. She also has access to this Binance account. Today she has hit $15,000 on that account. I was stumped at this 300% return so on questioning her further she says that almost everybody who is investing through this broker, which is a majority of her friend group, is making massive returns.

For example, one of her close friends took a loan of $40,000 at the start of this year, and is now regularly withdrawing $20,000 every month since past 3 months.

Another close friend of hers in the same friend group is profiting more than $100,000 a year through Dave Clarkson.

She said I should invest too, so I started doing my due research online. I found out they are not registered with [FCA UK](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/investment-center).

Using my web development background, I found there are 2 other exactly similar websites to the [Investment Center UK website](https://investmentcenter.co.uk/) (just different branding):

1. [Walton Chase](https://waltonchase.com/)
2. [Top Market Cap](https://topmarketcap.com/)

And the [reviews for Walton Chase](https://au.trustpilot.com/review/waltonchase.com) do not look so good. 

Red flags I can identify:

1. The above reviews for Walton Chase (which seems like the same firm)
2. My friend sent me the UK phone number of Walton Chase - his profile picture is just a stock bitcoin image.
3. I cannot find much on the internet if i google for Dave Clarkson, or his phone number or about The Investment Center.
4. They are now calling her almost twice every week asking to invest more money.
5. On some posts on the internet I can see that they claim they have 20 years of experience in the investment sector, but their website was only active since March 2020 (using Way Back Machine).
6. 300% return in 3 months !

&amp;#x200B;

I have discussed this with my friend and she has discussed with her other friends, and they think that as these are very high risk investments, they have very high returns, and also very high chances of losing the investment. So people who lose their investments end up posting bad reviews online. My friend and her friend group are not really convinced this is a scam and want to keep investing.

I am not into the world of investing much myself. I do have a ""safe"" VGS ETF, so my friend obviously think I know nothing about these ""high return"" investments.

2. 25%: **The Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Index** (Commodity Futures, precious metals)
3. 25%: **S&amp;P Global LargeMidCap Commodity and Resources Index** (looks to be invested in material and natural resource companies, e.g. $FMC, $XOM, $RIO, etc.) 
4. 20%: **S&amp;P Global Infrastructure Index** (kind of like #3 but more focused on utilities and energy, $NEE, $ENB, $SO). 
5. 20%: **The Bloomberg Barclays US Government Inflation-Linked 1-10 Year Bond Index** (TIPS) 

This seems like a decent inflation protection fund. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.23%. I'm not sure how expense ratios work, but I would guess that means there's the also the expense ratios behind these 5 funds as well? So the overall expense ratio might actually be a lot more?

I have 70% in US Stock Index (55% SP500, 15% small/mid cap index), 20% in international, and 10% in this ""Real Asset Fund"". 

Do you all think that is wise? I feel adding this fund might help me take advantage of rebalancing and also throw in some value. Do you think 10% is too little or too much?

I rather not keep cash in a retirement account with an employee match. And I don't know how I feel about bonds right now.

$238mil in backlog orders.

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ, August 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)** — AMMO, Inc. (Nasdaq: POWW, POWWP) (“AMMO” or the “Company”), a leading vertically integrated producer of high-performance ammunition and components and operator of GunBroker.com, the largest online marketplace serving the firearms and shooting sports industries today announced results for its first quarter of fiscal 2022 ended June 30, 2021.

**First Quarter Fiscal 2022 versus First Quarter Fiscal 2021:**

●Net revenues increased 360% year-over-year to $44.5 million ●Marketplace revenue was $12.3 million reflecting the acquisition of GunBroker.com ●Gross profit margin was 42.7% compared to 11.1% ●Net income was $9.5 million compared to a net loss of $3.1 million ●Diluted EPS of $0.08 compared to ($0.07); Adjusted EPS of $0.13 compared to ($0.01) ●Adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million versus a loss of $0.3 million ●Backlog of $238 million

“We delivered solid first quarter results, exceeding estimates for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Core ammunition sales were up more than three-fold reflecting strong underlying demand for our unique, high-performance products. We also added over $12 million of high-margin Marketplace revenue with the GunBroker.com acquisition that closed in April,” said Fred Wagenhals, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMMO, Inc. “Integration efforts are advancing on schedule and we are working on several major initiatives to further accelerate growth across our powerful Marketplace platform. Construction of our new manufacturing facility is also on track and we continue to make progress with new product development and government contracts. I am very proud of our team’s commitment and execution in driving significant value for all stakeholders.”

**First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Results**

Net revenues of $44.5 million were up 360% versus last year driven by strong growth in Ammunition and incremental revenue from the acquisition of GunBroker.com. Ammunition sales totaled $28.4 million compared to $6.4 million in last year’s first quarter, an increase of 342%. Marketplace revenue was $12.3 million reflecting the GunBroker.com business we acquired on April 30, 2021.

Gross profit was $19.0 million in the first quarter versus $1.1 million in the year-earlier period due to the increased sales of Ammunition coupled with the addition of our Marketplace segment, which included GunBroker.com. Gross profit margin was 42.7% in the first quarter compared to 11.1% in last year’s first quarter reflecting the impact of our higher margin Marketplace revenue.

Operating expenses were $9.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $3.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase was attributable to operating the GunBroker.com business for approximately two months, higher commission payments stemming from growth in our Ammunition sales, higher stock-based compensation expense, and professional fees related to the acquisition of GunBroker.com. As a percent of sales, operating expenses declined to 20.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 from 40.0% in the year-earlier period reflecting operating leverage, manufacturing scale and the mix shift in favor of higher margin Marketplace revenues.

Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was $9.7 million compared to an operating loss of $2.8 million in last year’s first quarter.

Net income was $9.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to a net loss of $3.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income available to common shareholders was $9.2 million or $0.08 per fully diluted share versus a net loss of $3.1 million and ($0.07) per fully diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted net income per share was $0.13 in versus an adjusted per share loss of ($0.01).

Adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.3 million a year earlier.

**Outlook**

We are increasing our fiscal 2022 revenue guidance from $190 million to $210 million, including reiterating our expectation for second quarter fiscal 2022 revenue of at least $51 million. We estimate third quarter fiscal 2022 revenue will be approximately $60 million. We are increasing our Adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2022 from $65 million to $70 million.",1629159858,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p5st86/poww_blew_away_earnings_again_and_raised_2022_rev/

\+ Received authorization from Swedish regulators to initiate a Phase 2 clinical study of Endoxifen to reduce mammographic breast density (MBD).

\+ Received authorization from Australian regulators to initiate a clinical study of AT-H201 which is being developed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and “long haul” respiratory illness.

\+ Announced final results from its Phase 1 double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study using Atossa’s proprietary drug candidate AT-301 administered by nasal spray. AT-301 was considered safe and well tolerated in healthy male and female participants in this study at two different dose levels over 14 days. AT-301 is being developed for at home use for patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19.

\+ ""The intended mechanism of action of AT-301 is to prevent virus entry into human cells by inhibiting the obligatory Spike Protein activation.

Let’s talk about the timeline on Phase 3 for Endoxifen. FDA 505(b)(2) may bring Endoxifen to market without the need of Phase 3.

As discussed in this video: [https://youtu.be/rmuCfrJ8Se4](https://youtu.be/rmuCfrJ8Se4)

\&gt; \[Interviewer\]can you shed some colour on what maybe a phase 3 study may look like … since the FDA is already familiar with Tamoxifen and it’s outcomes…?

\&gt; \[Dr Quay\] .. first of all it’s very hard to answer that, but I think one of the things we have talked about in the past is that there’s a pathway called 505(b)(2) which allows you to submit applications for metabolites of drugs that are already approved. There are some special aspects of that package … you’re allowed to reference the data with the primary drug, you’re typically allowed to do one instead of two controlled clinical trials, and you typically get 7 years of market exclusivity independent of your patent situation. So it’s a nice model and we’ve publicly said that this is our target. We’ve obviously not had conversations with the FDA about all of the aspects of our programs qualifying for 505(b)(2), but I mean I think that’s how I would answer that question.

\*\*What is 505(b)(2) ?\*\*

The 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) is a streamlined NDA process in which the applicant relies upon one or more investigations conducted by someone other than the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained right of reference. In other words, the 505(b)(2) pathway enables investigators and/or manufacturers to apply for approval without having to repeat all the drug development work done for an innovator drug.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened a probe into Tesla’s Autopilot software, citing the cars’ repeated collisions with parked emergency vehicles.

The NHTSA investigation will cover Tesla Models Y, X, S, and 3 vehicles released from 2014 through 2021. The federal agency says since 2018 it has logged 11 incidents (which include 17 injuries and one fatality) in which Tesla vehicles using the company’s Autopilot features, like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, have crashed into stationary emergency vehicles. The agency says most of these incidents took place after dark, with the software ignoring scene control measures including warning lights, flares, cones, and an illuminated arrow board.

The investigation will “assess the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver’s engagement with the dynamic driving task during Autopilot operation,” according to NHTSA’s notes.

AN NHTSA SPOKESPERSON REMINDED THE PUBLIC THAT NO COMMERCIAL VEHICLES CAN DRIVE THEMSELVES
A spokesperson for the agency said that the investigation was in its preliminary stages and primarily concerned with uncovering additional information about the incidents. The spokesperson noted that the public should be aware that no commercially available cars are able to drive themselves, and vehicles always require a human in control at all times.

The inability of driving-assistance software from Tesla and other automakers to spot parked emergency vehicles is well known. Experts told Wired in 2018 that the likely cause is that these systems are programmed to mostly ignore stationary objects, otherwise they might react to all sorts of items on the side of roads, from signs to buildings.

Wired’s report notes that both Tesla and Volvo’s driving assist manuals warn drivers about this problem. As Tesla’s says: “Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cannot detect all objects and may not brake/decelerate for stationary vehicles, especially in situations when you are driving over 50 mph (80 km/h) and a vehicle you are following moves out of your driving path and a stationary vehicle or object is in front of you instead.”

The NHTSA has stepped up its scrutiny of Tesla in recent months as the company’s Autopilot software has been the focus of an increasing number of crashes. Many industry experts have criticized Tesla for its marketing of the software, which often suggests that human oversight of the vehicle is optional.

In April, senators urged the NHTSA to take “corrective actions” against Tesla and prevent misuse of its driving-assist software, and in June the agency issued new rules requiring companies like Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo to report all incidents involving such systems.",1629125803,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p5hpdp/us_government_opens_probe_into_tesla_autopilot/

11,investing,Revolutionary-Cry-38,Discover Financial Services (DFS),"**Overview:**

Discover Financial Services operates in two distinct segments direct banking and payment services. Most of us are familiar with their credit card services but they also offer debit cards, money market accounts, loans, and etc. They are the 4th largest payment network in the US and own the largest ATM network in the US (Pulse).

**Valuation overview:**

MC = 40B

PE &lt; 9

PEG &lt; 1

current ratio &gt; 1

cash/debt = 0.8

EV/EBITDA &lt; 6

Looking at their competitors in the payment services the valuation metrics are attractive, and the market cap is significantly lower.

**DCF:**

conservative: Using the 8yr FCF average, 8% FCF growth over the next 5 years, and 4% terminal growth, I get a 16% IRR.

hopeful: Using the 3yr FCF average, 9% FCF growth over the next 5 years, and 5% terminal growth, I get a 19% IRR.

If you look at the FCF over the past 8yrs, it has been consistently growing.

Seems like a good value play. I'm curious on what I'm missing.

The stock has been on a run in the past year which does concern me, but, looking at the current valuation and growth it still look like a good investment.",1629076747,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p561q8/discover_financial_services_dfs/
14,investing,Sheepherder_Nearby,how to determine if bonds are worth it,"Im sure there's some sort of equation that relates volatility of your investments to the amount you draw down per annum to interest rate per annum. People that use the 4% rule typically have 40% bonds because that was what worked best for capital preservation in all cases in tested scenarios. How though, can we determine the optimal percentage bonds should make of our portfolio when we dont follow the 4% rule, because we have a higher return on investment or less volatility achieving the same interest rate that a mostly-stock portfolio would yield over time?",1629073460,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p556uh/how_to_determine_if_bonds_are_worth_it/

34,investing,futureisathreat,My 10-week report of auto investing platforms (mostly robo),"TLDR: Invested in a range of automatic investing platforms (mostly robo-advisors). Made everything aggressive (100% stocks if possible). Every 10-12 weeks I'm switching out the worst performing for something new.

First 10 week results:

1. Titan: **+7.03%**
2. SoFi: **+4.19%**
3. M1 ""Social Responsibility"" Pie: **+4.07%**
4. M1 ""Ultra Aggressive"" Pie: **+3.01%**
5. Wealthfront: **+1.5%**
6. Betterment: **+1.31%**
7. SigFig: **-.34%**

In that same time period, popular ETFs performed pretty well:

* VTI had a **4.25%** increase (Total stock market)
* VOO had a **4.41%** increase (S&amp;P 500)
* QQQ had a **9.65%** increase (Nasdaq 100)

I'm hoping the next cycle will produce better results vs the ETFs.

The purpose of this post is to share my experiences with the different platforms and to help myself find the best platform for me (if any).

This performance is from 5/22 to 7/31

I'm really only following a few rules so I could keep my tracking accurate:

* No deposits during the cycle
* No withdrawals during the cycle
* No manual rebalancing
* After the cycle, swap out at least the worst-performing platform.

1 . Titan: **+7.03%**

1. Actively managed stock portfolio
2. Invests in about 20(?) hand-picked stocks
3. Fees
   1. $5 per month under 10k
   2. 1% over 10k
   3. Can be reduced...
4. 4 Investment Options
   1. Flagship (Large)
   2. Opportunities (Small / Under the radar)
      1. Locked behind 2 referrals
   3. Offshore (International)
      1. Locked behind 2 referrals
   4. Crypto (new)
5. The app is minimal and simple, like their investment choices.

* I think Titan is the newest of all the list of platforms here and it has performed above expectations. There aren't many options, but I kinda like that, but only because they've been performing well.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Trying out the crypto management

2 . SoFi Automated Investing: **+4.19%**

1. Robo Advisor
2. 5 Simple Investment Options ranging from Conservative (100% bonds) to Aggressive (100% Stocks)
3. No Fees
4. Part of what they invest in is their own ETFs, but I believe they waive the fees? Don't quote me on that.
5. The app is awesome.
   1. It's amazing to see all your financial stuff in one place.

* I've been very happy with the SoFi platform as a whole. The automated investing has performed a bit better than expected and it's easy to use.
* In the last 10 weeks, I've started using SoFi for almost everything.
   * Money - Switched to use as my main bank (no stupid fees like other banks... looking at you BofA)
   * Credit Card - 2% back on everything
   * Invest - Opened 3 investment accounts
      * Active - You pick the stocks (Kinda like Robinhood)
      * Automated - Robo-advisor
      * Crypto
   * Relay Connections
      * Budgeting / Tracking sorta like Mint
      * You can connect different accounts and track your spending (Including other investment accounts)
   * Credit Score monitoring - Every week it updates

3/4 . M1 - Social Responsibility and Ultra Aggressive Pies: SR: **+4.07%,** UA: **+3.01%**

1. Active investing
2. You get to create things called ""Pies"" which allows you to allocate percentages for each ""Slice"" of the pie and you can easily rebalance to match your initial allocations.
   1. Slices can be other Pies, ETFs, or Stocks (afaik)
3. There are pre-built pies called ""Expert Pies"" which is what I'm using
   1. They range from General Investing to Hedge Fund mimicking to Dividends
4. No Fees
5. The app is easy enough to understand and is getting better.
   1. Managing multiple pies seemed a little bit of a hassle the first time I tried to do it.
   2. Also, understanding pie creation could use a class or video. You can have Pies within Pies within Pies.

* Pretty interesting concept compared to the others. Seems possible to match the stocks and allocations of what other advisors are doing and you get that all for no fees.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Rebalancing my Pie
   * Adding an ARK Expert Pie slice... yolo?

5 . Wealthfront: **+1.5%**

1. Robo advisor
2. Tax Loss Harvesting
   1. If your investment dips, it sells some of your ETFs and buys similar ones to show a loss on your taxes.
   2. Seems good for high earners, but not as useful for lower tax bracket incomes.
3. .25% Advisor fee over a certain amount... can be increased
4. The app is simple and allocations are easy to change.

* The main benefit of Wealthfront is the TLH.
* It allows you to modify the allocations in which you're investing and what percentage goes into each.
   * These can be stocks, bonds, socially responsible, commodities, and a good bit more... Even crypto (which are invested in investment trusts rather than straight crypto)
* TBH, kinda seems like just an M1 Pie with more limited options.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Changing about 50% of the default allocations, putting some into crypto (limits you to 10%), and some other sectors I'm interested in.

6 . Betterment: **+1.31%**

1. Robo advisor
2. 5 ""investment"" strategies. The main ones are Core (their go-to) and SRI (Socially Responsible)
3. .25% Advisor fee over a certain amount. Resets every year... can be increased
4. The app is simple but figuring out how to just change my investment strategy took like 5 minutes of searching. They should make that easier.

* It does okay. Simple platform, simple choices. I can't change the specific allocations, but it also seems like I could recreate this in M1.
   * I recently switched to the SRI and there's a total of 5 ETFs it's holding.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Switched to SRI instead of the Core to see if it performs any better and if it's worth keeping around.
   * If it continues to perform near the bottom, I'm closing it out.

7 . SigFig: **-.34%**

1. Robo advisor
2. You take a questionnaire to determine your risk level which determines your percentage of Stocks vs Bonds
3. Opens your account through TD Ameritrade
4. .25% advisor fee over $10k
5. Has Tax Loss Harvesting but it never happened for me
6. The app is simple but not very good
   1. My favorite screen is where it shows just how much it's underperforming compared to the S&amp;P 500. smh

* First off, I chose this because it's one of the oldest robo-advisors out there and has a generally good track record.
* Second... it took **3 WEEKS** for my deposit to go through so it can start investing. Every other platform took about **3** ***days***.
* Third, **-.34%???**
* So, it should be obvious by now that this one is getting dropped. Didn't have a good experience with it at all. And I expected very little to begin with.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Withdrawing my money and closing my account... Hopefully doesn't take another 3 weeks to withdraw.
   * Trying out another investment platform. Decided on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. A little concerned with the amount they keep in cash reserves. We'll see how it performs.

What's your experience with investment platforms?

What are your favorites?

I'll try to be back again in a few months with another update.

39,investing,zerowangtwo,Questions about calculating the volatility of a stock,"I know there are many different ways to calculate volatility, dependent on how you're measuring it. One of the ways on [this site](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-calculate-stock-volatility/), however, seems to be a bit lacking. They calculate the interday changes as percentages and then take the standard deviation of these returns, but this means that a stock which goes up 10% every day will be less volatile than a stock that goes up 1% and down 1% every two days? I suppose in a sense you could send the second stock is more volatile, but in terms of price movements the first stock moves a lot more...

I’m not employed currently because I’m going to be attending college full time on August 28th.

I don’t need money in the next couple of months as my only monthly expenses are an $11 gym membership and a $60 phone bill along with $110 budgeted for food.
I need to know it is 100% safe.
I don’t own any assets in stocks or options and don’t know how these things work.
I have no debt.
I’m in college for computer science and plan to get into software engineering.
I know how to make websites and make customized clothing and make music videos, but I make little to no money with any of these skills($85 a month or less) despite these skills taking me months to learn.
I turn 20 in less than two months.
I don’t have family members who can teach me much in investing. My dad and stepdad ask me for money and don’t pay me back and my mom can barely handle rent.
I have no kids and don’t plan on making any for many years.
No felonies.
I am easily distracted and a slow learner.
All I know about stocks is to put your money in the company and if the company does well, the line goes up, you sell the stock, and you make money.

From the point of view of a company, a low market cap means that a hostile takeover becomes a risk for management but beside that, what else would that mean?

For instance, companies that pay decent dividends &gt;2.5% are older more mature slower growing companies. Why would someone take buy shares in an old business whose stock price will barely move just because they get 3 4 or 5% return?

In another situation, you could invest in growth stock-- which are more volatile, however we can take advantage of their dip to buy more shares-- and get more capital appreciation.

In example one lets say you buy an old company like $KO which has gone up 18% in the last year + 3% dividend lets say you get a 21% return this year (of course and exceptional year for the market and will likely not continue giving 21% due to lack of growth.

If you bought $QQQ, you would have a much higher return 34.5% in the past year (especially over the past five years blows any dividend etf out the water) but you would have missed that because it only offers .5% dividend.

It is not hard to imagine that growth stocks will continue to outperform value because of their technological innovative advantage. So are dividends just for pure psychological motivation to keep the investor investing? Because he can yield that and then some in capital appreciation. As stated qqq up 34% this year, thats like getting a 34% dividend yield! I can sell as much as I want and spend it anything-- just like a dividend, so whats with all the bruhaha regarding divies?",1629019366,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p4qba5/are_dividends_just_for_psychological_comfort/

We are giving it away for free. 

It's a web app, Android and iOS coming soon. 

We, at weInvest, predict we will soon be paid to trade. here's an explanation behind our thesis 

in 1999, around 20% of household owned stocks. that was 15% in 1995. this number inflated due to cheap trading and UIs from the likes of etrade and others. 

prior to 1975 commission for stock trading was expensive. full-service firms competed for your business. by the mid 90s discount brokers, following deregulation, were offering trades for 40-60 dollars. this was half of what it cost before deregulation. 

in the late 90s, etrade took off with the discount brokerage model, and charged roughly $20 per trade. by 2001 they brought their commission down to $13. at that time 2/3 of their revenue came from trading commissions and the rest came from interest on cash balances. comissions continued to fall. by 2017 the average fee per trade was less than $10. a couple years later, trading was free. couple more years later, robinhood would ipo for over 30b. etrade on the other hand, was acquired by MS for  13b. etoro with a 10b spac. 

With the broker/dealers worth tens of billions, and daily revenue amounting to many millions; the free markets, the sharing economy, and the creator economy, will drive these prices down below zero. you will be paid to trade. the future is a decentralized organization, owned by the community. a DAO that allows token holders to vote on governance. 

this is the vision for weinvest. we have built a functional protocol and APIs. we have established go-to-market partnerships to begin facillitating trading cryptocurrencies for low fees, less than what you pay at coinbase. trade stocks commission free. 

stay tuned, for more to come.

Now, basic math tells us that if either Short/Current Long Term Debt or Long Term Debt are above 0, the net borrowings will be a negative number, assuming the Cash &amp; Equivalents &amp; Short Term Investments are above 0 aswell. 

My current example is MSFT. They have \~130B Cash on hand and \~82B in Debt. If they were to clear their debt right now they would have quite a bit of cash left. With this in mind, how can Net Borrowings be \~-48B?

35,investing,thecrazednutter,Is it fair to say that the Great Recession + low rates/QE helped jump start the smartphone revolution?,"The Great Recession made tech companies and software companies much more valuable. These firms had much lower marginal costs and were poised to reap large profits. 

Low rates meant these firms could use debt to expand their servers, cloud capacity and R&amp;D spending. What was once considered to be science fiction became common place within a few short years. 

Furthermore, QE meant that investors were less willing to park money in bonds, since the yields were paltry. QE increased stock market valuations, which in turn lead to firm expansion.

If the Great Recession was shorter and less severe is it fair to say that the tech boom of the 2010s would be far more modest?",1628972052,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p4f8cr/is_it_fair_to_say_that_the_great_recession_low/
36,investing,xXguitarsenXx,Asset allocation strategies: Best way of achieving 60/40 equity/bond ratio by age 60?," What is the best way of achieving your desired asset allocation by the age of your retirement?

In this example I’m going to ASSUME you want 60% equity and 40% bonds by the age of 60. The basic strategy I recommend could be used for any other asset ratio that has to be achieved by some age.

# Best way of achieving 60/40 equity/bond ratio at 60 year old?

### OPTION 1: Buying/selling to rebalance towards “age minus 20 in bonds” ratio

This strategy involves selling/buying yearly to rebalance to “*Age minus 20 in bonds.*”, and for the upcoming year buy equity/bonds in that ratio.

**Age minus 20 in bonds:**

* 20-year-olds should have 0% bonds
* 30-year-olds should have 10% bonds
* 40-year-olds should have 20% bonds
* 60-year olds should have 40%.bonds

So you end up with 60% equity and 40% bonds at 60-year-old.

### OPTION 2: Only buy 100% equity and later only buy 100% bonds

With this strategy you start by ONLY buying 100% equity, and then based on your expected earnings and the expected return for equity/bonds, you pick an age where you start buying 100% bonds, in the hopes of achieving a 60/40 equity/bond ratio at age 60!

I know that it’s a lot harder to hit a 60/40 equity/bond ratio at age 60 using this strategy, but isn’t it superior in terms of return if you manage to do it? (because equity has higher expected returns and you hold it for a longer time with this strategy)

Also, this strategy has lower transaction fee’s, because you don’t ever sell to rebalance.

# My questions:

* Which of these 2 options for asset allocation to achieve a 60/40 equity/bond allocation by age 60 do you find optimal?
* Do you think some other strategy is better?
* What should I search for when researching this problem? Can you recommend any good papers talking about this?",1628971539,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p4f309/asset_allocation_strategies_best_way_of_achieving/

Could it be that it is just the way our brains are wired? Even more interestingly - could we profit by going against the way our brains are wired?

The Monty Hall problem is the one with the three doors. One has a flash car behind it and the other two a goat. Pick the door with the flash car and you win it. After selecting the door the host opens one of the two other doors with a goat behind and asks you if you want to change. Most people select the wrong answer. Almost everyone, including highly intelligent people, have great difficulty understanding why they chose not to switch doors, even though it would have given them a higher chance of winning. Even after the mistake is explained, it is far from being intuitive. There are numerous YouTube videos about this.

The problem  is interesting in itself, but even more so, the fact that some problem solutions are simply counter-intuitive.

Could it be that stock picking is one of these? I cannot present any evidence one way or the other, but what if it is?

""In Most Markets, Lower Risk Means Higher Reward"" by dawangy on LessWrong 

&gt;In my view, the most comprehensive empirical study of a similar result was in Frazzini and Pedersen. In this paper the authors examined the low beta phenomenon by constructing hypothetical portfolios that are long low beta stocks and short high beta stocks in market-neutral ratios. Using this approach, the authors determined that low beta was associated with excess returns in 19 out of 20 countries' stocks, and was also true in many alternative markets such as those for corporate bonds, treasuries, foreign exchange, and commodities. The in-sample effect was strongest in the Canadian stock market, and the Austrian stock market was the only studied market for which the effect was (very slightly) negative. The out of sample construction based on the methodology created in sample was also positive in all nations studied except Sweden. Note that this is slightly different from my headline, as it suggests that the ""risk-adjusted"" returns of low beta stocks is higher than those of high beta stocks. Not necessarily that the returns of low beta stocks are higher in general.

&gt;The hypothesis of Frazzini and Pedersen is that some investors are leverage constrained, meaning that they are less capable of borrowing funds in order to increase exposure to equity. This leads those less capable of leverage to seek the higher expected returns dictated by their preferences through exposure to riskier stocks, which reduces the risk adjusted expected returns of riskier stocks because investors will purchase them at discounted expected returns to achieve artificial market leverage.",1628891507,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p3v1md/in_most_markets_lower_risk_means_higher_reward_in/

I am currently using a BrokerageLink with my 403b and unfortunately, they don't allow the purchase of ETFs, only mutual funds. I'm trying to small-cap value tilt with FISVX (Russel 2000 value index, 0.05% ER), but there is an Avantis AVUVX (Also Russel 2000 but with profitability/other factors, 0.25%ER). The latter also charges a $50 transaction fee. Assuming I transfer 20,000 into the AVUVX fund, it would effectively be an additional 0.25% ER (50/20000 = 0.25%ER) for a total of 0.5%. Obviously, this ""effective"" ER increases with more transfers, and would only make sense for large one-time transfers.

I was just wondering if you guys thought the increased price would justify transferring over, perhaps 1x/yr when a large lump sum can be done to counteract the $50 fee. Thankfully these are all tax-protected and there are no $5M minimums through BrokerageLink.

I am wondering if anyone else is following these methods and would care to share experiences/lessons. 

Here's what I think at this point: 

William O'Neil's book (How to Make Money in Stocks) was very valuable and worth the time to the read it. The parts on the use of fundamental analysis to identify high growth stocks is very useful even though similar material can be found elsewhere (Peter Lynch). What I found truly insightful were the parts on the stock price behaviour near the top of the stock's rally (breaking support, climax tops, weak action) and the inclusion of 100 graphs of successful companies from the past. I spent quite some time analyzing those. What I also found nice is that he covers all components of the investment strategy (what to buy, when to buy, how much to buy, when to enter, when to exit) and not just parts of it. The chapter on market trend identification was also very useful especially the discussion of bottoming out and how to get in again. I really liked the book.  

I ended up thinking CANSLIM may be a good method to run a part of my portfolio focused on hypergrowth companies. The methods requires a fair amount of work (especially in the early part as you are learning it, I guess). The MarketSmith tool was very good, I found myself using it a lot. I was not quite convinced by his arguments to enter after price consolidation only (on breakouts from patterns). I understand the rationale (avoid getting stopped out on natural volatility pullbacks) but you can achieve it by other means - like entering in partial amounts and building the position up by pyramiding up without sitting and watching your stock to up 100% and waiting for the eventual 20% pullback and recovery. But I do follow it, just to be consistent, at least until I get better at the method. 

Minervini's books were equally useful and worth the time to go through them. I especially liked the Stage 2 concept (don't enter overexteded stocks) and the concept of risk budget. Again, between his first and second book, he discusses the complete strategy and not just bit and pieces of it. Good books as well. 

I found some parts of the books omitting important information: for instance, the 100 model stock charts only show the part where the stock runs up and not the part where it crashes afterwards. Or the fact that the model charts mention the stock went up 400%+ but do not mention that using this method, you would capture two times 20% of it, at best. But I guess they have a product to sell so you need to use your own judgement to analyze the information. 

Once I was through the three books, I started trading the method (in May). I am at a point where I am looking for people familiar with the method to discuss.

I was thinking about it today. In today's money your kids and grandkids can benefit from the majority of your assets, but if legal, you could also benefit future generations with smaller amounts of money with longer compounding time-frame. 

For example say you left 500k to your kids total but also split $1k for future generations and specified the money is to be held in say a total market fund for the duration until disbursement.

If you did that for the following 5 generations (assuming a generation is roughly 30 years) by the time the 5th generation received their initial $1,000 dollar investment, 1800 months would have passed.

I have been thinking about investment opportunities which will be massive in the future (10+ years). So companies in their baby shoes, being cheap too, which will boom massively. I have identified following themes:


Psychedelics - It becomes more and more obvious that depression, PTSD etc. can be treated with such. I believe it will play massive part in future health care

Cannabis - Once the US makes it legal on federal level the market will explode

Lab Meat - For environmental, ethical and efficiency reasons future meat will be produced in a lab

space travel - if you can spend a reasonable amount of time in space for a reasonable price, you will do so. Even if it’s a stretch.

Low Maintenance Costs to Boost Market Growth

The low maintenance costs of electric scooters is expected to push the revenue of the electric scooter and battery market. Rising prices of fuel and aversion towards fuel-driven vehicles due to rise of climate consciousness can bode well for the market. Adoption of scooters by ride sharing and bike taxi services will attract more sales.

Government Support to Favor Market

The electric scooter and battery market is expected to augment its value owing to existing electrification of bus and car fleets. Government initiatives in curtailing emission levels and sustainable goals of countries to go electric by 2030 can favor the market considerably. Focus of manufacturers on creating sustainable designs and sales of e-motorcycles can encourage investments in the market. Utilization of lithium-ion batteries and efforts to increase its charging capacity by finding suitable materials for holding it can also facilitate market growth.

Shortage of Charging Infrastructure

The shortage of investments of charging infrastructure can create hurdles for the electric and scooter battery market. Dependence on fuel stations and lack of charging stations can pose a challenge. But conversion of existing stations and investments in available lands can propel market growth.

**COVID-19 Impact**

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the sales of electric scooter and battery market. Shutdown of showrooms and production units can negatively impact market growth. The market is vulnerable due to being dependent on foreign sources for its battery technology. However, sustainable goals of nations and development of long-lasting swappable battery packs can bode well for the market over the forecast period.

**Segmentation**

Battery-based Segment to Capture Maximum Share

On the basis of type, the battery-based electric scooter segment held the largest market share owing to increasing sales of electric scooters. It is expected to maintain its position in the global market during the forecast period due to need for affordable mopeds by low-middle class customers.

Self-balancing Electric Scooters to Dominate Market

Self-balancing scooters are expected to dominate the global electric scooter and battery market.

APAC to Lead Global Electric Scooter and Battery Market

APAC had captured a market share of 52.1% in 2018. It can lead in the global electric scooter and battery market owing to government initiatives encouraging electric mobility and tax credits offered to first-time owners.

DUBAI, UAE, Aug. 13, 2021 /PR Newswire/ -- LandOrc, headquartered in UAE, is a new Tech solutions provider that facilitates lending for real estate industry by providing access to Decentralised Financing (DeFI) and utilising land titles in non-fungible token (NFT) form as a collateral, with all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain for greater trust, transparency and speed.

The value of the world's real estate market reached US$280.6 trillion, the highest figure ever recorded by Savills'. With an annual increase of 6.2%, residential real estate accounted for the largest share (US$ 220.6 trillion) of the market. Commercial real estate (US$ 33.3 trillion) and agricultural and forestry real estate (US$ 27.1 trillion) made up the rest.

In 2017, the average global base lending rate was 11.53%, but it has since increased almost across the board in 2019 (11.57%). According to a 2020 KPMG report.

**Digitalizing the real-estate market with NFTs + DeFI**

Digitalization in the real estate market has been emerging. However, processes are often a time and labour-consuming affair and have often been seen as a stagnant investment for large corporations, especially those with assets in different countries.

""Property Developers need loans for development and this funding gap needed to be closed. In came the private lending sector to support, but alas, the Covid-19 pandemic led to a decline in both capacity and appetite to lend as companies shifted their focus on their existing businesses and bottom lines.""

""Furthermore, there is a dearth of transparency in processes causing volatility in property prices and coupled with slow transactions, the real estate market is in desperate need of a digital transformation. Complicating these are the snail-paced speed with which transactions occur,"" said Damo, Chief Executive Officer of LandOrc.io.

The NFTs are built on blockchain, a distributed ledger technology currently being widely adopted for various applications. NFTs are essentially digital tokens that carry data and are stored in the immutable blockchain ledger.

NFTs optimize real estate processes by implementing it in infrastructural, architectural, or physical assets such as buildings and title or ownership deeds. 

As NFTs can be digitally represented, tracing and tracking ownership and authenticity of the digitally represented asset is simplified to a fraction of the time taken in traditional processes.

Land NFT (LNFT) represents the land title on the blockchain allowing for tracking changes in ownership as it moves from the wallet, including placing it as collateral for lending.

Associated information like valuation, site location, and visuals, as well as vicinity analysis are brought on-chain via oracles and stored in the associated IPFS (InterPlanetary File System, a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol) for easy and secured access.

This allows for hybridized digital-physical land titles that makes authentication and tracking and tracing of ownership of properties a breeze.

**LandOrc's NFT + DEFI ecosystem features**  


* simplified complex real estate transaction processes
* shortened traditional real estate transaction processes from 4 months to 21 days
* ease of managing collateral due to traceability of ownership
* real estate lending options that are lower than locally accessible rates

""The time has come for property players to look into NFTs as a realistic and practical solution to circumvent the pain points that have been plaguing the industry for decades,"" said Damodharan Vijayaragavan, Chief Executive Officer of LandOrc.io.

Decentralised Financing (DeFi), the process of using blockchain based financing, has grown to USD 87 billion in May 2021 based on Defi Pulse Data. Thus, providing a new source for bridging the real estate funding gap.

LandOrc enables DeFi participants to utilise LandOrc Tokens (LORC) as alternative financing for staking on property development projects. Members of the LandOrc ecosystem are involved in key decisions of the platform including the choice of projects for lending. The Land Governance Token (LGOV) can then be utilised to vote for the choices made in a transparent manner on the blockchain.

*Miami, August 15th 2021* – Squeareat’s fundraising on the Wefunder platform already reached the minimum target (100,000 dollars) and new investors continue every day to believe in the project by bringing the company closer to the final goal of  700.000 dollars. 

Squareat is an innovative startup created to revolutionize the “ready to eat” food industry

How?

The answer is modular squared food.

Squareat unique production chain allows to transform raw foods in standardized 50-gram squares that are healthy, natural long lasting, tasty and easy to store and deliver.

""We have experienced first-hand the inefficiencies of the traditional meal plan services and have seen a clear possibility of disruption in bringing a complete transformation to a sector that is growing tremendously fast, introducing a brand new concept. Thanks to the Squared shape we are able to run a mass production while using gourmet techniques. Thermal shocking conservation, low temperature cooking and vacuum sealing packing allow us to produce a superior quality food and sell it at an affordable price.

Paolo Cadegiani, Founder and CEO of the company, explains.”

Squareat team is a combination of young and passionate entrepreneurs, high rated chefs, web developers and designers with more than 10 years of experience in the industry.

For the first phase the business is focused on a meal plan delivery service but their goal is to expand the distribution throught  many different channels taking advantages of the versatile product’s nature and its unlimited applications.

More investments will certainly accelerate this process bringing the company quickly to the next level. 

The campaign launched on Wefunder, the largest crowdfunding portal in the United States, aims to raise the funds allocating the investments both on  developing  a complete automatized production chain and the marketing campaign . This will result in a big improvement of the production while cutting costs significantly.

""We are happy to welcome Squeareat on our platform, United States is a country full of opportunities with people open to a change.

We can only wish them a successful campaign” said Nicholas Tommarello, CEO of wefunder.",1628791940,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p35h1d/squareat_is_ready_to_revolutionize_the_food/

Here is a couple of stocks that might be worth your attention this week. This is part 2 of 2.

This is not a sponsored content. I'm just sharing my thoughts with you, hoping you're going to enjoy it.

This  short list was compiled with help of various sources of data, including  Buy recommendations from several renowned stock data providers and  analytical services. This is why I’m calling the approach a **consensus strategy.**  The stocks I’m going to present you below are generally believed to  outperform the stock market in the coming months, they have a consensus  recommendation of Buy, their fundamentals are scored considerably better  than most stocks and their average target price by stock analysts is  above current market valuation.

In order to consider buying the stock’s shares, the following criteria need to be satisfied:

* **TheStreet score**: A+, A or A-
* **Zacks Rank**: 1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3      (Hold)
* **Weiss Ratings recommendation**: A or B
* **Yahoo Finance recommendation**: at least mixed Buy/Hold
* **MarketBeat recommendation**: at least mixed Buy/Hold
* **Yahoo Finance target price**: min. 5% higher than current      price
* **MarketBeat target price**: min. 5% higher than current      price
* **Piotroski F-Score**: min. 4
* **Moody’s Daily Credit Risk**: 1 to 6
* **InvestorsObserver Overall Score**: min. 50

**Note**: Descriptions of those criteria are provided at the end of this post.

If  you decide to buy any of the below stocks, you might want to consider  the following selling conditions (at least one of them should be  satisfied):

* price is higher or close to      target
* profit is in range 20% – 30%
* loss is higher than 50%
* TheStreet recommendation is      changed to Sell
* Weiss Ratings recommendation is      changed to Sell
* Yahoo Finance recommendation is      changed to Sell

**Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.**

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *–  The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance  while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of  total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most  of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns  compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication —  not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to  deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology:

*TheStreet  Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a  12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends***\*.  Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to  perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest  rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both\* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements.  For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market  returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted  company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past  operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It  is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re  avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks  Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s  shares.

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The  company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong  performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price  that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion  is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior  performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best  stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be  considered the equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The  company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of  performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock  is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value,  with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good  investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered  the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price**

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the MarketBeat stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the  predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5%  higher than the current valuation.

**6. Piotroski F-Score**

The  Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria  used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation,  including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the  worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in Piotroski's paper from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus website.

**7. Moody’s Daily Credit Risk**

Moody’s  Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a  forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily  and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a  company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from Business Insider's website and is expected to be in the range of 1-6.

**8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50. From their website:

*The  Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long  Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall  score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your  investing style.*

*A  low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just  that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview website (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

52,investing,15pH,Easy 7.4% returns by loaning out stablecoins ... thoughts? How to assess risk?,"The reputable crypto exchange Gemini has a program (Gemini Earn: [https://www.gemini.com/earn](https://www.gemini.com/earn) ) wherein users can loan out their crypto assets and earn interest for participating. Best I can understand, Gemini loans your assets through (to) a company called Genesis ([https://genesistrading.com/lending/](https://genesistrading.com/lending/)), who loans the crypto to exchanges who need it for liquidity or market making....or something.

On upside, this is a way to make an extra \~3%/yr on bitcoin or ethereum. Interestingly, they offer 7.4%/yr for participating with a few stablecoins, meaning the value of the coins does not change and you make a ""guaranteed"" 7.4%/yr.

The fine print states the the loan is not secured; borrowers post no collateral. So, if I participate, I understand that the coins I loan out may never be returned. This brings several questions to mind and I'd love to hear some thoughts:

1) Is there any way to assess the level of risk here? How can we possibly determine if this is a good investment? With bonds, there is some calculable measure of risk via credit ratings, but this program seems 100% opaque beyond vague promises that borrowers are heavily vetted.

2) Given that these loans are all aggregated and packaged on the Gemini side, to the point where we can withdraw our ""loaned"" assets at any time, How would Gemini distribute the losses if a borrower defaults on repayment?

3) Other thoughts?",1628744669,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p2t45w/easy_74_returns_by_loaning_out_stablecoins/

Management reported revenues hurt by low tomato prices and bad growing results, plus they’re changing the company structure of the SPAC thats less than a year old. Seems like they should have known the ideal structure from the get-go. In 5 years they’re talking about ebita around 115 to 130 million, and are currently valued at ~850 million with ~295 million in cash that should be spent up quickly as they grow. 

That all being said, I’m always interested in taking a look at a stock when it falls this quickly because companies don’t change value that fast overnight (normally).

I would like to find out what mental tricks you use to get around the loss aversion bias.

I have been listening to a talk by Daniel Kahneman.

He refers to the loss aversion bias. We feel the pain of loss more than the pleasure of gains. He refers to a psychological experiment of tossing a coin. If it landed heads, you would lose 1k. How much would you have to win to make it worth while. It seems that the answer is approx 2-to-1.

He advises that we should take a broader portfolio view.

I was wondering what mental tricks you use. Because I am sure that it must affect me - even if I'm not aware of it.

This post is not mine, I'm re-sharing from [r/FluentInFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/) because I see a lot of P&amp;D's on reddit, and don't want anyone to lost money!

&amp;#x200B;

**Original post:**

A lot of investors having been asking questions on what to look at when considering a stock, and where to find the information, so I put this guide together on the things I look at. I'm just a regular guy who's been investing for about 19 years, with a degree in finance/ accounting, and working in the finance field. I hope this helps.

There points below are basically the things I cover when I look at a stock, and where I get them from. (This list is in no particular order. Below is just my preference. Everyone's due diligence process is different. Find what works for you!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Know the company.** I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible. What do they do? How do they make money? Why are they important? What are their products?

1. Positives? Strengths? Moat? Advantages? Opportunities? Growth? Catalysts?
2. Downside? Negatives? Concerns? Weaknesses? Threats? Risks?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Growth**. I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news, 10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future growth. I find out out new products, or a changing landscape. How will the company scale?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Financial health**. Are the financials strong? Is the company financially healthy? Are cash flows from operations positive? How are Investing &amp; Financing Cashflows? Is net income growing? Are profit margins Getting better? Is the Quick ratio over 2 to sustain operations? Is EPS growing? Income Statement Trend, etc.

1. *ChartMill.com*: [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/fundamental-analysis](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/fundamental-analysis)  


* **Earnings &amp; revenue history.** Is there growth? Is there potential? I look at the financials and the projections. Have they missed earnings? Have they beat earnings? Has earnings remained flat or grew consistently?

2. *GuruFocus*: [https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL/dcf](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL/dcf)  


* **Price upside/ targets &amp; Analysts rating consensus**. I am curious about what the analysts covering a stock think it's worth. I look to see what the analysts covering it, have to say about the price targets.

2. *ChartMill*: [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/analyst-ratings](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/analyst-ratings)  


* **Charts Analysis and the technical indicators**. I am curious about what the charts have to say about momentum, and what prior prices and charting have to say about price prediction. I try to read and interpret the charts to see what previous trading patterns can predict. What are the short-term, mid-term and long-term predictions? I look at RSI, moving averages, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, etc.

* **CEO, Management Team and Leadership:** I check Glassdoor and Indeed to learn about the management of the company, and google their CEO. A CEO with low/ bad ratings is a bad sign

&amp;#x200B;

* **Short selling.** How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it? If so, why are they?

&amp;#x200B;

* **What is the put/call ratio?** Are people betting against this stock? Then is so, research why. This might be reasons to be weary.

1. *ChartMill.com:* [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/ownership](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/ownership)  


* How many **ETFs** that hold this stock? Will they continue to buy it up and drive price?

1. ETFDB: [https://etfdb.com/stock/AAPL/](https://etfdb.com/stock/AAPL/)  


* **Recent News**. I Google the company and look at recent articles. What are people saying? What are bloggers saying? What is the news saying? Any new news? Bad news? Good News? Reasons for movement in recent stock price?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Social sentiment**. I check what people are saying on twitter and google search trends.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Average volume** traded. Is this stock liquid? Would I be able to get my money back? How easy can I trade it. How large/small are the bid/ask spreads?

One of Benjamin Graham’s investment criteria instructs conservative investors to avoid trading stocks trading above 1.5x their book value. If one would have followed this advice, in the last decade they would hold nothing but a few insurance and bank stocks.

Just before Graham died in 1976 he was asked if detailed fundamental analysis of stocks (a technique he became famous for) was still a favorable investment strategy, his exact words were -

73,investing,hedonova,Investing in art as a retail investor,"***Disclosure:*** *Hedonova invests in works of art. Hedonova conducts business with some of the firms mentioned here. This is not investment advice.*

&amp;#x200B;

We've all read about paintings being bought and sold for tens of millions of dollars and wondered how could something that a 5-year-old could make be worth so much! We've gawked at the magnitude of money changing hands in the highbrow world of fine art and wanted to be part of the game. 

Just like startups, where only a fraction goes on to become unicorns, a minuscule percentage of artists command million-dollar price tags. They're the Picassos, Basquaits, Warhols, and Monets of the world.

Art prices, like startup valuation, can seem mystical. They're driven by popular trends, condition, rarity, popularity in pop culture, quantitative factors like auction history and provenance (who's owned it before you). Here's a look at how art markets work and how retail investors can profit from it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights**

* Art is a $1.7 trillion market.
* Institutional exposure to art is just 1% of their portfolio, compared to 38% in listed equities (large opportunity for growth).
* Contemporary art (art post-1960s) has returned 13.64% compared to 8.9% for the S&amp;P 500 in the last 25 years. [(view chart)](https://files.pixpa.com/117214/1628437279987-5986.png)
* Online purchase of high-end artwork is up 500% since 2020 because of covid.
* We notice that the works by the best-selling artists provide higher returns than emerging artists. Top artists are represented by the Artprice100 index. [(Chart - Artprice100 vs S&amp;P500)](https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/2018/02/artp100-2018-1-750x456.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**Art vs other assets classes - Financial performance**

|Asset class|25-year CAGR|Correlation to contemporary art Maximum annualized loss observed (3-year horizon)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Art|13.6%|\-0.5%|
|S&amp;P500|8.9%|\-7.2%|
|Global equities|7.6%|\-14.5%|
|Gold|6.5%|\-16.4$|
|US Housing|4.1%|\-13.8%|

^(\*For the period between 1985 and 2020)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros of art investing**

1. **Art is uncorrelated to equity markets.** The correlation factor stands at 0.34.
2. **Art is resilient in market downturns.** Buyers of artwork tend to be ultra HNIs who normally have disposable incomes even during market downturns. During the 2008 crisis where equity markets dropped around 50%, art markets dropped around 20%.
3. **Art performs well in high inflation regimes.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Average real return during periods when US inflation was higher than 3%.**

|Asset class|Real returns|
|:-|:-|
|Contemporary art|23%|
|Emerging market equities|12.6%|
|REITs|5%|
|S&amp;P 500|3.8%|
|Gold|0.2%|

^(\*For the period between 1985 and 2020)

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons of art investing**

1. Quantitative data &amp; research are scarce and not available publicly.
2. ~~Illiquid~~. Art used to be illiquid but with the advent of fractional investment platforms, can be bought and sold just like stocks. Trading volumes however remain low.
3. Art assets do not generate cash flow

&amp;#x200B;

**How can a retail investor invest in art?**

1. **Use fractional investment platforms** like Masterworks, Otis, Maecenas, et al. These allow you to start investing with a few hundred dollars and gives you access to works by artists who have defined culture - Andy Warhol, Claude Monet, Basquiat, Kusama, and more.
2. **Join an art syndicate with friends and associates.** Most large art galleries run syndicates (special purpose entities in the form of partnerships) for their clientele to invest in a specific artwork.
3. **Invest in an art fund** like InArt, Atremundi, and Anthea. Investments starts from around $100,000.

80,investing,Sandbjerge,Options Strategy Feedback,"Hi All,

I’ve been trading on the stock market for around four months now. Most of that has been trading shares, but I’ve gotten into options during the past month. I’ve developed a strategy that has largely served me well, but I would love some advice/cautions/feedback.

The whole idea is to play off of rebounds of early morning drops.

I’ve compiled a list of around 50 companies, mostly well established (TGT, MA, MSFT, etc.), that I watch closely each morning. I watch to see which ones drop during the first ~2 hours of the day, especially drops that seem to happen for no reason. I wait for it to rebound slightly (compared to the drop), then I load up on ITM calls, which hopefully pick me up some cash. The following morning, if the stock is up sometime within 30 min of market open, I try to close the options, rinse, and repeat.

For example, look at MasterCard $MA from today (6/10). I waited for the morning drop to start to slow, before putting in a bunch of calls. I ended up buying slightly too early, but still managed to score towards the end of the day.

I also watch for companies that do very well in earnings (ones that beat their estimations) but show sudden drops anyways. 

Lastly, before dumping my money, I look at the chart over the past month. If it has been steadily increasing, or if it seems to be at a trough despite it being an established company, I feel more reassured.

This strategy has done me well so far, but I acknowledge that by putting all of my cash into calls I am taking some serious risk, which is largely why I make them ITM calls.

Let me know any thoughts, or if y’all have any feedback or questions, as I’m still very new to this and hoping to improve!",1628653389,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p256e8/options_strategy_feedback/
86,investing,th3cr1t1c,Intellectual Property and Valuation: Thoughts from an FP&amp;A Analyst,"**PREFACE:  This is information not advice.  I have no stake in how you choose to implement this information.  It is simply to dive a little further into a topic that comes up now and then around which there seems to be some misunderstanding.  Also note, that this is a discussion of valuation from a fundamentals perspective.  That is, any mention of valuation herein solely concerns the key metrics and methods related to the current, fair value of expected, forecasted performance, not what will be the company's value based on the possible outcomes of developments yet to be.**

**SECOND PREFACE (with apologies to Tolkien):** Reposted because half of the original post was somehow missing.

Recently I was responding to a question about valuation and someone raised the notion that tech companies are massively undervalued because of their dependence on intellectual property.  On reflection I thought of a more complete answer to that question, the short version of which is:

Business valuation is a triangulation of many different metrics, and most if not all of what we are looking for is in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  And most of the ""gotchas"" to that are found in the Notes to Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The argument went something like this:  *Fundamental valuation doesn’t capture the contributions of intellectual property and therefore significantly undervalues tech companies \[in particular\].*

While it’s true that intellectual property itself at the conceptual stage is not to be found on the balance sheets, it’s *not* true that its monetary impact is absent or unknowable from the financial statements.

First, note that every industry has intellectual property. Tech is not unique or new in this regard.  But every company's intellectual property is moot if it cannot be transformed into products and/or services that make money.  That is, after all, the goal of every business.

The tech companies that supposedly have ""huge"" IP value don't actually make that claim in their financial statements, first because internally generated IP is not a recordable asset, and second because even acquired intangibles don't account for much.  Consider this: Out of $323 billion in total assets, AAPL, who patents hundreds of things they never even bring to market, has not listed a dime of intangible assets on their balance sheet since 2017. Facebook's gross intangibles are $5 billion out of $159 billion in assets... insignificant. Amazon's gross intangibles (MRQ) are $6.4 billion out of $321 billion in assets.

You can't value internally developed IP, particularly not at some arbitrary potential future sales you think might materialize.  It's valued only once there are costs associated with patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.  In the case of Amazon, even among the acquisitions recorded in the 2020 10-K, occurring since 2018, merely $28 million of that $5.2 billion is actually associated with the IP &amp; R&amp;D costs...most of that is likely R&amp;D.  And guess what method is used to amortize it?  That's right... Discounted Cash Flow method.

It's certainly important to understand the role IP plays in these companies but we don't just throw out Tangible Book Value in our longer analysis of companies (or the market).  That's simply a starting benchmark, like a decision point, where you decide whether it's worth your time to do further analysis or simply out of the bounds you have set for whatever your investment criteria may be.

So how are we to think about this?  Well, the reason we ultimately care about intellectual property is only because of a company's ability to convert it into operating cash flow.   So when we think about companies that have been around for more than a few minutes and change—Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google (FAANG) all qualify—they must have some kind of paper trail, right?

At the end of the lifecycle of every intellectual property is a pot of money.  That's the goal.  Disney turns comic book characters into movies.  Apple turns [round rectangles](https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt) into iPhones.  Amazon turns one-click purchasing into endless shifts with no piss breaks... *These* are all measurable events recorded in the financial statements in some form or another.  

In this sense, when we go through a complete valuation exercise, soup-to-nuts, from Book Value to Fair Value, we *are* taking into account the company's history of turning IP into operating cash.

Tech companies like Apple, Netflix, Amazon, etc., all have products and services that went through this lifecycle.  You can see years of history of these companies converting intellectual property into cash flow.  You can see into the mouth of that funnel.  You see it in the relationship between SG&amp;A and Revenue, between PPE, Leases, headcount, inventory, and the like, and in the flow of money into and out of Retained Earnings.  The companies that are good at developing IP into profitable business segments grow, and thus grows the footprint of their Consolidated Financial Statements.

Every company exists to turn ideas into money.",1628649605,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p2469u/intellectual_property_and_valuation_thoughts_from/

Facebook's gross intangibles are $5 billion out of $159 billion in assets... insignificant. Amazon's gross intangibles (MRQ) are $6.4 billion out of $321 billion in assets.

So what's going on here?  Well, developed intellectual property exists as a product, and that exists as tangible inventories, supply chain, brand/channel/product marketing, etc.  Pipeline intellectual property exists as patents.  But you can't value internally developed IP at some arbitrary potential future sales you think might materialize.  It's valued only once there are costs associated with patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.  In the case of Amazon, of the $5.2 billion in acquisitions recorded in the 2020 10-K, occurring since 2018, $28 million of that $5.2 billion is actually associated with the IP &amp; R&amp;D costs...most of that is likely R&amp;D.

Disney turns Marvel IP into movies.  Apple turns designs into computers and iPhones.  Amazon turns ideas into warehouses with employees who work around the clock with no piss breaks, and so on... these are all recorded in financial statements.  These are all line items the company can and has put a number to.

If we think of a growth company, its economic moat is only as wide as the footprint of products and services that are the end purpose of the intellectual property lifecycle.  The end of that rainbow is a pot of money.  We understand that for a moat to get wider, the economic footprint should grow larger and we can see that footprint getting larger.  We can see SG&amp;A expense scale with Revenue.  We can see P/P/E, leases, etc., scale with heeadcount.   We can see money moving into and out of Retained Earnings, reflecting the Cash Flows from Operations that ideally grow with the breadth of the business's product mix, channel mix, moat, and so on.

So how does this then impact valuation overall?  Well, when we get to the issue of Fair Value, consider that the act of discounting future cash flows implicitly takes into account the company's historical track record of producing operating cash from cash generating assets and intellectual property pipeline.  So there is nothing in the comprehensive walk from Book Value to Fair Value that inherently undervalues tech companies.

Now it is sent to the House of Representatives, after which it will wait for an agreement on Biden's desk. The size of the package is $1 trillion, but only $550 billion will be directed directly from the federal budget. 

Package contents: 

• $110 billion - roads, bridges and other immediate infrastructure - according to the White House, now in the United States about 20% of roads and 45 thousand bridges are in poor condition. 

• $73 billion in clean energy - new power grids, electrification of public transport and the installation of charging stations for electric cars. 

• $66 billion - trains - to upgrade passenger and freight railways, build new stations. 

• $65 billion - high-speed Internet - bringing the Internet to rural and poor areas and lowering prices at the expense of government grants to providers. 

• $55 billion - water infrastructure - replacement of pipes and provision of drinking water. 

• $39 billion - other support for public transport. 

• $21 billion - treatment of soil and groundwater at old mines and gas production sites.

After the adoption of this package, discussions will begin on a larger plan for $3.5 trillion. It should include $726 billion for schools, $332 billion for affordable housing and another $198 billion for clean energy.

At the end of the day, I think companies like cmcsa and charter are best positioned to win this battle. In terms of cost, I don't think there is much they need to do to move from docsis 3 to 4. With docis 4, you could see speeds of up to 10gbps and pretty decent upload speeds. 5g also offers some promise as well, but I think it might take some time for these companies to catch up to cable companies. just curious to hear your thoughts",1628623598,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p1wcz5/which_broadband_company_do_you_like_over_the_next/

Sony [now owns both Crunchyroll and Funimation](https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2021/0809/sonysfunimationglobalgroupcompletesacquisitionofcrunchyrollfromatt). The company's Sony Pictures division completed the $1.175 billion acquisition on Monday. And with the deal now closed, Sony Pictures CEO Tony Vinciquerra said the company's goal is to ""create a unified anime subscription experience as soon as possible.""

Sony didn't say how soon we could see that happen and what form that ""experience"" will take. For the time being, Funimation and Crunchyroll will continue to exist as separate streaming platforms, with few details on what the deal means for subscribers.

""With the addition of Crunchyroll, we have an unprecedented opportunity to serve anime fans like never before and deliver the anime experience across any platform they choose, from theatrical, events, home entertainment, games, streaming, linear TV — everywhere and every way fans want to experience their anime,"" Vinciquerra said.

Sony first announced it was acquiring Crunchyroll from AT&amp;T [at the end of 2020](https://www.engadget.com/crunchyroll-acquired-by-funimation-003449882.html). At the time, the service said it had 3 million subscribers and over 90 million registered users across more than 200 countries. Less than a year later, Crunchyroll notes those numbers have increased to 5 million and 120 million, respectively.",1628614362,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p1t83w/sony_now_owns_both_crunchyroll_and_funimation/

**Greater-than-Expected Profit Driven by Accelerating Organic Revenue Growth and Scaling Operating Leverage**

**Completion of AdColony and Fyber Transactions During the Quarter Empower Differentiated Full-Stack, End-to-End Platform Capabilities and Strategically Position the Company for Significantly Larger Addressable Market Opportunity**

AUSTIN, Texas, Aug. 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Turbine, Inc. (Nasdaq: APPS) announced financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended June 30, 2021. All operating results discussed below, except as otherwise specifically noted, refer only to the continuing operations of the Company, and all comparisons to prior periods have been adjusted to reflect only continuing operations. The Company completed the acquisitions of AdColony Holdings AS and Fyber N.V. on April 29 and May 25, 2021, respectively. Therefore, the actual reported results discussed below, except as otherwise specifically noted, reflect only the partial contributions of those acquired businesses beginning on the dates the acquisitions closed. Specific references made to ""pro forma"" results in this release provide investors with quarterly results and comparisons as if all acquired businesses were owned for the entirety of the first quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. The Company believes that pro forma results, where applicable, can provide investors with more relevant year-over-year comparisons. The reconciliations between the pro forma and GAAP financial results for the relevant periods are provided in the tables following the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below.

**Recent Financial Highlights:**

* Fiscal first quarter of 2022 revenue totaled $212.6 million. On a pro forma basis, as if both Fyber and AdColony were owned for the full quarter, total consolidated pro forma revenue for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $292.0 million, representing a 104% increase year-over-year as compared to the comparable pro forma figure for the fiscal first quarter of 2021.
* GAAP net income for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $14.3 million, or $0.14 per share, as compared to GAAP net income of $9.9 million, or $0.11 per share for the fiscal first quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP adjusted net income1 for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $33.4 million, or $0.34 per share, as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted net income of $12.5 million, or $0.13 per share, in the fiscal first quarter of 2021.
* Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA2 for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $39.8 million, as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2021.

""We are off to a fast start in fiscal 2022 with more than 100% year-over-year pro forma revenue growth and more than 150% year-over-year growth in both EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS,"" said Bill Stone, CEO. ""Not only did we continue to showcase the inherent operating leverage of our platform model with our strong bottom-line performance, but even more importantly, we successfully completed the acquisition of full-stack, end-to-end platform capabilities that we believe strategically position the Company for continued prosperity well into the future. We are capitalizing on a unique opportunity to leverage our extensive on-device software presence and long-term partnerships with global carriers and OEMs to significantly expand our addressable app ecosystem market opportunity, and we are already witnessing a very positive initial reaction from advertisers all across the platform. We look forward to updating investors on the realized synergies for the Company and improved overall performance for app publishers and advertisers on the platform as fiscal 2022 progresses.""

So my question is, when does this repayment money end up make its presence known in asset prices?

 **Roscan Gold (RCGCF/ ROS.v)**

**Price: $0.25 US/ $0.33 CAD**

**Market Cap: $81M USD/ $106M CAD**  


**\*\*Price Target:  $3**

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** 

**Lets start with the coles notes for owning gold:**

&amp;#x200B;

Money printing is not new but the magnitude of recent printing among central banks around the world is unparalleled. If you are concerned by the fact that 40% of all US dollars in existence have been printed since 2020, precious metals are good hedge for the coming inflation. The US government has been printing massive amounts of new money. On January 6, 2020, the US Federal Reserve had around $4 trillion dollars. On January 4, 2021, the number increased to $6.7 trillion dollars. Money is usually a medium of change to facilitate the sale, purchase, or trade of goods between buyers and sellers. However, since there is no productivity (good and services) to back up the trillions of dollars currently in circulation, printing more money doesn’t necessarily increase the economic output (productivity), it only increases the amount of money circulating in the economy. Too much money in circulation chasing the same amount of goods leads to inflation. We have already witnessed the price of many commodities (lumber, copper, oil, etc) increase in price but gold is yet to increase at the same rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Central banks continue to replenish and build their official gold reserves as part of policy. Speculators, institutional investors and end-users will also be marginal sources of demand for the commodity. The purchasing power of our dollars is clearly diminishing. Do not be fooled into following CPI as a measure of inflation- because that is not at all the case (i encourage everyone to dig deeper into this on your own time). We have clearly seen the cost of everyday items spike higher as input costs have all gone up. Not to mention a progressive political movement that is moving towards higher minimum wages across the country. Which will eventually aggravate inflation pressures. 

The daily price swings in the underlying commodity shouldnt scare anyone. Many typical gold investors have temporarily been lured to crypto-currencies promising similar protection. Im not here to bash cyrpto. Its too volatile and has too many unknowns for me at this time. The gold life cycle is tried and proven. As a non-interest bearing asset, investors are always looking at the Fed Rate. Now consider again the MASSIVE amount of money that was just printed, the amount of debt taken on by the Fed is huge! The dirty little secret that sophisticated investors understand but the Federal Reserve will NEVER openly state is that rate will stay lower for longer in order to pay back and manage this new debt. Why would the federal reserve increase rates and force themselves to pay more in an unsustainable cycle. Another alternative is for The Fed to keep printing more and more, which will only diminish the value of our dollars further and create more supply of dollars in circulation.  If you read the investment letters of all the top investment managers across the spectrum, this is the consistent theme. (Happy to share where to access this if anyone has interest)

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, you dont have to go all-in YOLO on gold but at least get some exposure to it. But how?...

&amp;#x200B;

**2)**

**How to get gold exposure?**

Owning a combination of physical gold and gold equities is ideal. Physical gold can be bought and sold almost anywhere in the world for the going market rate. Owning paper gold (aka futures contracts) is not ideal for retail investors like us and it's no secret that this market is often manipulated.

&amp;#x200B;

For the largest potential reward, you want to own gold exploration companies that are early in the gold cycle, not yet producing gold. There are a number of reason why these are ideal bets:

\-as they are in the early stages, there are many catalysts that will slowly remove risk form their story and increase the stock price (positive drill results confirming resource quality, declaration of a maiden resource, building/securing of infrastructure, completing mine feasibility/economic studies). The goal is to find an exploration company that is most likely to check all these boxes and become an actual built gold mine and/or acquired by a Major (aka one of the large global mining companies).

\-Late stage producers are more affected by swings in the commodity price. While exploration companies have a set path to follow as they develop to the later stages.

\-Good exploration companies are harder to find, often overlooked by the market. 

\-You dont want to own broad junior mining ETFs because for every dollar you invest, you may get exposure to a handful of good companies but most of your invested dollars will be spread among risky and often garbage companies that would mean unnecessary risk.

&amp;#x200B;

If you can find an exploration company that ticks all the boxes, you will be handsomely rewarded. What do we look for?

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** 

**Roscan Gold (RCGCF/ ROS.v)**

**Price: $0.25 US/ $0.33 CAD**

**Market Cap: $81M USD/ $106M CAD**

&amp;#x200B;

Roscan Gold is gold exploration company has its flagship asset located in Southwest Mali, among the most favorable mining destinations in the world, whose camp is surrouned by other Major publicly traded Gold Miners with multi-million oz reserves and existing infrastructure. Within a 40KM radius of Roscans property we have the following immediate neighbours: B2Golds Fekola Mine (7M oz+), Barrick Golds Louolo/Gounkoto Mine (13M oz+), Allied GOlds Sadiola Mine (7M oz+). Roscans current land package is over 3.1X larger than the closest neighbouring B2Gold Fekola Mine which is important to note because this makes Roscan an ideal acquisition target for all of them. The worlds Major Miners have under-invested into new explroation projects over the last 10 years, and thus there is a gap in expected supply of the commodity- making proven companies in good jurisdictions attractive.  B2Gold would have liked to be approved for their nearby Anaconda exploration permit to feed into Fekola milling operation but the Mali government has recently revoked their request for a permit. B2Gold has also lowered their grade cutoff and increased their resulting production expectations at Fekola. The point being that B2Gold will likely look to Roscan in the near future. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were already in the data room.

&amp;#x200B;

The mgmt. team of Roscan is also impressive and most likely to execute. Nana Sangmuah, CEO, has 20 years of international mining and investment banking experience. Has a strong network of contacts within Mali and NA capital markets. Sir Samuel Jonah, Chairman of board, is the former CEO of Ashanti Gold. Greg Isenor, founder of ROS, discovered the nearby Sirabaya deposit and sold it to IAMGOLD. Michael Gentile, director on board, is a former portfolio manager of one of the largest mining and resource funds in Canada, he is a sophisticated investor and continues to be involved in the industry. This is not a pump and dump but in fact a real company with an elite team ready to build this mine or sell at a juicy price tag.

&amp;#x200B;

The quality of drill results is among the highest. As a rule of thumb anything above 1g/t is excellent grade. Roscan has much higher grades and across wide length and significant depth. Dont be tricked by ""1 meter"" width and high grades. That is a common trick used by pumpers to make the appearance of high grade results, there is no trickery here. This is a real asset, the company expects to announce a maiden resource in Q4 of this year.  

(please look at pg 9: [https://roscan.ca/site/assets/files/3999/20210727\_ros\_corporate\_presentation\_final.pdf](https://roscan.ca/site/assets/files/3999/20210727_ros_corporate_presentation_final.pdf))

 

In conclusion, ROSCAN is in an ideal jurisdiction, has an elite management team, solid institutional shareholder base,  consistently high-grade drill results, a meaningful asset about to be announced in the coming quarter. Following the recent trading activity and filings, indicates there has been clear selling pressure since mid-june. The gold equities have also been under pressure as we are in the middle of summer vacation season, and no marginal buyers are accumulating the stock yet. This recent pressure provide a doubly-juicy opportunity to own a deeply discounted explorer at floor prices, while we approach the end of selling pressure. Once that is relieved it will be difficult to accumulate stock. My price target on this stock is $3, i expect it will be hit there once the resource is announced and more developments made, by 2022. By end of year, i think the stock gets to $1.50-$2 easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

Buy while it's cheap.

This post will enlighten anyone curious about Edward Jones. Our ""salesman"" is a nice dude...

In total it's at 1.2 million. We have another ~400k cash to invest. Holdings are across stocks/mutual funds/ETF's. The inherited date is January 22, 2021. One is a traditional IRA which needs to be drawn over ten years. Taxes will be ""stepped-up"" from January right? Our ROR has been about 10% this year. 1.2% fee based model!

We are in our late 30's, moderate risk is fine, want long term-holdings, and don't want to think about this everyday/week. Vanguard Personal advisor is 0.3% which is attractive.

Main question: I wonder if changing to a different financial advisor, selling these funds, and dropping in to either VTI or VTSAX would be better. I'm not sure which mutual funds/stock to hold. Should we just talk to a fiduciary around town or Vanguard over the phone?? This situation sucks.

49,investing,ahavahlove,Getting ahead in Hearing aid investing before law is enacted. Good idea?,"Sonova Holdings: SONVY or SONVF

Biden recently issued an executive order to speed up the roll out of OTC hearing aids. And hope to start implementing otc between March-July 2022. 

The hearing aid market doesn’t seem to have a whole lot of investment activity compared to other health industry markets. There is an undeniable growth in the market share since this past year. In 2017 Congress passed a law that allows for over-the-counter hearing aids to be sold in the US because hearing aids are not covered in the ACA or Medicare. 
Hearing aid corporations have been very much against this idea of OTC hearing aids because they feel that hearing loss is very complicated (and it is). Most hearing aid companies saying that they have no interest in developing an otc hearing aid. Similar to OTC glasses you can buy at the pharmacy. 

Sonova Holdings is a behemoth in the hearing health industry and this past May 2021 they recently purchased a smart tech headphone/earbud company called Sennheiser. This purchase is in preparation for the OTC hearing aid rollout next year. 
Some other notable companies they own are: 
Phonak (pediatric hearing aids)
Unitron (micro hearing aids) 
Advanced Bionics (cochlear implants)
AudioNova (Europe’s largest hearing aid retailer) 

The acquisition of Sennheiser will definitely raise the bar for sound quality targeted toward hard of hearing individuals. The biggest dilemma in hearing loss is identifying which frequencies need to be amplified and which ones don’t. 

Pro: OTC hearing aids will reduce the stigma with hearing technology and open the door to costly prescription hearing aids. OTC is only intended to mild to moderate hearing loss. Individuals with persistent hearing loss will eventually need prescription hearing aids. 25 [states](https://www.asha.org/advocacy/state/issues/ha_reimbursement/) have supplemented the ACA with hearing aid coverage mandates for children and 5 of those states also cover adults. Insurance coverage for hearing aids continue to expand. 

Con: otc hearing aids could potentially take a large portion of the market share. Larger tech markets like Apple might try their hand at OTC Hearing Aids. There’s still stigma with hearing loss. 

Disclaimer: I don’t work for any tech company. I have a 6 year old who wears cochlear implants (CI). He was born deaf and at 9months old had a surgical procedure that inserted electrodes in his cochlea to make him hear synthetically (he speaks and hears really well). The first thing a parent or CI patient is told to do is to choose 1 of 3 Cochlear implant brands to have for the next 30 years. So you get very familiar with all of the brands from all of the initial research.  I’ve been keeping my eye on the market for some time.

However, when putting a buy order in on Merrill Edge, I was informed that neither are supported by Merrill and the buys would not execute.  When talking to a Merrill rep (who was super helpful overall), he informed me that the Carbon credit ETF is not allowed because it's an actively managed futures ETF and the uranium ETF was not available because of the political risk (that was more of a hypothesis by rep).

71,investing,Many-Coach6987,Should I suspend my retirement investment contract or not?,"Hi all,

As I am from Europe I try to explain as good as possible. In my country you can invest a monthly amount, say 100 bucks, and an insurer invests this money on the stock market. On top you receive a premium from the government. Sounds too good to be true, right? It’s supposed to be a tool for citizens to build for retirement.

But: Fees are high (administration, sales, ..) and returns have been very low. I did the math and likely this deal will make me 1,5% a year until I retire in 27 years. Before taxes though!

That is a very low return and I think I can beat this over the next 20+ years by simply ETF investment. I have two options now:

A) suspend contract: no more payments from me go into this contract, however I still have to pay some fees. In the end the amount already in my pension fund will continued to be invested for a poor 1,5% and will likely reach 30k in 27 years.

B) Cancel contract: I will get all the money back, minus premiums I have received and minus taxes I need to pay on current capital gains.

-&gt;If I cancel I get 10k net today. So i loose 20k immediately.
-&gt;If I simply suspend contract it will be worth 30k in 27 years

Would you take the 10k now and take the chance to make more than 30k in 27 years? This means I would take chance/risk of either outperforming this deal in place or screw up and do worse.

Technically I just need to wait for another big correction and buy an ETF, that should triple my investment alone. On the other hand I don’t want to feeds an insurer with fees for poor returns.

In such circumstances, we will seek to provide you with as much additional information as we can relating to the treatment of your existing Positions as and when we obtain it, but please be aware, **you could lose the value of your investment.** ""

&amp;#x200B;

The Securities Times reporter recently learned that as of now, HarmonyOS 2 has more than 40 million Huawei devices upgraded to adapt to HarmonyOS 2, the number of HarmonyOS developers has exceeded 1.2 million, and more than 300 Apps have joined the HarmonyOS ecosystem. In addition, since the release of HarmonyOS 2, a total of 65 kinds of devices have started the official version upgrade.

&amp;#x200B;

In general, users generally report that Huawei HarmonyOS 2 is stable and smooth in operation, pure and safe, and has longer battery life. Of course, some users said that they are not accustomed to some details of HarmonyOS 2 and that some old mobile phones have heat and application incompatibility after the update.

&amp;#x200B;

Some communication experts said that if you are an Android user, you can easily transition to Harmony, because both the interface and operating habits are similar. This shows that Huawei's development of Harmony itself is not to set another benchmark on the interface but to focus on customer experience.

&amp;#x200B;

[Context](https://www.westmoney10.com/share/stocknewsdetail?lang=en&amp;id=874287712780292096&amp;color=2&amp;downUr&amp;from=redditgroup2)

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, there are still more listed companies cooperating with Harmony.

&amp;#x200B;

In mid-July, Chipsea Technologies also disclosed that it had cooperated with HarmonyOS, which caused the company's stock price to rise sharply.

&amp;#x200B;

On August 3, Fenda Technology stated on the investor interactive platform that the elf learning smart screen produced by the company and H will equip with the HarmonyOS.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, recently Zhang Yunyong, general manager of the product center of China Unicom Group, also publicly disclosed that China Unicom is actively engaged in ecological cooperation with Harmony.

&amp;#x200B;

It is also understood that listed companies such as Yusys Technologies, Hoperun Software, Sumavision Technologies, and Hanbang Technology have all started cooperation with Harmony.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the US lawmakers called on the Commerce Department to add Honor to the ""Entity List"".

&amp;#x200B;

According to the press, 14 members of the U.S. House of Representatives asked the U.S. Department of Commerce to include the Honor Company on the government's economic blacklist. According to sources, a member of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Michael McCall, said in a letter that Honor has been spun off from Huawei, which was included in the US Entity List in May 2019. Companies included in the list are prohibited from purchasing parts or using American technology from American companies without the approval of the U.S. government.",1628489336,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p0vlam/harmonyos_2_has_been_released_for_two_months_the/

Been around for a long time without material success, changes in management, silence on the PR front for an embarrassing amount of time, etc. But when you read through the below, something must be going on behind the scenes if they just got a Department of Energy grant to pursue their Halloysite based battery technology... and we all know how insane the market is for new battery tech. Looking at their PPS compared to what a valuation could be for a winning battery technology is almost hard to comprehend. It's simply remarkable to read through some of the research that has been done showing how much Halloysite can improve battery performance. 

Here is some info on the grant specific use case. Applied Minerals was awarded a DOE grant to develop low cost/high performance anode material from its halloysite resource
 
You can read the general DOE announcement for yourself here. 
https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-awards-54-million-235-american-small-businesses-developing-novel-clean-energy-and
 
All of the companies that got awards can be found in the excel. Applied is noted in the second Phase 1 award release doc here  science.osti.gov/sbir/Awards 
 
Here is the description of the application the award was granted for:

""Domestic Halloysite-Derived Silicon as a Low-Cost High-Performance Anode Material for Li-Ion Batteries.  
 
To enable the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, the cost of lithium-ion battery electrode materials must be reduced. This proposal will enable commercial production of high-performance, low-cost battery electrode material through an innovative process derived from a unique domestic mineral resource found in Utah.""

Additionally here are some interesting research papers regarding the use of Halloysite in the advanced battery space. What is so remarkable is there are multiple Halloysite applications for the lithium battery space that are advancing beyond just the application the DOE is interested in

https://www.torquenews.com/1/tesla-and-toyota-work-ev-batteries-race-minerals

As I dig deeper, one more thing to note. The company seems to also be pursuing Halloysite applications beyond just the battery space such as flame retardants and molecular sieves just to name a few. My guess would be those applications could be a way to fund the battery development. They also have a massive Iron resources they seem to be mining and using as a cash engine.

So if we expect some kind of vaccine booster do you think that will skyrocket the stocks or crash the market? or is it priced in?

reasons for skyrocket:

it means that the vaccines still work for the most part and this is the way, instead of shutdowns and job losses and too much social distancing, the vaccine will be free and all we have to do is we export less, but still have enough production.

reasons for crash:

it means that they think the pandemic will go on longer than expected, and much of 3rd world countries still not close to vaccinated, they will have to delay some shipments to those countries. also it can make some people refuse to take the boosters.

reasons it will be priced in:

this is because i think it depends on how urgent they think it is. if they expand approval for 12 yr old and under first i think its just priced in because we know its going to be around that time anyway. also i think most people dont care so thats why it's priced in.",1628453959,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p0m410/do_you_think_booster_vaccine_approval_will/

The founders pioneered blockbuster anti-inflammatory drugs Remicade and Humira. Primary Active ingredient for Dupuytren’s Contracture is same drug already approved for another indication-Rheumatoid Arthritis the single largest market in pharmaceuticals. The founders discovered the biology behind anti TNF and are world famous academics including a winner of The Lasker Prize. Because the research was done on this P2B/ P3 on diseased human Dupuytren’s tissue the move straight to FDA drug submission upon proof of concept. Other indications being targeted in future in order are Frozen shoulder, POST Operative Cognitive Decline, NonAlcoholic Steatohepatitis (Fatty Liver Disease) and Ulcerative Colitis brought on by smoking cessation. Another pathway being targeted is pain and inflammation using SCA’s— synthetic cannabinol diet analogues. A founder is the Israeli scientist who first isolated THC and discovered the human endocannabinoid system. Also known as godfather of cannabis. But it’s synthetic and pure now think about pairing pain relief for musculoskeletal pain with the anti TNF meds proven effective on rheumatoid arthritis and consider that market. Get the picture. Now the CEO has a history of allowing data on patented medication to be released in academic setting. Current patents are probably worth more than stock price. Oxford is also home to founder Sir Ralph Winner of Lasker prize. So do you think anyone at FDA is denying a NDA for a medication already wildly successful for new indications for which there are no treatments? I don't think so.

# Synthetic CBD Analogs (SCAs)

180 Life Sciences aims to develop SCAs that are safe, non-psychoactive and formulated to improve efficacy and bioavailability – a real alternative to unregulated cannabidiol (CBD). This program is led by Professor Raphael Mechoulam, who discovered tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component in cannabis, and the endocannabinoid system. Typical botanical derived CBD contains impurities such as THC (the psychoactive compound within cannabis) and other minor cannabinoids. By developing SCAs, 180 Life Sciences will create a pure compound (&gt;99.5%) which offers accurate consistency across batches. Combined with novel formulations through use of patented ProNanoLipospheres (PNL), 180LS will deliver a superior CBD analogue that offers improved efficacy and bioavailability. These conditions create greater likelihood for obtaining regulatory approval.

My goal and the goal of the other members of management, is to benefit patients and build stockholder value by developing world leading products to solve unmet medical needs. As management and insiders currently own over 50% of the Company, we believe our goals are directly aligned with the stockholders of the Company.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*We are now looking forward and focused on execution. We are a team who have developed not one but many blockbuster drugs. Our goal for 180 Life Sciences is to execute on a model we all know well, building upon past success, experience, and relationships to bring our pipeline candidates to market. We look forward to working hard for our collective benefit and communicating with you regularly moving forward. Thank you again for your invaluable support.*

AZUL - Azul Airlines Brazil. Top ranked airline in the world by TripAdvisor. Balance sheet was so strong that they refused government aid during pandemic. Favorite to acquire LATAM airlines and become top South American carrier in near future.

BP - British Petroleum. Technical play with solid setup and 90% near term upside. Thank me in 5 weeks.

SIX - Six Flags. Attendance set summer records with ticket sales for 2021 summer exceeding 2019 numbers substantially. This will show up in Q3 and Q4 numbers in a big way. Domestic travel has been strong and six flags has been tearing it up from an attendance standpoint.

UGI - UGI Corporation is a large integrated natural gas supplier that most of you will know from the Amerigas brand. You know those bbqs that were firing up all summer now that we can see each other, yeah powered by UGI Corp. strong numbers coming in.

VVI - Viad Corporation is the largest convention company in the country. Any large convention from video game conventions to medical conventions to Vegas anything, chances are it was put on by Viad. They own great tourist properties in Banff Canada as well which were very popular pre covid and stand to benefit strongly from an bilateral open border coming very soon. As conventions continue to open back up this stock will boom.

GPMT - Granite Point Mortgage Trust is a wonderful technical play. It’s the gift that just keeps on giving. Real under the radar type stock that’s been steadily streaking higher day after day after day. They trade mortgages etc..

SPR - Spirit Aerosystems, not spirit airlines, produces all of the composite wing tips and bodies for Boeing airplanes. They have government contracts as well locked in through 2035. Terrific company with extremely high barriers to entry. Do plenty of airline repairs as well.

MCS - Marcus Corporation is the third largest cinema owner in the United States with a stellar presence in the Midwest. They own a series of high performing hotel properties as well and have a substantial fall coming up. Bond, Batman, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Marvel etc… It’s the healthiest box office play by far. If you’re buying a theatre company for the business instead of the short squeeze, MCS is far and away the top choice over AMC and Edwards etc.

JWN - Nordstrom’s has actually transitioned beautifully from just a big box retailer to an incredibly strong online fulfillment company.

42,investing,MuffinDewd,Real Estate Investments Question," Hey everyone. I’m pretty new to making investments, and by new I mean I genuinely know very little to nothing on this topic and I have a question that has always confused me.
Why is investing in real estate always so talked about and regarded as one of the best investments? People talk about making passive income when the property is rented out to others and all but this is what I consider. 

I live in Australia, so a property that would cost approximately $700,000 AUD would normally be placed for rent for about $900/fortnight. Why is real estate such a good investment considering it would take ages to make all that money back. 

(I might’ve gotten the figures wrong, everything is just an estimation but literally from everything i’ve seen it would take an extremely long amount of time for that money to be made back, even if loans were taken out to pay for the property originally, youd still have to make that money back to pay the bank)

It’d be really helpful if this was cleared up. Thanks!",1628443952,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p0iyy3/real_estate_investments_question/
45,investing,positiontrader2021,Inflation Fear Mongers Are Wrong - Treasury Yields Will Plummet,"Here's why, over the long-term, Treasury Yields are inversely correlated with Debt/GDP ratio. The more the government spends, the lower Treasury rates go (the opposite of what most people expect - don't believe me then go look at historical Treasury 10 year rates and Debt/GDP ratio since FDR suspended the gold standard in 1933). 

For Treasury rates to start trending higher over the long-run, either GDP will have to grow faster than the national debt or we have to cut spending dramatically (neither are happening under Biden). Until this upward trend in Debt/GDP reverses, Treasury yields will continue to head lower.

46,investing,green_stocks3,Tokyo Catalyst? 3 CBD Stocks Expanding Horizons to Sports Medicine," The Tokyo Olympics has been one of firsts, for both the right and the wrong reasons.  One novelty that has attracted international attention at this current Olympic Games has been the number of athletes admitting to using CBD as part of their training program.  Given the starkly divided stance of different countries on the use--medical or otherwise--of cannabis and cannabinoids, athletes use of CBD has generated no little controversy (think Sha’Carri Richardson’s suspension from the Games for testing positive for marijuana use; not CBD, but still indicative of how strict the rules still are).  

Officially,  in 2018 the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) removed CBD from its list of substances that are prohibited in or out of competition.  That said, ONLY CBD was removed from the prohibited list; the psychoactive component of marijuana, THC, is still prohibited.

Thus for the first time in the history of the Olympics, cannabidiol (CBD) has been allowed for use by elite athletes. There’s a lot of solid science behind CBD laying out its medical properties in tandem with it becoming gradually more socially acceptable to use for health, lifestyle, or in this case, elite athletics.

Right off the bat there are a number of obvious benefits in applying CBD to the field of sports medicine and athletics, such as:

* CBD is calming and can help quell general anxiety. There's stress in sports participation, so reducing anxiety without physical side-effects is key for ensuring peak game-day performance.
* CBD can help athletes with sleep without the use of downers or heavy sleep drugs.  Especially in the context of the Olympic, where athletes travel from all over the world to compete, CBD can be used as an organic way to overcome jet-leg and make-up sleep debt prior to performance.
* CBD can also help athletes with pain management.  In search of improved sports recovery and safer pain relief, many people are seeking out CBD as an alternative to over-the-counter pain relievers (i.e NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen sodium).  Although CBD cannot remedy severe pain, it can be useful in easing the delayed onset of muscle stiffness after sport or just the general aches and pains that come with being an athlete.

These three particular ways CBD can help athletes can also be beneficial to the general public, hence the enormous therapeutic and medical potential of this substance that is just beginning to be realized by industry.  

And now lets take a look at the current market:

Over recent years, the CBD market has exploded. The global cannabidiol market was valued at USD 2.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.2% from 2021 to 2028.  Due to its healing properties, the demand of cannabidiol (CBD) for health and wellness purposes is high, which is the major factor driving the market growth. By 2023, Europe’s CBD market is set to rise by 400 per cent, according to Brightfield Group, a leading consumer insights and market intelligence firm for the legal CBD and cannabis industries.

CBD-infused goods are being widely used in industries such as beauty, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and personal care (among others) and technology has a big role to play in developing the CBD market. 

One company pioneering the use of CBD for sports medicine is Innocan Pharma(CSE: INNO) (FSE: IP4) (OTCQB: INNPF).  These guys are a pharmaceutical tech company that focuses on the development of CBD-delivery platforms and topical solutions for a wide range of health, cosmetic, and general weallness purposes. Their R&amp;G Relief &amp; Go CBD Spray is one product in particular that combines the known benefits of active ingredients such as Menthol and Camphor with CBD and Magnesium (more than 40% in the formula) to help the body relax and recover for sport-performing professionals.

Charlotte's Web (TSE:CWEB)(OTC:CWBHF) is another innovator in the field of CBD sports medicine.  They offer a wide range of products organized according to symptom (e.g. exercise induced inflammation, sleep issues, etc) that can be customized to respond to the athlete’s (elite or amateur alike) specific needs.  cbdMD (NYSE:YCBD) has assumed a similar course, with a wide range of CBD topicals and ingestibles already on the market.

To wrap it all up, Tokyo is giving a platform for advocates of CBD like none other before.  We all know how powerful endorsements from world-class athletes can be in terms of normalizing the novel.  As a dedicated cannabis investor and enthusiast, I’m pumped (from a financial and also personal angle) to see how leaders in pharma and medicine harness the full potential of CBD in years to come.

The lawsuit was initiated on Friday by Beijing’s Haidian district people’s procurator-ate against Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems, according to a filing posted on JCRB.com, a website run by China’s top prosecutor, Reuters reported.

The document did not say how WeChat’s “youth mode” broke Chinese law. It said it could support other agencies and organizations that intended to bring lawsuits against the Tencent unit and asked them to contact the prosecutor’s office within 30 days.

Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WeChat’s “youth mode”, when turned on, limits young users’ access to some games and functions, such as payments or finding nearby friends.

Chinese authorities have called for minors to be better protected from online dangers, a sentiment echoed by state media this week which criticised the video gaming industry as well as online platforms that help promote celebrity culture.

Tencent on Tuesday announced new curbs on minors’ access to its flagship video game, Honor of Kings, after its shares were battered by a state media article that described online games as “spiritual opium”.

Reuters reported in April that China was preparing a substantial fine for Tencent as part of its sweeping antitrust clampdown on the country’s internet giants. But it is likely to be less than the record $2.75 billion penalty imposed on Alibaba.

I just wanted to get peoples opinions on the topic from what they have gathered or their perspectives on the situation. I use EDU ( New Oriental Education ) because it is the largest tutoring company and the one I am following the most, but this applies to TAL and other firms as well. 

So here, is what I have researched so far. The first thing is I have read a lot of new stories say is that all tutoring companies will have to go no-profit. From everything I have read that is not an accurate description. Companies that continue to teach "" core curriculum "" after the legislation will have to go into non-profit and are not allowed foreign investors. The non-profit label will not have to apply to establishments teaching non-core curriculum. Core being Ethics, rule of law, culture, history, math science and foreign language. Non-core being sports, health, art, music, fine arts, information technology, computer programing and non-academic skills. Not to mention, Vocational education and tutoring for adults and college students. 

Moreover, in the reports that I have read the policies will be enacted through pilot cities Beijing, Shangai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Changzhi, Weihai and Nantong. All other provinces shall select at least one pilot city. From every report that I have read this will affect at least 75% of most business's. Some business like EDU in particular it will have less than a 60% or less effect. EDU is currently making a pivot in their curriculum I recently read as early as yesterday that they are going to be offering new classes that fall under non-core curriculum. 

I just wanted to post this to have a discussion on the topic. Please feel free to add anything or debate any of the points I have made.",1628389281,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p06del/edu_stock_and_chinese_tutoring_regulations/

36,investing,MrComedy325,5 Things Investors Should Know Before Investing In A Metaverse Company,"1) Metaverse Popularity Soars After Zuckerberg Remarks

During the recent earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook (Nasdaq: FB) would transform from a social media company to a metaverse company.

Definition: Metaverse refers to the sum of all the experiences in the digital and virtual worlds. It’s a concept that has been around for nearly 30 years, but it has picked up steam in the past few years as tech companies imagine new ways for people to live, work and play in a computer-simulated environment.

Popularity Upswing: According to Google Trends, searches for the word ‘metaverse’ have more than doubled since last week’s Facebook earnings call.

Facebook’s Role: Zuckerberg identified two potential ways for Facebook to capitalize on its investments in the metaverse: virtual reality devices and advertisements for digital goods.

Back to Reality: Facebook’s bet on the metaverse could pay off for the company and for investors, but it could take years before it comes to fruition.

Final Thoughts: In addition to Facebook, there are also other companies - both public and private - that are developing metaverse technologies. Details about investment opportunities in the metaverse will be shared every day this week on Early Bird.

2) Metaverse Investing: Stocks &amp; ETFs

Metaverse, a term that means the sum of all experiences in the digital and virtual, worlds, has taken off in 2021 as a focus area for retail investors.

Facebook (Nasdaq: FB) is one company that has already announced plans to position the company more in the metaverse. But for investors looking for metaverse options outside of FAANG, there are several options.

Big Player: Video game software development company Unity Software Inc. (NYSE: U) has positioned itself as a force in the metaverse. Unity’s technology makes it easier for people to develop video games, but the company is not profitable yet.

Sleeper: Tech company Nvidia Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA) is aiming to take the metaverse by storm. Nvidia released NVIDIA Omniverse in December, which is like a metaverse for engineers and creators. It’s an open, cloud-native platform that allows users to create workflows.

Big Content: Entertainment companies will play a role in the metaverse. Disney (NYSE: DIS) is reportedly aiming to create a theme park metaverse powered by AI and the internet of things.

Digital Currency: In the metaverse, users will be able to buy things with digital assets, such as cryptocurrency. This is good for crypto stocks such as Coinbase Global (Nasdaq: COIN).

Final Thoughts: If you prefer funds instead of individual stocks, there’s the new Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF, which was just released last month.

3)  Metaverse Startups Try Equity Crowdfunding

RiseAngle, an immersive gaming company that is also working on non-fungible token (NFT) games, is launching an equity crowdfunding campaign on September 15. There’s also a ‘Friends Invest First’ round that is already underway on the platform Wefunder.

This company falls into the category of the metaverse, a term that means the sum of all experiences in the digital and virtual worlds. This includes virtual reality providers.

Here’s a list of past and present equity crowdfunding campaigns in this space:

Business: Tocca, a company focused on business virtual events, launched an equity crowdfunding campaign on Wefunder in July.
Gaming: AEXLAB, a virtual reality technology studio, launched an equity crowdfunding campaign on StartEngine in July.

Shopping: Performlive, a commerce platform that includes augmented reality shopping, launched a crowdfunding campaign on Republic in July.

Let's Rewind: MyndVR, a health care virtual reality company, completed a $166,000 equity crowdfunding round in April.
Final Thoughts: As more metaverse startups launch, there will likely be more equity crowdfunding campaigns in this industry.

4) NFT Stocks For Retail Investors

As more public and private companies chase virtual reality, there’s also a clear link between the metaverse, which is a technical term meaning the sum of experiences in the digital and virtual worlds, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Definition: An NFT is effectively a unique digital asset that represents real-world assets, including collectibles, art, music and videos.
Bubble or Opportunity: More people have invested in NFTs in 2021. Some may call it a bubble, but the technology could introduce more people to the concept of the metaverse.

Data: The global metaverse market is expected to increase from $46 billion to $280 billion by 2025, according to Strategy Analytics.

Stocks To Invest In: If you really believe in NFTs, here are some stocks that are dipping their toes into NFTs: DraftKings (Nasdaq: DKNG), Dolphin Entertainment (Nasdaq: DLPN), Mattel (Nasdaq: MAT).

5) Metaverse's Potential Depends On The Government

As the metaverse (a term referring to the sum of experiences in the virtual world) becomes a popular investing trend in 2021, the success of the metaverse depends largely on the actions - or inactions - of government.

Alliance: South Korea took a proactive approach to the metaverse by launching an alliance of companies and researchers aimed at creating a national platform to support augmented reality.

Laws: Let’s face it, the laws of our world are not likely to keep up with the metaverse, so governments around the world might attempt to create new laws to match it. This might impact the innovations we have seen in both the public and private markets regarding virtual reality.

The Alternative: If the government doesn’t nurture or regulate the metaverse, then large companies that invested in the metaverse, such as Facebook (Nasdaq: FB), will control it. Do you really want Facebook to control this new world?

Final Thoughts: Will governments support the metaverse, such as what South Korea did, or not?

Let's Rewind: MyndVR, a health care virtual reality company, completed a $166,000 equity crowdfunding round in April.
Final Thoughts: As more metaverse startups launch, there will likely be more equity crowdfunding campaigns in this industry.

4) NFT Stocks For Retail Investors
As more public and private companies chase virtual reality, there’s also a clear link between the metaverse, which is a technical term meaning the sum of experiences in the digital and virtual worlds, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Definition: An NFT is effectively a unique digital asset that represents real-world assets, including collectibles, art, music and videos.
Bubble or Opportunity: More people have invested in NFTs in 2021. Some may call it a bubble, but the technology could introduce more people to the concept of the metaverse.
Data: The global metaverse market is expected to increase from $46 billion to $280 billion by 2025, according to Strategy Analytics.
Stocks To Invest In: If you really believe in NFTs, here are some stocks that are dipping their toes into NFTs: DraftKings (Nasdaq: DKNG), Dolphin Entertainment (Nasdaq: DLPN), Mattel (Nasdaq: MAT).

5) Metaverse's Potential Depends On The Governement
As the metaverse (a term referring to the sum of experiences in the virtual world) becomes a popular investing trend in 2021, the success of the metaverse depends largely on the actions - or inactions - of government.
Alliance: South Korea took a proactive approach to the metaverse by launching an alliance of companies and researchers aimed at creating a national platform to support augmented reality.
Laws: Let’s face it, the laws of our world are not likely to keep up with the metaverse, so governments around the world might attempt to create new laws to match it. This might impact the innovations we have seen in both the public and private markets regarding virtual reality.
The Alternative: If the government doesn’t nurture or regulate the metaverse, then large companies that invested in the metaverse, such as Facebook (Nasdaq: FB), will control it. Do you really want Facebook to control this new world?
Final Thoughts: Will governments support the metaverse, such as what South Korea did, or not?

A P/E ratio is the ratio of market capitalization to profits. This indicates the average dollar in the stock market only turns a 3.3% profit on the books of companies. Obviously speculation is part of the stock market so one would expect a price to earnings ratio of greater than 12.5 or 8% yearly returns, however, there seems to be too much speculation. I don't think companies are going to become    profitable enough to warrant such a high level of speculation. There is definitely a bubble in many tech stocks in my opinion Tesla being the most extreme example in my opinion has a p/e of 365 and a market cap of nearly 700 billion meaning that they are not only a massive company, but also most likely wildly over valued. The feds ability to do market intervention is declining by the day due to the use of qe and near 0 interest rates. I am concerned about this bubble popping causing a significant loss in confidence which the fed would have a limited ability to react against.

17,investing,Corporal_Peacock,When do you increase your position?,"This post ended up longer than expected. If you want the details, see further below. However, here is the final paragraph and question to serve as a TLDR.

&gt; **TLDR;**

&gt; Therefore, the basic question I started this post to ask is, when is the time to consider increasing your position in a company, when the initial investment isn't behaving in the way you expected? How do you determine when to increase your position when a stock is on an upturn? Or do you never buy more shares until there is a pause or downturn in the price?

I approach this question believing each investment opportunity is its own unique animal. There's not a one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Obviously, initiating and adding to a position in $VTI is going to have a different rationale than $MSFT or $HOOD.

For my investment philosophy, the majority of my capital is invested in the broad market (low cost ETFs or mutual funds) for the long term. I add to these regularly without any real regard to the current price. Just buy and wait. So, I have experience with this sort of long-term investment strategy and use it for the bulk of my portfolio.

On the other hand, I also maintain a small, but not trivial, amount of money for ultra-short-term trading, in which holding a position may last for a few hours up to a few weeks. These are usually Investments in long call options for when I see the potential for large growth within a short period of time. Although my record on the trades have yet to be proven in the long-run, so far they've ranged from catastrophic to middling. I'm hoping to research and learn and develop better strategies over time.

The strategy that I haven't tried yet, but that I'm finding myself needing a crash course in, is what I'd refer to as middle-term investing/trading. I recently found a company in a sector that I've been wanting to invest. It is doing work in an area I believe has much potential for looking-term development and grow. The corporate leadership has qualities that I admire and feel are socially responsible and progressive. The company recently had an IPO.

I initiated a modest position (3% of my overall portfolio value) in the company last week, with the plan incorporate the company as an intermediate to long-term addition, and either adding to the position if the company seems to be heading in the right direction or closing the position if it didn't seem to get its footing after a year or so.

However, in the week since I initiated the position, the stock has increased in value by nearly 60%. I don't think this was generally anticipated and it certainly wasn't what I foresaw. I can't locate any news or information that would explain or justify the price action, and I get uncomfortable when large unexplained movements happen in a price, good or bad.

So, I have to figure out what's going on and what should I do.

Is this a pump-and-dumps, meme stock, or trading fervor? If so, then I should calculate an exit point, close the position, count my blessings for my windfall, then re-evaluate the company again once the shenanigans subside.

On the other hand, is this a potentially great company in which people are simply excited to invest? Sure, there will be the inevitable pullbacks as people lock up gains, but will this company continue to have an overall upward trajectory and with it a huge upside? In that case, I would want to be increasing my position as soon as possible on the chance that I'm on the ground floor of a great investing opportunity.

Therefore, the basic question I started this post to ask is, when is the time to consider increasing your position in a company, when the initial investment isn't behaving in the way you expected? How do you determine when to increase your position when a stock is on an upturn? Or do you never buy more shares until there is a pause or downturn in the price?",1628277844,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ozdma2/when_do_you_increase_your_position/

When analyzed over time, coupled with other economic and market indicators, it has notable worth as a predictor of stock market bubbles.

The [S&amp;P 500 P/B ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-book), rocketing to 4.73, up \~57% from March of 2020, is approaching levels not seen since just before the April 2020 market crash—in which the total market, continuing to decline into 2001-2002, lost 75% of its value from its 2000 high.  An increase in the gap between price and tangible book is often correlated with an increase in downward price pressure. That is, the further a given stock departs from its book value, the more likely it is to decline sharply in market price, particularly in response to market-wide adverse impacts, versus those securities trading closer to their book value.  And so, the degree to which prices have deviated *rapidly* from overall book value, notably comparable to the increases in P/B just before the crashes of 2000 and 2008, is certainly cause for concern.

Other indicators, including the [Shiller P/E](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) (which previously surpassed 31 in 1929 and 2000), [Reverse Repos](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000), and [Total Credit to Nonbank Borrowers](https://www.bis.org/statistics/gli.htm) strongly suggest that excess capital liquidity is driving most of these excess valuations which are not at all tracking corresponding growth in operating cash flows or tangible book value.  In sum, cheap money is driving stock prices into the stratosphere disproportionate to actual performance.  This would not be an issue if the capacity of institutional investors to borrow were unlimited, but of course it is not.

This tracks with Piketty's argument that when the return on capital exceeds the actual growth in the economy, income inequality widens and trends toward a bubble.

If the next FOMC meeting in September does not produce changes in monetary policy to more sharply curb the excess liquidity injected into global capital markets since the beginning of the pandemic, we could trend past the Shiller P/E high in 2000, which might suggest an even larger crash looming.",1628265654,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oz9lis/sp_500_pricetobook_ratio_approaching_pre2000/

**THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- JULY 2021**

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 943,000 in July, and the unemployment rate declined by 0.5 percentage point to 5.4 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, in local government education, and in professional and business services.

**Household Survey Data**

The unemployment rate declined by 0.5 percentage point to 5.4 percent in July, and the number of unemployed persons fell by 782,000 to 8.7 million. These measures are down considerably from their highs at the end of the February-April 2020 recession. However, they remain well above their levels prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (3.5 percent and 5.7 million, respectively, in February 2020). (See table A-1. See the box note at the end of this news release for more information about how the household survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)

Among the unemployed, the number of persons on temporary layoff fell by 572,000 to 1.2 million in July. This measure is down considerably from the high of 18.0 million in April 2020 but is 489,000 above the February 2020 level. The number of permanent job losers declined by 257,000 to 2.9 million in July but is 1.6 million higher than in February 2020. (See table A-11.)

The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) decreased by 560,000 in July to 3.4 million but is 2.3 million higher than in February 2020. These long-term unemployed accounted for 39.3 percent of the total unemployed in July. The number of persons jobless less than 5 weeks increased by 276,000 to 2.3 million. (See table A-12.)

The labor force participation rate was little changed at 61.7 percent in July and has remained within a narrow range of 61.4 percent to 61.7 percent since June 2020. The participation rate is 1.6 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The employment- population ratio increased by 0.4 percentage point to 58.4 percent in July and is up by 1.0 percentage point since December 2020. However, this measure is 2.7 percentage points below its February 2020 level. (See table A-1.)

Among those not in the labor force who currently want a job, the number of persons marginally attached to the labor force, at 1.9 million, was little changed in July but is up by 435,000 since February 2020. These individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was 507,000 in July, down by 110,000 from the previous month but 106,000 higher than in February 2020. (See Summary table A.)

**Household Survey Supplemental Data**

In July, 13.2 percent of employed persons teleworked because of the coronavirus pandemic, down from 14.4 percent in the prior month. These data refer to employed persons who teleworked or worked at home for pay at some point in the last 4 weeks specifically because of the pandemic.

**Establishment Survey Data**

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 943,000 in July, following a similar increase in June (+938,000). Nonfarm payroll employment in July is up by 16.7 million since April 2020 but is down by 5.7 million, or 3.7 percent, from its pre-pandemic level in February 2020. In July, notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, in local government education, and in professional and business services. (See table B-1. See the box note at the end of this news release for more information about how the establishment survey and its measures were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.)

In July, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 11 cents to $30.54, following increases in the prior 3 months. Average hourly earnings for private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees also rose by 11 cents in July to $25.83. The data for recent months suggest that the rising demand for labor associated with the recovery from the pandemic may have put upward pressure on wages. However, because average hourly earnings vary widely across industries, the large employment fluctuations since February 2020 complicate the analysis of recent trends in average hourly earnings. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)

In July, the average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.8 hours. In manufacturing, the average workweek increased by 0.2 hour to 40.5 hours, and overtime was unchanged at 3.2 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.2 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)

The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for May was revised up by 31,000, from +583,000 to +614,000, and the change for June was revised up by 88,000, from +850,000 to +938,000. With these revisions, employment in May and June combined is 119,000 higher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)",1628262955,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oz8odk/jobs_report_943k_vs_845k_expected/
49,investing,lviathebunny,Zillow Q2 beats expectations. Potential good long buy?,"Summary of Q2

Zillow reported $1.3 billion in revenue Thursday for the second quarter, slightly beating analyst’s expectations.

Expected revenue was $1.28 billion, with earnings per share of 24 cents.

  Consolidated net income was $10 million.

The company’s mobile apps and websites saw 229 million average monthly unique users in the second quarter, representing a 5% year-over-year increase. This drove visits to 2.8 billion, up 10% year-over-year.

The company ended the quarter with cash and investments totaling $4.6 billion.

Personal Notes:

1. Who can compete with Z?
2. Can they take over real-estate business in the long-term with direct home sales?
3. Does any other company have a sophisticated algo designed to buy homes like Z does?

50,investing,redpepper20,Vistagen Therapeutics ($VTGN),"Wanted to hear peoples thoughts on Vistagen.

They are currently in the middle of phase 3 clinical trials for a new anxiety drug called PH94B. 

It is a nasal spray used on-demand in anticipation of anxiety provoking events (similar to how an inhaler is used to treat asthma)

The drug has a new mechanism of action that is different from benzos, and has shown to have minimal side effects and be non-addictive in trials thus far.

Here are more resources about PH94B:

Vistagen also has another drug (PH10) in phase 2 trials that uses a similar mechanism of action to treat depression.

Depression and anxiety are two major areas of need in the world today. Many drugs that are currently approved to treat these disorders dont work well or have significant side effects. These new drugs could be game changers, and since the market for these drugs is so big, Vistagen could be primed for major growth over the long term.

These are quality companies that have great products and a long history of making money.  Though for one reason or another their earnings this quarter did not meet analyst's expectations.

In my years of following the stock market, I find individual stocks and the entire market itself tend to overreact to both good and bad news.  Once investors calm down and determine that the company that did not meet analysts' expectations is still making lots of money, has great products, and a profitable future, the price quickly recovers.

People have been saying the ADR/VIE structure is dangerous because technically you own a shell company in the Cayman Islands and not the actual company and there’s no protection for you as an investor.. which I admit is fair and true. 

But people on here for whatever reason don’t realize both of these companies trade in Hong Kong, on the Hong Kong Exchange (H-Shares) Tickers: HK0700 and HK9988.. 

Owning the H-Shares is actually owning a piece of the company and you are taking a piece of risk off the table. If the US ever decided to delist, they’d be delisting the ADR’s, they have no jurisdiction over the H-Shares. If China ever decided to pull the companies out of US Markets, again, that only affects the ADR’s and not the H-Shares..

Point being, not investing in these two companies for that reason alone is not a good reason. You don’t like China? Don’t like Chinese stocks for various other reasons? Fine.. but there are other safer ways to buy shares of the companies..

19,investing,Tough-Positive,"Innovators in Pharma Sectors See Potential, Promise in Providing Improved Treatments"," 

NEW YORK, Aug. 5, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- A leading cause of death in the United States for men and women of most racial and ethnic groups, heart disease is a pervasive health challenge that destroys lives. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that one person dies every 36 seconds from cardiovascular disease. Treating the disease, **as well as the conditions related to it such as high blood pressure, or hypertension, is a** top priority for those in the medical space, and innovative companies are looking for ways to provide even more effective treatments. A leader in hypertension innovation, **Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (**NASDAQ: LEXX**) (**Profile**)** is focused on using its patented DehydraTECH(TM) drug delivery to identify safe and affordable treatments to the approximately 108 million, or almost one-half, of American adults dealing with high blood pressure. Innovation is a key characteristic of any successful company working in the pharma space, and other companies that are recognized as innovation leaders include **Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc** (NASDAQ: JAZZ), **Johnson &amp; Johnson** (NYSE: JNJ), **United Therapeutics Corporation** (NASDAQ: UTHR) and **Abbott Laboratorie**s (NYSE: ABT).

* **Hypertension is a primary risk factor for heart disease, a leading cause of death in** **the United States.**
* **Lexaria is an innovator in the space, developing potential treatments utilizing its proprietary** **DehydraTECH technology.**
* **LEXX has identified three main areas to focus on, including pharmaceuticals and the treatment of heart disease.**
* **Early reports from the company's most recent human clinical study show DehydraTECH technology demonstrated rapid, sustained drop in blood pressure.**

**Hypertension News Isn't All Bad**

**While the CDC reports that** nearly half of all adults in the United States, or 108 million, have hypertension, only about 24% of those have their condition under control. In fact, many don't even know they have it. **Yet controlling blood pressure is critical to good health.**

High blood pressure is often a primary or cause of death in almost 500,000 deaths a year, with hypertension potentially doubling the risk of a heart attack and quadrupling the chance of having a stroke; the condition can also increase the chances of heart failure, vision loss, renal disease, dementia, peripheral artery disease, and more. And it's not just a problem for ""old-people""; nearly one in four adults between the ages of 20 to 44 have high blood pressure. **In addition,** high blood pressure costs the United States about $131 billion each year.

But the news isn't all bad. Hypertension can be managed — and even cured — with proper diagnosis and treatment. It should come as no surprise then that the global anti-hypertensive drug market is projected to grow from $24.17 billion in 2020 to $27.81 billion in 2025. Even with current hypertension drugs available, only 24% of the 108 million people in the U.S. with high blood pressure have their condition under control. It's a market ripe for innovation**.**

**Drug-Delivery Platform Shows Exciting Potential**

Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (NASDAQ: LEXX) looks to be a leader in some of the most exciting innovation happening in the treatment of high blood pressure. The Kelowna, British Columbia-based company has identified, developed and patented a new drug-delivery platform. The proprietary tech, called DehydraTECH technology, has been proven to increase the speed of onset, bioavailability, and potency of a variety of substances.

The mechanics involve combining an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) with fatty acid oil and then applying the mix to carrier particles, which can be common ingredients such as tapioca starch or gum arabic. Next, a patented dehydration synthesis procedure is completed, resulting in a powder or liquid that can be used in the desired final form factor, such as a pill, tablet, chewable or oil.

Recognizing the potential for this new innovation, Lexaria has worked  with National Research Council of Canada, the biggest R&amp;D organization in the country, since 2017. The partnership has focused on defining the qualities of DehydraTECH, including that Nuclear Magnetic Resonance molecular characterization suggests DehydraTECH does not change the chemical structure of an API it delivers. This is essential when considering reliance on original API safety data in developing novel delivery methods without starting from scratch regarding the FDA process, which opens the door to a faster path to market.

Bottom line, this means that DehydraTECH could make lower doses of some substances more effective while potentially reducing side effects**.** With this in mind, the company has identified three areas in which to focus ongoing research and development; one of those areas is pharmaceuticals and the treatment of heart disease.

**Early Study Results Confirm DehydraTECH Promise**

As part of that R&amp;D, Lexaria recently released results from a human clinical study using DehydraTECH technology that indicated a rapid and sustained drop in blood pressure along with excellent tolerability. ""We are very encouraged by these early results in our 2021 hypertension program,"" said Lexaria CEO Chris Bunka. ""Lexaria's technology enabled a rapid and sustained drop in blood pressure, especially systolic pressure and particularly in stage 2 hypertensive volunteers.""

The early report noted that initial study results show a reduction in blood pressure in both male and female volunteers; the decrease was most pronounced in the first 10–50 minutes of the study treatment, reinforcing pre-existing findings demonstrating that DehydraTECH delivers superior performance over generic controls. Lead investigator on the study Dr. Phil Ainslie reported that ""these early results are extremely promising in this at-risk hypertensive population and provide a fundamental support for expansion into more prolonged repeat dosing and future longer term clinical trials.

**Diversification Creates Widespread Interest**

In addition to its work on heart disease and hypertension, Lexaria is also studying the potential impact DehydraTECH might have on reduced-risk noncombusted nicotine and improved antiviral drug delivery. Several successes in the company's diverse pipeline have been reported, in including in the antiviral program where DehydraTECH was used to process compounds from leading drugs used for antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS. This work holds particular promise in the current treatment of COVID-19 as well as looking forward and being better prepared in the future for future, inevitable pandemic situations**.**

The potential for use in a diverse group of market opportunities could create widespread interest in DehydraTECH possibilities. An example is today's antivirals market, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic and the circulating delta variant; the market is currently estimated at $52.1 billion with projections to reach $66.7 billion by 2025. And that is only the beginning; DehydraTECH's versatility points to many other potential applications, including human hormones (e.g., testosterone and estrogen replacement, a $21.9 billion market); oral mucosal nicotine (global smokeless tobacco products market valued at $13.6 billion in 2018); vitamin D3 ($1.1 billion market); PDE5 inhibitors ($4.4 billion market in 2014); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories ($15.6 billion market in 2019).

**Success Follows Innovation in Pharma Space**

Lexaria is leading the way in hypertension innovation, where research and discovery could not only save lives but also deliver significant profits. The $92.4 billion cardiovascular drug market generates billions of dollars every year for successful drug makers. Other big pharma companies are looking to innovate in other promising markets as well.

23,investing,5oclockpizza,Trying to understand Personal Rate of Return with company retirement account.,"I have a retirement account with TIAA and I can't tell if they calculate my contributes into the rate of return.  If they do, then I feel the rate is being illustrated as higher than it actually is.  This is their language on how they calculate the return rate:

*Your personal rate of return is the amount gained or lost divided by cash flow, which includes your contributions or withdrawals.
 
The contributions or withdrawals are aggregated each month and then time-weighted to the 15th of the month. This estimates the changes in your balance compared to market movement.
 
Here's an example with a contribution:
 
Beginning balance (January 1st):                      $100,000.00
       Contribution in March:                        +$15,000.00
               Weighted contribution          $11,958.90
     Market gain                                             +$20,000.00
Ending balance (December 31st):                       $135,000.00
Personal annualized rate of return:                          17.9%

In this example, there is a $15,000 contribution made in March, and calculated as of  the 15th of March, which creates an annual weighting multiple of .7973. This represents the net market movement divided by the amount of the balance affected by the market movement.
 
Here’s the formula of the actual calculation:
 
PRR = (Ending balance - beginning balance - total cash flow)                
Divided by: (Beginning balance + total weighted cash flow)
Multiplied by: 100*

I understand you have to add the amount of the contributions to the base for the return, but I think they are saying my contributions are counted as returns, which doesn't make sense to me.  Can anyone clarify this for me?",1628196124,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oyrc6j/trying_to_understand_personal_rate_of_return_with/

They're selling their owned properties and doing management/franchise agreements instead. They get % of revenue from management/franchised hotels, and some incentive fees. I'm wondering whether I should attempt to take the ADR information for brands, number of rooms, and build revenue generated by the brands, then apply the % of revenue for management/franchise (the third party who actually owns the hotel gets majority of the revenue).

Basically, they alter the DNA of yeast so that when they feed it sugar it creates whatever molecule they want, not just yummy bread.  THE John Doerr owns 19.99% and basically saved this company as they transitioned into their current business model. Graham Tanaka is another large investor, initiated a position a couple of years ago and has put out some brilliant articles/videos about its potential. He's drawn parallels to Tesla (he was one of first investors) and referring to synthetic biology as ""the next industrial revolution"". 

Amyris just posted their Q2 results (https://investors.amyris.com/2021-08-05-Amyris,-Inc-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results).
With the shenanigans happening at ZY, this quarter and future outlook solidify why AMRS is the leader in the industry and has at least a 5yr competitive advantage compared to its peers. Being able to scale your molecules is key. AMRS has a proven track record of scaling but now has shown ability to create a B2C channel for surplus inventory while realizing 100x profit margin improvement by creating private brands and going directly to consumer. Some of these brands are the fastest growing in their category (Pippette, Biossance) with 5 new brands ready to launch this quarter (Terasana launches tomorrow, Aug 6). 

Expected $2 BILLION in sales revenue by 2025 announced today. That's just from this current portfolio. Any revenue generated from new molecules (~6 new ones / yr) is bonus! Current market cap roughly $4.2b.

Production is their biggest bottleneck. Update provided today that their new facility in Brazil is on track for completion this year and should be producing in Q1 2022. ANOTHER new facility will start construction once this one's completed. Impressive to be able to strengthen the financials while growing like this.Total debt at the end of the quarter was $105 million, compared to $176 million at the end of Q2 2020. Expected to be below $100 million end of year, $50m of which converible to equity.

On top of all of this, Amyris is doing good for the planet. They published their own ESG report you can download from their website, they are Bonsucro certified, and a sponsor of the Sustainable Innovation Forum (SIF).

In a nutshell, $MX is a stock with a current outstanding buyout offer at $29.  It is trading at $21 because the government is looking into it.  You are betting on the merger going through.  If it passes the gov's scrutiny, I see us popping to at least $26, maybe up to $29.  **Let me know if you see a downside I'm not seeing.**

# Company Overview

So what is Magnachip. Magnachip, $MX, is a semi-conductor company based in South Korea that produces OLED display drivers as well as power management integrated circuits. Their OLED tech goes into smartphones, TVs, as well as automobiles. Their power integrated circuits are used in automotive, 5g, and the energy industry. The company pulled in about 500M in revenue last year and has been around for 15 years and owns a portfolio of approximately 1,200 registered patents and pending applications. So it's not a non-sense vapor-ware company. [https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12216/html](https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12216/html)

# Why Magnachip

Magnachip is supposedly such a good investment that two firms have offered to buyout Magnachip one at $29 and one at $35.

* Wiseroad Capital offered to buy the firm at at $29: [https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12246/html](https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12246/html)
* Cornucopia Investment Partners offers to buy the firm at $35: [https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12406/html](https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12406/html)

**Note that Magnachip is trading at $21 right now. 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮**

The reason why $MX is trading at $21 right now as opposed to $29 is because the US government (as well as South Korean government) has stepped in to 'review' this buyout. They don't want to lose another semiconductor company to China. Wiseroad Capital is a Chinese private equity firm. And China = Very Bad. So buying $MX means you take on the risk that the deal falls through cuz US gov thinks China = Bad.

**With that said, even with that risk, IMO, it makes sense to buy $MX** 🚀🚀. Here are a few reasons.

* I already mentioned that big boy professionals value this stock at $29 and $35. This isn't some random analyst saying it should be worth $X. This is an actual offer and someone is willing to drop billions on this company. With that said, even without the offers do some Googling and you can see that average price target for $MX is around $26.
* The merger announcement with Magnachip occurred at the end of March 2021 (although some say there had been whispers since January), sending $MX from about $20 to $26. **We are now basically at the same price PRIOR to the merger announcement**. And if you think the whispers occurred in Jan (I can't find any articles, then pre-merger price is $18). The press release cites $18.83. Regardless, either most people think that the merger is not going to happen, or this stock is a victim of the tech/small cap crash we've seen in the past month. But we are basically at pre-merger prices.
* $MX already accepted a deal from Wiseroad and it is just subject to review. According to SA, If the merger is terminated because, MX accepts a superior proposal, it would be required to pay $42.1 million (roughly 3 percent of the transaction value) to Wise Road. If the deal is terminated for the following, Wise Road is required to pay MX the respective termination fee: $70.2 million (5 percent) for failing to receive U.S. regulatory approval, $84.3 million (6 percent) for failure to receive South Korean regulatory approval, and $105.3 million (7.5 percent) for any other reason notwithstanding U.S. and South Korean approvals. **In OTHER WORDS, even IF, the deal falls through, $MX will get paid.**
* Also, even if this deal falls through, it's not unlikely that another investment firm will try to buy out $MX. Or, $MX just does so well in the next few years that it eventually trades at $29.

Do I think the deal will go through? Honestly, I'm just an ape so no idea. But note that most of Magnachip's sales are to Samsung as well as to companies in China. [https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12216/html](https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12216/html)

Meaning, it rarely sells to companies in the US. In other words, from a trade and technological standpoint, the US doesn't stand to lose much if China does end up owning the company. South Korea, could stand to lose out. But Wiseroad was willing to give up 84M if South Korea does not approve the deal.

**So when is the deal expected to go through**? Some say by the end of this year. But recently, the US announced that it plans to be done with it's part of the review by 9/13. [https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12486/html](https://investors.magnachip.com/node/12486/html)

As for when South Korea will be done? Who knows. I'd imagine it would be shortly after . OR, South Korea may have even been ok with it in the first place, and are just waiting for the US. Who knows.

But the deadline to keep in mind is 9/13, and obviously it could be A LOT SOONER. Personally, I'm thinking, if the buyout gets OKed, $MX goes to $26 after confirmation and then goes to $29 eventually. But, if it falls through, it may eventually be bought out for even more! Someone was willing to pay $35 at one point.

37,investing,jasomniax,"I think it's wrong the saying of "" Invest what you are willing to lose"" for stocks at least.","My opinion on this is for investing (for trading and options I don't know). For crypto I do agree that this saying is true since crypto is very volatile.

My point is that if you know what you are doing or more or less know what you are doing, it is very unlikely you will lose everything you've invested. You may lose 20% of your money invested, for instance I did when I started investing. It is also true that for each person it is different, but in my case, I had about 1400€ ($1657) and started investing with 500€ and then after a few months of that going well I put in another 500€ and 200€ into crypto. If I had only put 500€, which I am willing to lose, then I just wouldn't be making that much money and it would be much harder to make a decent amount of money.

In conclusion, I think one should invest an amount which you could afford to lose half of that amount. I just find it very hard to lose everything that you have invested in. Even if there's a crash and you hold and you pannick sell at the bottom, that's a -50% or -60% at most.

Tesla’s invitations, including the wording in its RSVP page, suggest that the company may be discussing some interesting topics for AI Day. 

Immediately noticeable in the AI Day invites is an image showing what seems to be a [**stack of computer hardware**](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-dojo-chip-images-dennis-hong/). Very little is known about this yet-to-be-announced hardware, though it was initially teased by legendary mechanical engineer Dennis Hong online. This fueled speculations that the image was likely related to Tesla’s Dojo Supercomputer, which would be used to train Autopilot software. 

A look at the RSVP page for the event shows a rather interesting description of the upcoming event. 

*“Join us in Palo Alto, CA on August 19, 2021, at 5 p.m. PDT. This invite-only event will feature a keynote by Elon, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in Model S Plaid, and more. Attendees will be among the first to see our latest developments in supercomputing and neural network training. They’ll also get an inside look at what’s next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet.*

*“If you have received an email invitation for this event, please submit the form below using the same email address to let us know you’d like to attend. Space is limited, and we will be confirming the attendee list closer to the event date. If you are chosen to attend AI Day, you will receive an email confirmation with additional event details.”*

Arguably the most noticeable portion from AI Day’s RSVP page is the sentence referencing what is “next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet.” Granted, Tesla is also using its software prowess for its energy products with products like Autobidder, but Elon Musk has also noted in the past that long term, people would likely think of Tesla as an [**AI robotics company**](https://www.thestreet.com/tesla/news/tesla-begins-sending-out-ai-day-invitations). AI Day seems to be a good venue to touch on some of these initiatives. 

Tesla’s [**AI Day**](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-ai-day-final-date-elon-musk/) is scheduled for August 19, 2021, at 5 p.m. PST. The event would be held in Palo Alto, CA. It remains to be seen as well if Tesla would be holding AI Day independently similar to Autonomy Day, or together with its Annual Shareholder Meeting like Battery Day last year.

Plus in regards to Aliabab I wouldn’t say their business is really that hard to understand, it’s Tencent that is more complex with more branches to the company. Tencent is much more of a conglomerate than Alibaba and I don’t think Warren being as smart as he is would have a hard time seeing the opportunity in Alibaba. 

I just look at it from the perspective of they’re cheap, they’re growing exponentially still, they’re liquid and big enough for Berkshire Hathaway to make big moves in. The only negative is the political risk of course, but it hasn’t always stopped Warren and Charlie, they bought BYD and that has been a tremendous investment for them. 

Also I realize Munger has a position in Alibaba in his personal company, so theoretically at least one of them seems to agree with it. I also understand that Greg Abel is probably more involved than ever in these decisions and I don’t know where he stands on things.

71,investing,MasterCookSwag,"SEC Chair Gensler remarks on Cryptocurrencies, and their potential qualification as securities","Honestly, for as crypto focused as many here can be I'm a bit surprised nobody posted this yet, perhaps because it doesn't appear to be great news for the more anti government focused members of the crypto community. 

Link: https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03

Noteworthy Excerpts: 

&gt; Let me start at the beginning. 

It was Halloween night 2008, in the middle of the financial crisis, when Satoshi Nakamoto published an eight-page paper[1] on a cypherpunk mailing list that’d been run by cryptographers since 1992.[2]

Nakamoto — we still don’t know who she, he, or they were — wrote, “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”[3]

Nakamoto had solved two riddles that had dogged these cryptographers and other technology experts for a couple of decades: first, how to move something of value on the internet without a central intermediary; and relatedly, how to prevent the “double-spending” of that valuable digital token.

Subsequently, his innovation spurred the development of crypto assets and the underlying blockchain technology.

Based upon Nakamoto’s innovation, about a dozen years later, the crypto asset class has ballooned. As of Monday, this asset class purportedly is worth about $1.6 trillion, with 77 tokens worth at least $1 billion each and 1,600 with at least a $1 million market capitalization.[4]

/

&gt;We already live in an age of digital public monies — the dollar, euro, sterling, yen, yuan. If that wasn’t obvious before the pandemic, it has become eminently clear over the last year that we increasingly transact online.

Such public fiat monies fulfill the three functions of money: a store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange.

No single crypto asset, though, broadly fulfills all the functions of money.

Primarily, crypto assets provide digital, scarce vehicles for speculative investment. Thus, in that sense, one can say they are highly speculative stores of value.

These assets haven’t been used much as a unit of account.

We also haven’t seen crypto used much as a medium of exchange. To the extent that it is used as such, it’s often to skirt our laws with respect to anti-money laundering, sanctions, and tax collection. It also can enable extortion via ransomware, as we recently saw with Colonial Pipeline.

With the advent of the internet age and the movement from physical money to digital money several decades ago, nations around the globe layered various public policy goals over our digital public money system.

/

The SEC has a three-part mission — to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets in between them. We focus on financial stability as well. But at our core, we’re about investor protection.

If you want to invest in a digital, scarce, speculative store of value, that’s fine. Good-faith actors have been speculating on the value of gold and silver for thousands of years.

Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto. Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West.

This asset class is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse in certain applications. There’s a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced, and complete information.

If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt.

First, many of these tokens are offered and sold as securities.

There’s actually a lot of clarity on that front. In the 1930s, Congress established the definition of a security, which included about 20 items, like stock, bonds, and notes. One of the items is an investment contract.

The following decade, the Supreme Court took up the definition of an investment contract. This case said an investment contract exists when “a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”[6] The Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed this Howey Test.

Further, this is but one of many ways we determine whether tokens must comply with the federal securities laws.

I think former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said it well when he testified in 2018: “To the extent that digital assets like [initial coin offerings, or ICOs] are securities — and I believe every ICO I have seen is a security — we have jurisdiction, and our federal securities laws apply.”[7]

I find myself agreeing with Chairman Clayton. You see, generally, folks buying these tokens are anticipating profits, and there’s a small group of entrepreneurs and technologists standing up and nurturing the projects. I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities, without required disclosures or market oversight.

This leaves prices open to manipulation. This leaves investors vulnerable.

Over the years, the SEC has brought dozens of actions in this area,[8] prioritizing token-related cases involving fraud or other significant harm to investors. We haven’t yet lost a case.

Moreover, there are initiatives by a number of platforms to offer crypto tokens or other products that are priced off of the value of securities and operate like derivatives.

Make no mistake: It doesn’t matter whether it’s a stock token, a stable value token backed by securities, or any other virtual product that provides synthetic exposure to underlying securities. These products are subject to the securities laws and must work within our securities regime.

I’ve urged staff to continue to protect investors in the case of unregistered sales of securities.

Next, I’d like to discuss crypto trading platforms, lending platforms, and other “decentralized finance” (DeFi) platforms.

The world of crypto finance now has platforms where people can trade tokens and other venues where people can lend tokens. I believe these platforms not only can implicate the securities laws; some platforms also can implicate the commodities laws and the banking laws.

A typical trading platform has more than 50 tokens on it. In fact, many have well in excess of 100 tokens. While each token’s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50 or 100 tokens, any given platform has zero securities.

Moreover, unlike other trading markets, where investors go through an intermediary like the New York Stock Exchange, people can trade on crypto trading platforms without a broker — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from around the globe.

Further, while many overseas platforms state they don’t allow U.S. investors, there are allegations that some unregulated foreign exchanges facilitate trading by U.S. traders who are using virtual private networks, or VPNs.[9]

The American public is buying, selling, and lending crypto on these trading, lending, and DeFi platforms, and there are significant gaps in investor protection.

Make no mistake: To the extent that there are securities on these trading platforms, under our laws they have to register with the Commission unless they meet an exemption.

Make no mistake: If a lending platform is offering securities, it also falls into SEC jurisdiction.",1628100480,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oxykjm/sec_chair_gensler_remarks_on_cryptocurrencies_and/

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/price-book](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/price-book)

And a quote from Warren Buffett explaining some key parts.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422384-berkshire-hathaway-stock-5-years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422384-berkshire-hathaway-stock-5-years)

Basically - how much a stock can return to its shareholders is revealed by the price-to-book ratio. Buffett explains just how this works but take him at his word for it.

In a nutshell, if a company earns $1 at a P/B of 1.00 then it can return $1 to its shareholders.

If the P/B is too high, then that company must enlarge buybacks (less than ideal) or dividends (worst option) to return value to its shareholders.

MSFT was well within normal limits of P/B up until this recent run. This recent run has entirely demolished its P/B.

* Historical P/B \~ 3.0
* Current P/B \~ 15+

What this means is that MSFT cannot possibly return value to its shareholders like it used to. The value now exists solely in the price it is currently at. And MSFT doesn't appear to have a way to dig out of this hole.

Its revenue per employee is declining, not increasing, and its future growth rate is flat, not increasing therefore not justifying the recent valuation.

To be honest, bravo to whoever made money on the recent MSFT run - but based on the resultant damage to its P/B ratio - I can't say that the return was justified fundamentally.

Plenty of other stocks including Buffetts and MSFT before the last 2 years returned great value to their shareholders without blowing-up their P/B.

When the P/B is high there's only one place to go...down - or sideways while bleeding off excess cash in stock buybacks or dividends.",1628099748,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oxyafz/its_probable_that_msft_cant_return_much_more/

The efficiency of EVs offsets some of this burden: [https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/what-is-mpge#:\~:text=Kilowatt%2Dhours%20is%20the%20standard,per%20gallon%20to%20be%20equivalent](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/what-is-mpge#:~:text=Kilowatt%2Dhours%20is%20the%20standard,per%20gallon%20to%20be%20equivalent).

By about 50% if we are conservative.

So we can say that the US is 8% short on energy production during a conversion from gas to EVs.

An 8% shortage would have huge cost implications on the electric utilities sector since they are not flexible in raising rates but instead are rate-limited usually by law.

There are 22,731 electric generators in the US at 10,346 faciliies: [https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=65&amp;t=2#:\~:text=How%20many%20power%20plants%20are,least%201%20megawatt%20(MW)](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=65&amp;t=2#:~:text=How%20many%20power%20plants%20are,least%201%20megawatt%20(MW)).

This means we need 1,819 more generators at 830 more facilities.

What does this cost?

[https://proest.com/construction/cost-estimates/power-plants/](https://proest.com/construction/cost-estimates/power-plants/)

It's variable depending on where the generators are built (and yes - solar is considered a generator in power terms) Solar for example cost $9,000,000,000 for 341 generators only producing 3,100 MW.

We don't need to get too far into the weeds.

A lot of power in the US comes from Natural Gas and it is $5,300,000,000 per 74 generators adding 4,755 MW.

So if we take Natural gas to be a kind of midline in cost then the US needs to add:

**$130,279,729,729** worth of power to the grid to convert from gasoline consumption to EVs.

I think this is a significant head-wind to EV growth when the power generation starts to get strained and people actually realize they need to spend money on power generation instead of building oil wells.

This will give BIG OIL some staying power (longer than some think).

And it provides opportunity for investment into electric utilities at some point before this critical understanding is realized.",1628094654,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oxwfma/ev_demand_power_grid_and_generation_has_to_grow_a/

10,investing,pizazzessteampipex4,Companies are capitalizing on the ongoing gold trend,"With the evolving gold demands, companies are definitely moving fast to get their hands on it. The gold market has brought a more diverse set of consumers and investors, which make it a picture of diversity and constant growth.

The demand for gold has been driven not only by cultural changes, but also by the income growth in some of the world’s most dynamic and rapidly growing economies. This brings me to the observation that gold seems to be on the roll, since I always encounter gold stocks trends in a lot of subreddits that I come across.

Big companies like Newmont Corporation ([NEM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NEM/)) basically have the largest gold reserve base in the industry. Their gold mines include Nevada, Colorado, Ontario, Quebec, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Australia, Ghana, Argentina, Peru, and Suriname.

They acquired GT Gold too, which only improved their portfolio significantly, since GT Gold has the Tatogga project in the highly sought after Golden Triangle District of British Columbia, Canada. They recently enhanced their portfolio with the approval of the Ahafo North Project in Ghana.

There are junior players out there that are showing promise as well. Take Collective Mining ([CNL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNL.V/)) for example, who has been working on potentially valuable gold projects. They are more than ready to capitalize on the trend with their Guayabales and San Antonio projects all found in Colombia. In fact, they recently discovered a high grade silver channel sampling at the Box Target.

The company also had another development a few weeks back, with their initial channel sampling campaign at the Donut target (“Donut”) within the Guayabales Project has returned high-grade gold and silver assay results from a shallow underground tunnel.

Seeing how gold mining companies are taking advantage of the trend in gold stocks, I think we can expect more people investing I guess.

34,investing,regenzeus,PSA: Missinformation about Chinese Stocks floating about everywhere. Do your own research!,"I have been fighting to correct the missinformation in the last week in the comments but I decided a dedicated thread could be useful for Investors.

Lets look at Alibaba as an example to explain what I mean. You can find all this information on their 20-F. This is my source.

**ADR vs HK shares**
The BABA ADR can be exchanged 1:8 for the HK stock for ALIBABA Holding. There is no substantial risk when it comes to ADR vs the HK stock. If BABA gets delisted in NYSE then you can still convert them to HK shares.

**ADR vs VIE**

Alibaba Holding directly ownes all the non Chinese parts of ALIBABA. They are also directly owning some of the chinese parts of ALIBABA. The CCP only restricts foreign investments into certain sectors. In all other sectors foreigners can and do have direct ownership rights. There are three categories of sectors. Sectors in which foreign investers can invest freely. Sectors in which foreign investors can hold no more then 50% of total equity. And sectors in which foreign investors can not hold any equity.

Only a part of Alibaba is not directly or indirectly owned by Alibaba Holdings. For this part they have the VIE contracts. These contracts say that Alibaba Holdings has control over the profits of these Companys and can replace the CEO. Although it is not clear if the contract is enforceable under chinese LAW (grey area).

https://otp.investis.com/clients/us/alibaba/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&amp;FilingId=15112567&amp;Cik=0001577552

For an overview open the link i pasted and search for ""C.   Organizational Structure""

The following parts of ALIBABA are not Part of ALIBABA Holdings and have a VIE contract instead:
-Zhejiang Taobao Network Co Ltd
-Zhejiang Tmal Network Co Ltd
-Alibaba Cloud Computing Ltd
-Youku Information Technology Co Ltd
These parts currently make less then 50% of total revenue.

70,investing,mphysics,Is precious metal swapping an effective investment strategy ?,"So I just watched a video on an interesting investing strategy called precious metal swapping where the idea is you look at long term charts of the ratios of the five precious metals (gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and rhodium) compared to each other, and buy when the ratios are historically cheap then sell when they're historically overvalued  (and then use those gains to buy another precious metal that's historically cheap). 

The video, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOPMngisOEM&amp;t=578s&amp;ab\_channel=FindingValueFinance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOPMngisOEM&amp;t=578s&amp;ab_channel=FindingValueFinance), outlines a scenario where if you had started in 2000 and traded based off the ratios for the next 20 years, you would've made a 38.6% annualized return. This figure is skewed a bit high due to him not taking premiums when buying/selling precious metals into account, but surely the return would still be much higher than the S&amp;P 500, right?

Corsair Gaming (CRSR): a company from my opinion (and the opinion of many analysts) is INCREDIBLY underrated. With gaming/streaming expecting to grow rapidly over the next few years, this company provides a lot of the equipment necessary for it. 

Coinbase (COIN): Crypto wallet with more uses than just buying and selling cryptocurrencies. I’m a big believer in Ethereum so I like the support for DEFI and Dapps.

SQ seems like a similar company but seems to me to be in an even better financial position than TSLA.

So when looking for tech sector, future sector (we can dub it?), I compare SQ to AAPL and MSFT, both have done amazingly well recently while staying in traditional norms of P/E and PEG ratios and are more quantifiable.

So what about SQ? Is someone who looks at these, can they walk us through why to own SQ and not just buy MSFT? Is there real downside risk? Can the carpet be pulled out like GME and AMC which are obvious garbage?

19,investing,DarthTrader357,Is Goldman Sachs a better return. MSFT/AAPL/GS,"I'm leaning toward GS because it has a few unique characteristics going for it. It's IV is good - on par with Tech, it's price is high which raises premium further, unlike AAPL and MSFT it isn't making giant runs which makes it harder to predict, and it also pays out \~2.3% dividend which acts like a keel to price fluctuation.

Right now the annualized return for 15.9% in premiums on GS is at 0% chance of being assigned. I think Probability calculators are a bit wonky though so I look at the gamma weighted strikes and most of the weight is around 375, which means for a \~16% annualized return on bi-weeklies you have a very high chance (even with the delta around 0.30) of not even getting assigned or getting assigned near a top that you can buy back in at or wait for a dip.

MSFT is \~45% probability of assignment for 11.4% annualized return.

AAPL is about the same (trading in tandem) and about 12.8% annualized return.

So I think GS has a pretty strong, relatively risk free, money piñata that largely unable to be seen unless you look at the options chains and the Greeks.

Given their dividend payouts are small - MSFT and AAPL both have to make up an approximately 6% gap in return on their share price if you take the risk of \~45% assignment to earn the annualized rate of return on premiums mentioned above. And I think that may be do-able, by share price both AAPL and MSFT are juggernauts of return.

But, then it comes down to if ones strategy should be to seek out ores of premium. And GS somehow seems to fall into a vein of gold.

A bit about the sector differences. I think Tech is waning into a mature state for the supposed bull run of the fall-to-spring season. But, given the inflationary environment, banks are tee'd well for a stronger-than-average bull run.

I've read differing opinions on why future rate hikes aren't raising the 10yr rate over the 2yr rate yet, and the argument I lean upon is the liquidity that a lot of big players are sitting on, they are still gobbling up the 2years driving their prices up relatively to 10year.

When that changes, the banks positions (less so GS but it trades tandem) will be much stronger than it appears now.",1627999758,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ox49c1/is_goldman_sachs_a_better_return_msftaaplgs/

I recently transferred an old 401k into a Roth IRA account. The amount is a little over $6k.

Ideally, I want to get into some healthy, long-term positions that I can continue to add to over time. I’m currently 32 so I’ve got a while to let things marinate. Not afraid of a little risk, as I plan to monitor and re-assess every so often.

32,investing,Sarge12312,"Alibaba misses revenue estimates as e-commerce growth slows, regulatory crackdown persists","(Reuters) -China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd missed analyst estimates for first-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as its e-commerce business was hurt by rising competition from smaller players such as JD.Com Inc and Pinduoduo Inc.

Alibaba's results mirror those of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc in the United States, as the easing of pandemic-related restrictions has led to more consumers visiting physical stores rather than ordering online.

Core commerce revenue for Alibaba rose about 35% to 180.24 billion yuan in the quarter, compared with estimates of 184.23 billion yuan. In the fourth quarter, the unit's revenue was up more than 70%.

Overall, revenue rose about 34% to 205.74 billion yuan ($31.83 billion) in the first quarter ended June 30, below estimates for 209.39 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net income attributable to shareholders rose to 45.14 billion yuan, compared with 47.59 billion yuan a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned 16.60 yuan per share, above estimates for 14.43 yuan.

Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba Group, recorded a profit of about 13.48 billion yuan in the quarter ended March, according to the Chinese e-commerce giant's filing.

Alibaba, which holds about a third of Ant, posted a profit of 4.49 billion yuan for the quarter ended June 30 from its investments in the financial conglomerate.

Revenue in Alibaba's cloud computing division grew 29% year-on-year, reaching 16.05 billion yuan ($2.49 billion)

The results come amid an ongoing Chinese regulatory crackdown on industry, during which Alibaba has become one of the main targets.

Late last year, regulators halted a planned $37 billion IPO of Ant Group in Shanghai and subsequently called for a restructuring of the financial unit.

Later, in April, China's anti-monopoly regulator fined Alibaba $2.75 billion for engaging in anti-competitive practices.

During an earnings call with investors, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said the company would continue to monitor the impact of ongoing regulatory changes on the company's business.

He cited a recent regulatory crackdown on community marketplace platforms letting sellers offer items below market price as one example of a sector the company is monitoring.

""We are in the process of studying the regulatory requirements, evaluating the potential impacts on our relevant businesses and we will respond positively with actions,"" Zhang said.

SHANGHAI, Aug 3 (Reuters) - China's regulatory agency is launching an investigation into chip distributors in the auto industry, citing suspicions of price gouging, it said on Tuesday.

The action by the State Administration For Market Regulation (SAMR) is the latest in a regulatory crackdown following a range of companies and industries targeted over the past year as the Chinese government clamps down on industry.

""In response to prominent problems such as speculation and high prices in the automotive chip market, the State Administration of Market Supervision has recently filed an investigation on car chip distributors,"" the agency said.

The firms were suspected of driving up prices, based on price monitoring and reporting clues, it added in its statement, and vowed to investigate and punish illegal acts such as hoarding, price-gouging and collusion.

A global shortage of chips that began last December has disrupted supply chains and the hardware sector worldwide. Though initially concentrated in the automotive sector, it has since spread to affect a wide range of gadgets.

Panic about supply uncertainty has occasionally led chip buyers and distributors to purchase more chips than they need, creating a vicious cycle that further drives up prices.

In June, the chief executive of chipmaker Intel said he expected the shortage to hit bottom by year-end, with the market retuning to normalcy only by 2023.

In April China's regulator imposed a record fine of $2.75 billion on e-commerce giant Alibaba for engaging in anti-competitive practices.

&gt;Bank of America Corp. BAC, -1.04% filed a shelf registration Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow it to issue up to $123 billion in debt securities, warrants, preferred stock and equity securities over time. Proceeds of any offerings will be used for working capital, to fund investments in or credit to subsidiaries, to repay debt, to invest in other businesses and for general corporate purposes. Shares were down 0.2% but have gained 26% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX, -0.18% has gained 17%.

Is this normal? $123 billion seems like a lot of money, especially for a fairly conservative bank like Bank of America. Some factoids for context:

* Bank of America is [hiring a team to explore crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/bank-of-america-creates-team-dedicated-to-researching-crypto), but it seems to be at very preliminary stages.

Tencent Holdings Ltd. dived as much as 10% Tuesday after an offshoot of China’s official news agency decried the “spiritual opium” and “electronic drugs” of games, stoking fears Beijing will next set its sights on online entertainment.

The social media giant joined rivals NetEase Inc. and XD Inc. in an abrupt selloff in early Hong Kong trading after an outlet run by the Xinhua News Agency published a blistering critique of the gaming industry. The Economic Information Daily cited a student as saying some schoolmates played Tencent’s Honor of Kings -- one of its most popular titles -- eight hours a day and called for stricter controls over time spent on games.

It spooked investors already on edge after Beijing came down hard on online industries from e-commerce to ride-hailing, triggering a global selloff of Chinese shares that at one point surpassed $1 trillion. Nervous investors continue to reevaluate their holdings as they ponder the longer-term ramifications of a crackdown on firms from Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent-backed Meituan and Didi Global Inc.

“No industry or sport should prosper by eradicating an entire generation,” the Xinhua article said, citing an academic at a state-backed institution.

Square Inc., the digital-payments platform led by Twitter Inc. founder Jack Dorsey, agreed to buy Australian buy-now, pay-later company Afterpay Ltd. for US$29 billion in its largest-ever acquisition.

The all-stock offer values Afterpay shares at AUS$126.21 each, 31 per cent higher than Friday’s closing price of AUS$96.66, the companies said in a statement. Still, that’s less than Afterpay’s February high of AUS$158.47. The stock jumped as much as 29 per cent to AUS$125 in Sydney trading Monday.

Square said the buy-now, pay-later concept represents a chance to capitalize on a shift away from traditional credit, especially among younger consumers. The plan is for Square to integrate Afterpay into both its consumer Cash App, and its Seller product for small businesses, Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja said in an interview.

“It’s very different from the traditional consumer-financing business model,” Ahuja said, describing “buy now, pay later” as an “alternative” to traditional credit. “Since our founding days we have seen it as a key priority for our customers, whether merchants or consumers, to get fast access to funds,” she added, but declined to say whether Square would offer other traditional finance options, like a credit card.

Square shares were up about 3% in the first minutes of trading Monday in New York.

Afterpay lets consumers purchase items on credit and pay later with a series of installments. It’s particularly popular with younger consumers -- who may not have a credit card -- to buy clothes, beauty products and homewares. There are no fees or interest on the loan as long as people pay on time, according to Afterpay’s website.

The deal should also help boost Cash App’s total user base by adding Afterpay’s 16 million users to Cash App’s existing user base of 70 million annual users, Ahuja said.

Larger competitors have pushed into the market recently, adding to the challenges for Afterpay and its peers. Apple Inc. is teaming up with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on a buy now, pay later service that would be tied with Apple Pay, Bloomberg News reported in July. Afterpay shares fell 10 per cent the day following the report.

Afterpay shareholders may reject the proposed Square offer, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Matt Ingram and Regan Burrows wrote. They pointed out the offer is below the stock’s peak earlier this year and its growth is much faster than the U.S. company.

Under the proposed agreement, Afterpay co-founders and co-CEOs Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar would join Square and help lead Afterpay’s merchant and consumer businesses as part of Square’s Seller and Cash App division.

The acquisition would be easily the biggest deal for an Australian company, eclipsing the US$16.6 billion a group of pension funds last month bid for Sydney Airport, only to have the offer rejected as too low.
Square recently launched its banking operations, including checking and savings accounts for small businesses, and offers loans. The addition of Afterpay also gives the digital payments company a chance to expand into consumer lending, which it doesn’t currently offer.

‘Shared Purpose’

“Square and Afterpay have a shared purpose,” Dorsey said in the statement. “We built our business to make the financial system more fair, accessible, and inclusive, and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles.”

Square also reported second-quarter gross profit of US$1.14 billion, up 91 per cent year-over-year. Gross payment volume, or the total amount of payments processed on Square’s platform, increased 88 per cent to US$42.8 billion, the company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected US$36.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Square had been scheduled to release earnings Thursday.

Total revenue, including Bitcoin, was US$4.68 billion. Bitcoin revenue alone was US$2.72 billion, below the US$3.4 billion estimate by analysts. Square said Bitcoin revenue declined because of “relative stability in the price of Bitcoin, which affected trading activity compared to prior quarters.”
Afterpay was founded in 2015 and now has more than 1,300 employees globally, according to Molnar.
 
The board of Melbourne-based Afterpay unanimously recommended shareholders accept the deal, which the company said is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.",1627930478,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owl62e/square_acquires_afterpay_for_29b/

Qualcomm was involved in making the chips in the oculus headset, and will likely be the ones supplying them for the upcoming one.

I'm split between which one to invest in. Sadly, even with a very successful VR launch, VR is a very minor aspect for them, and will probably not affect stock price much.

**Its affordability** , with the Company offering affordable medical coverage plans , spanning low - cost basic plans to more expensive , but cost - effective , Premier and Prestige plans that provide a greater degree of coverage .

 

Clover Health generates revenue through the provision of health insurance and healthcare services to customers under US Government’s federal Medicare Advantage program .

The Company derives revenue in two principal streams :

* Revenue derived through the payment of premiums by the government under the Medicare Advantage program ;
* Revenue derived from health coverage subscriptions .

Clover Health offers insurance plans at three different levels .

This includes a basic plan that does not incur a monthly cost , as well a more extensive plans at the Premium and Prestige level , which cost around $ 40 and $ 178 per month respectively .

&amp;#x200B;

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid ( CMS ) - introduced direct contracts as a new type of payment model .

The move to direct contracts was intended to encourage health / insurance providers to move from a pay - for - service model to a value-based model .

In other words , to focus on your health and the results of rather expensive treatments .

The goal of a direct contract CMS is to transfer more control to healthcare providers .

It is hoped that health / insurance providers will invest more in technology as incentives are aimed at improving health outcomes .

In this case , Clover Health already has an advantage over its competitors with its data - driven and AI -powered Clover Assistant software .

Clover Assistant is a key differentiator for the company .

Traditional approaches to healthcare are constrained by factors such as outdated technologies and large capital requirements .

&amp;#x200B;

After launching Clover Health's direct contracting business , the company added 65,000 new members in eight states .  
Clover Health's home - based primary care program has been designed to improve the management of medically challenging cases .

This is especially useful for debilitated or bedridden elderly people with limited mobility .

Clover Health's home - based primary care program was able to reduce hospital admissions by 17 % and medical costs by an average of $ 325 per participant per month .

Clover Health believes that it will be able to expand its direct contract business to 200,000 beneficiaries in the near future .

By the end of 2021 , the company plans to reach between 70,000 and 100,000 beneficiaries .

This should mean an additional $ 20 million to $ 30 million in revenue for the company .

For 2020 , revenue :

1 St quarter - $ 166 million .

DSCR has been on the move since the Company completed the agreement with Sierra Gold LLC. to acquire the Ruby Mining claims and commence mining operations. The Ruby is one of California’s best-known buried placer mines and is considered by many to be one of the largest producing river channel mines of modern times. It features a system of gold-bearing Tertiary channels which have been reported to have already produced over 250,000 ounces of gold. The Ruby is also renowned for its production of course and jewelers-grade gold, with the largest gold nugget weighing 201 ounces or 17 pounds. It is conservatively estimated that 134,844 ounces of gold are available for near-term recovery from identified channels using the existing Ruby infrastructure. Placer refers to mining the buried watercourse riverbed at Ruby. There are 3.5 miles of river channels yet to be mined on the Ruby mining claims. Historically the channels have produced up to 106,000 oz per mile, indicating a potential of 370,000 oz of gold still to be mined from the buried placer. (310,000 oz Gold is worth $646 million dollars at current gold prices.”

The hopes for recovery from the pandemic fell flat with the resurgence of the new Delta variant. As the new Covid-19 cases rise across the globe, market investors and economists fear sloppy economic growth.   

First identified in India, Delta is now dominant in the U.K. and several other countries, including Germany, Italy, and France. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the variant is detected in 96 countries. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has classified it as a variant ‘of concern’ and said delta accounts for 20% of all covid cases in the U.S.  

There has been uncertainty and doubts over the economic recuperation ever since the delta made its way.

A week ago, IHS Markit survey of American businesses reported that the new variant played a part in weighing on June factory output, particularly “in various emerging Asian economies.” 

Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, says, “The Delta variant poses a major risk to the outlook. Not only have rising case numbers led to a slide in business optimism to the lowest since February, but further Covid waves around the world could also lead to further global supply-chain delays.” 

U.S. Economists were earlier predicting that the Gross Domestic Product GDP) would increase at an annualized rate of around 10% in the second quarter, followed by continued strong growth through the rest of the year and 2022.

	How did Intel's co-founder predict the semiconductor chip shortage of 2020-21? Intel has been making some big moves these past few months. CEO Patrick Gelsinger is doing everything from building infrastructure and acquiring companies to signing contracts and securing partnerships. Intel is on track to stay ahead of the competition.  

**Moore's Law**

Moore's Law states three things:

* The number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years
* Research and development increase the speed and capability of technology
* The growth of microprocessors is exponential.

**Conclusion**

	 CEO Patrick Gelsinger has been making some big moves these past couple of months. Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. 

	Intel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.

	Moore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.

	The U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.

	The global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.

Do they hoard on gold first? Buy real estate? Buy competing businesses? Increase their debt as leverage?

I watched a few videos on this subject, seems to be all over the place. Not looking for a secret formula, but maybe an explanation of what you think and why.

I read about debt. Some of the “winners” bought a bunch of properties to amass as much debt as they could, so that when a recession would hit, they’d end-up paying so much less. But then my question is, if before a crash properties are super inflated at the start, does that mean they purchase huge amount of over valued properties on debt hoping for it to crash?

**Abstract**

* The purpose of this report is to review the evidence on the profitability of technical analysis. To achieve this purpose, the report comprehensively reviews survey, theoretical and empirical studies regarding technical trading strategies.
* The survey literature indicates that technical analysis has been widely used by market participants in futures markets and foreign exchange markets, and that about 30% to 40% of practitioners appear to believe that technical analysis is an important factor in determining price movement at shorter time horizons up to 6 months.
* We provide an overview of theoretical models that include implications about the profitability of technical analysis. Conventional efficient market theories, such as the martingale model and random walk models, rule out the possibility of technical trading profits in speculative markets, while relatively recent models such as noisy rational expectation models or behavioral models suggest that technical trading strategies may be profitable due to noise in the market or investors’ irrational behavior
* Early studies indicated that technical trading strategies were profitable in foreign exchange markets and futures markets, but not in stock markets before the 1980s. Modern studies indicated that technical trading strategies consistently generated economic profits in a variety of speculative markets at least until the early 1990s. Among a total of 92 modern studies, 58 studies found positive results regarding technical trading strategies, while 24 studies obtained negative results. Ten studies indicated mixed results.
* Despite the positive evidence on the profitability of technical trading strategies, it appears that most empirical studies are subject to various problems in their testing procedures.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

Technical analysis is a forecasting method of price movements using past prices, volume, and open interest.2 Pring (2002), a leading technical analyst, provides a more specific definition:

&gt;“The technical approach to investment is essentially a reflection of the idea that prices move in trends that are determined by the changing attitudes of investors toward a variety of economic, monetary, political, and psychological forces. The art of technical analysis, for it is an art, is to identify a trend reversal at a relatively early stage and ride on that trend until the weight of the evidence shows or proves that the trend has reversed.”

&amp;#x200B;

* Technical analysis includes a variety of forecasting techniques ... However, academic research on technical analysis is generally limited to techniques that can be expressed in mathematical forms, namely technical trading systems, although some recent studies attempt to test.
* Since Charles H. Dow first introduced the Dow theory in the late 1800s, technical analysis has been extensively used among market participants such as brokers, dealers, fund managers, speculators, and individual investors in the financial industry. 3 Numerous surveys indicate that practitioners attribute a significant role to technical analysis.
* For example, futures fund managers rely heavily on computer-guided technical trading systems (Irwin and Brorsen 1985; Brorsen and Irwin 1987; Billingsley and Chance 1996), and about 30% to 40% of foreign exchange traders around the world believe that technical analysis is the major factor determining exchange rates in the short-run up to six months (e.g., Menkhoff 1997; Cheung and Wong 2000; Cheung, Chinn, and Marsh 2000; Cheung and Chinn 2001).
* In contrast to the views of many practitioners, most academics are skeptical about technical analysis. Rather, they tend to believe that markets are informationally efficient and hence all available information is impounded in current prices (Fama 1970). In efficient markets, therefore, any attempts to make profits by exploiting currently available information are futile.
* Nevertheless, in recent decades rigorous theoretical explanations for the widespread use of technical analysis have been developed based on noisy rational expectation models (Treynor and Ferguson 1985; Brown and Jennings 1989; Grundy and McNichols 1989; Blume, Easley, and O’Hara 1994), behavioral (or feedback) models (De Long et al. 1990a, 1991; Shleifer and Summers 1990), disequilibrium models (Beja and Goldman 1980), herding models (Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein 1992), agent-based models (Schmidt 2002), and chaos theory (Clyde and Osler 1997). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Survey Studies**

&amp;#x200B;

* The oldest survey study regarding technical analysis dates back to Stewart (1949), who analyzed the trading behavior of customers of a large Chicago futures commission firm over the 1924-1932 period. The result indicated that in general traders were unsuccessful in their grain futures trading, regardless of their scale and knowledge of the commodity traded
* Amateur speculators were more likely to be long than short in futures markets.
* Smidt (1965a) surveyed trading activities of amateur traders in the US commodity futures markets in 1961.4 In this survey, about 53% of respondents claimed that they used charts either exclusively or moderately in order to identify trends.
* There was a slight tendency for chartists to pyramid more frequently than other traders.5 It is interesting to note that only 10% of the chartists, compared to 29% of the non-chartists, nearly always took long positions.
* The Group of Thirty (1985) surveyed the views of market participants on the functioning of the foreign exchange market in 1985. The respondents were composed of 40 large banks and 15 securities houses in 12 countries.
* 97% of bank respondents and 87% of the securities houses believed that the use of technical analysis had a significant impact on the market.
* Brorsen and Irwin (1987) carried out a survey of large public futures funds’ advisory groups in 1986. In their survey, more than half of the advisors responded that they relied heavily on computer-guided technical trading systems.
* Since technically traded public and private futures funds were estimated to control an average of 23% of the open interest in ten important futures markets, the funds seemed large enough to move prices if they traded in unison ( &lt;&lt; Interesting point)
* Frankel and Froot (1990) showed that switching a forecasting method for another over time may explain changes in the demand for dollars in foreign exchange markets. The evidence provided was the survey results of Euromoney magazine for foreign exchange forecasting firms.
* In 1978, nineteen forecasting firms exclusively used fundamental analysis and only three firms technical analysis. After 1983, however, the distribution had been reversed. In 1983, only one firm reported using fundamental analysis, and eight technical analysis. In 1988, seven firms appeared to rely on fundamental analysis while eighteen firms employed technical analysis.
* Cheung, Chinn, and Marsh (2000) surveyed the views of UK-based foreign exchange dealers on technical anaysis in 1998. In this survey, 33% of the respondents described themselves as technical analysts
* Moreover, 26% of the dealers responded that technical trading is the most important factor that determines exchange rate movements over the medium run.
* Cheung and Chinn (2001) published survey results for US-based foreign exchange traders conducted in 1998. In the survey, about 30% of the traders indicated that technical trading best describes their trading strategy
* About 31% of the traders responded that technical trading was the primary factor determining exchange rate movements up to 6 months.

(Quite a lot more in this survey section but will leave it at that to keep this somewhat brief)

* In sum, survey studies indicate that technical analysis has been widely used by practitioners in futures markets and foreign exchange markets, and regarded as an important factor in determining price movements at shorter time horizons. However, no survey evidence for stock market traders was found.

&amp;#x200B;

**Theory**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Efficient Markets Hypothesis**

&amp;#x200B;

The efficient markets hypothesis has long been a dominant paradigm in describing the behavior of prices in speculative markets. Working (1949, p. 160) provided an early version of the hypothesis:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If it is possible under any given combination of circumstances to predict future price changes and have the predictions fulfilled, it follows that the market expectations must have been defective ; ideal market expectations would have taken full account of the information which permitted successful prediction of the price changes.

&amp;#x200B;

* Revised his definition of a perfect futures market to “… one in which the market price would constitute at all times the best estimate that could be made, from currently available information, of what the price would be at the delivery date of the futures contracts (Working, 1962, p. 446).”
* Identical to the famous definition of an efficient market given by Fama (1970, p. 383): “A market in which prices always ‘fully reflect’ available information is called ‘efficient’.”
* Thus, technical analysis provides a weak form test of market efficiency because it heavily uses past price history

(I'm going to skip some section now but the full table of content is at the bottom of the post)

&amp;#x200B;

**Chart Pattern Studies**

&amp;#x200B;

* Chang and Osler evaluated the performance of the head-and-shoulders pattern using daily spot rates for 6 currencies (mark, yen, pound, franc, Swiss franc, and Canadian dollar) during the entire floating rate period, 1973-1994.
* head-and-shoulders rule s generated statistically significant returns of about 13% and 19% per year for the mark and yen, respectively, but not for the other exchange rates.
* Returns from the exogenous exit rule appeared to be insignificant in most cases. The trading profits from the endogenous exit rules were substantially higher than either the annual buy-and-hold returns of 2.5% for the mark and 4.4% for the yen or annual average stock yield of 6.8% measured on the S&amp;P 500 index.
* Chang and Osler further investigated the performance of moving average rules and momentum rules and compared the results with the observed performance of the head-and shoulders rule. Returns from the simple technical trading systems appeared statistically significant for all six currencies and the simpler rules easily outperformed the head-and shoulders rules
* Hence, Chang and Osler concluded that, although the head-and-shoulders patterns had some predictive power for the mark and yen during the period of floating exchange rates, the use of the head-and-shoulders rule did not seem to be rational, because they were easily dominated by simple moving average rules and momentum rules (&lt;&lt; This is actually a really good point. The way a trend forms means the head and shoulders pattern produces one of the most common false signals and usually a strong counter move when breaking, but the ones that work are important).
* Caginalp and Laurent (1998) reported that candlestick reversal patterns generated substantial profits in comparison to an average gain for the same holding period. For the S&amp;P 500 stocks over the 1992-1996 period
* In general, the results of chart pattern studies varied depending on patterns, markets, and sample periods tested, but suggested that some chart patterns might have been profitable in stock markets and foreign exchange markets

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary and Conclusion**

* Most survey studies indicate that technical analysis has been widely used by market participants in futures markets and foreign exchange markets, and that at least 30% to 50 40% of practitioners regard technical analysis as an important factor in determining price movement at shorter time horizons up to 6 months.
* In the theoretical literature, the conventional efficient markets models, such as the martingale and random walk models, rule out the existence of profitable technical trading (&lt;&lt; All the efficient market stuff is just a theory. It's so often stated as if it is fact)... On the other hand, several other models, such as noisy rational expectations models, feedback models, disequilibrium models, herding models, agent-based models, and chaos theory, suggest that technical trading strategies may be profitable
* In these models, thus, there exist profitable trading opportunities that are not being exploited.

22,investing,theepicone111,Balancing out your portfolio feels so good!,"I’ll admit, I fell into the trap of investing in speculative companies at the start of this year (when I started investing). At one point I was 40% in speculative companies and they started dropping like rocks. Over the last few months I’ve been buying more well established companies, diversifying into different sectors and man it feels great to see the % of my speculative investments drop. Still got a way to go but great for my peace of mind. Still looking for some more sectors in my portfolio but at the moment everything seems a little overpriced so going to keep averaging into an index and oversold companies until we get a decent pullback.

I would like to keep 10% in bonds or cash to take advantage of rebalancing. 

But I'm not sure how I feel about bonds right now. If you are buying bonds now, isn't that kind of like betting interest rates will go negative? I know bonds tend to go down in value when interest rates go up. And it seems a common theme now is investors shorting bonds, which is a little scary to be honest. 

The Cash fund offered in my plan is "" Invesco Stable Val Trust CF"", which basically tracks the ""[FTSE 3 Month US T-Bill Index Series""](https://www.ftserussell.com/products/indices/3m-us-tbill). It has a 0.35% expense ratio, which is kind of high for a cash fund imo.

41,investing,doggy_lovers,Adobe vs Netflix compared (and faang debate),"I picked these to compare since they both run a subscription based model and have similar marketcaps (250 billion or so), and pe (54 or so) As of right now im leaning towards adobe, the reason is because they have few competitors, diverse products range. I believe they have better growth potential thanks to better pricing power and more user growth potential. (us&amp;international growth vs netflix primarily international) higher margins (40% vs 16%), stock buybacks (-1% vs +1% dilution), high switching costs better moat, much better balance sheet for adobe.

On a forward pe, adobe is about 10% more expensive (fwd pe of 44 vs 40) and marketcap wise it is about 25% higher. (adobe makes about 15% more profit) The main benefit for netflix is improving margins over time but I only see net profit margins going to 25% max.

One thing I want to add for adobe has over 100 products with 60% being creative cloud and that alone has 20-30 famous products like photoshop, primer pro, the stuff you know adobe for. document cloud and digital experience no one knows but that segment is growing like crazy whereas netflix makes 99% of revenue from one main product. the two segments for adobe is mostly business to business like digital marketing, digital signatures, data analytics, ai, ecommerce sales, publishing, and much more and makes 40% of sales and growing in a fast market where things are going more digital (think youtube, shopify, docusign). I just dont see much growth for netflix where pretty much in the us more than 70 million users out of 120 million households have it already.

But i put up an poll on whats better earlier elsewhere and everyone said netflix, but no one really explained why? is adobe underrated and should it replace netflix in faang, or is netflix still king and explain why it is better because i dont get the hype and why everyone still use faang for big tech synonym when they are several other growth tech companies like adobe that have much higher marketcap than netflix. anyways, what is your pick on whats the better company",1627709881,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ov1ml8/adobe_vs_netflix_compared_and_faang_debate/

(Before we start, This is how I did all this 100% Free: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr\_OhOs8Xu8&amp;t=10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr_OhOs8Xu8&amp;t=10s) 

**The** first manner human beings are creating wealth from Tik Tok is developing bills after which promoting them. This is turning into an increasing number of famous with-inside the eCommerce or product area. Example of Tiktok Live on diverse Tiktok bills. Similar to Instagram, you’re going to pick a gap after which pass in advance and create wonderful content material, preferably content material that is going viral to draw that individual who might be the appropriate client on your product. There are already human beings on this area nowadays who're developing TikTok profiles round a sure hobby.

Usually it’s a gap subject matter and that they may not have whatever to promote, however they’re going to attain out to manufacturers in that enterprise and promote their TikTok profile to them and those are authentic creating wealth this manner. The right information for product manufacturers is after they have that account of their hands, it’s without a doubt pretty clean to promote merchandise. One manner that human beings are promoting merchandise is thru TikTok Live. They are launching merchandise whilst livestreaming or they’re without a doubt keeping auctions whilst stay streaming. And, of course, there may be the hyperlink withinside the bio wherein you may constantly power your fans to buy your product. So in case you’re the kind of individual to like TikTok, and also you simply need to develop a following round a sure subject matter and construct that network round a sure subject matter, pass for it after which attain out to the ones manufacturers who would really like to have get admission to to the ones fans and promote them your account.

**#2: Donations** The 2nd manner human beings are creating wealth from TikTok goes Live and gathering donations from viewers (similar to you may do on different platforms, like Twitch). I discover this selection of TikTok fascinating. It’s truly a constructed in monetization platform, actually from day one. From what I’ve visible, here’s the way it works: When you’re a TikTok user, you may pass into your profile and buy some thing referred to as cash. For one hundred cash it'll price you $1.39. Now what do you do with those cash? When one in every of your preferred creators goes Live, you may without a doubt ship them cash as a manner of giving thank you for all in their attempt in growing the content material they do. What does the author do with this coin? The author turns the cash into diamonds and people diamonds may be transformed into coins through PayPal. Cool, proper? On the Chinese model of TikTok – an app referred to as Douyin – there may be a next-stage function much like this. When creators are Live, they could without a doubt connect a buying cart to a product they promote. So it’s kinda like QVC or the buying channel. You can pass Live, keep an auction, and those can purchase your product whilst you’re Live thru the buying cart function. My bet is this selection goes to return back to bills international faster in preference to later.

**#3: Manage** influencer campaigns The 1/3 manner to make cash from TikTok is to control influencer campaigns. This isn’t a brand new idea. There are directly up influencer organizations to serve Instagram influencers already. The identical idea applies to TikTok. You may be the intermediary or the broking among a author on TikTok and a logo who desires to paintings with that influencer. From growing the settlement, coping with each parties, ensuring the deliverables are all met – simply being a coordinator – you may fee a carrier rate to control campaigns like that. TikTok as a platform is smart; they without a doubt have an inner influencer software already constructed in. So if I’m a massive logo and I need to attain out to TikTok and say, Hey, that is the distance I’m in, what influencers ought to I paintings with? I can do that. The best component is, I’m going to pay a percent to TikTok for brokering that settlement. That’s wherein you may are available in as a carrier or business enterprise to make that settlement outdoor of TikTok and assist manufacturers shop a bit little bit of cash

**#4: Tiktok** advertisements platform The fourth manner you may make cash from TikTok is through the use of their advertisements platform. Just like Facebook and Instagram advertisements, you may Google proper now, “TikTok advertisements” and join up for get admission to to their advertisements platform. It is quite self-explanatory in case you’ve ever run paid site visitors before, so in case your market’s on TikTok, it is probably really well worth you growing some advertisements, placing a few price range closer to experimenting there and seeing what occurs. Maybe you may promote greater of your merchandise thru TikTok!

**#5: Management offerings** The 5th manner you may make cash from TikTok is through presenting control offerings for creators at the app. Some creators on TikTok have hundreds of thousands of fans and occasionally this occurs truly rapid and in a single day for that author. It’s like having a enterprise land of their lap. Tiktok profile of Charli D'Amelio with 14.4M fans. You should step in and provide offerings to assist them with their content material method, their innovative method, perhaps coping with gives and offers that come their manner. So when you have that history in manufacturing or storytelling, you may simply observe that to presenting control offerings to [TikTok creators.](https://tiktokbusiness7.blogspot.com/)

**#6: Consulting** Last however now no longer least, when you turn out to be a seasoned on TikTok, and perhaps you truly apprehend how a person should take a video that perhaps receives one hundred perspectives and assist them get 100,000 perspectives, well, you may really provide consulting offerings. This is a truly high-quality manner to leverage your understanding from the platform and assist folks who need to be TikTok well-known or they need to be creators, without a doubt increase their method so their films get visible through loads of thousands, if now no longer hundreds of thousands of human beings.

Of course, you want to have the history and the enjoy on this first to provide this as a carrier. But when you’re there, human beings can pay to have your enjoy and your mind on their account. And in case you assist them get any offers or influencer agreements, you may even negotiate a percent or a reduce of that deal really due to the fact you're their representative and you've helped them pass viral on TikTok. So there you've got got it. Six approaches that I see human beings creating wealth from[ TikTok nowadays, even whilst it’s ](https://tiktokbusiness7.blogspot.com/)nevertheless truly, truly early on. Let’s pass returned to my first factor at the start of this video. Why do I, an Instagram marketer, suppose that TikTok is probably greater effective than Instagram? The manner I see it, Instagram testimonies are type of much like TikTok films, however they expire after 24 hours. This is wherein TikTok is effective. TikTok is without a doubt much like YouTube, which means you may submit a video nowadays, however perhaps the set of rules alternatives it up months later and begins offevolved pushing that video into the feed of folks who would really like it.

The reality that your films don’t disappear has a variety of electricity to it due to the fact it could power a variety of site visitors and eyeballs to you months after the reality. That motive on my own is why human beings have become occasionally hundreds of thousands of perspectives to their TikTok films with only a few fans. It’s due to the fact the set of rules is selecting up your video, and pushing it out. Again, there’s a variety of hobby and now no longer a variety of content material. So the set of rules is pushing it out to the folks who it thinks are going to be receptive to that content material. And – hello – waking as much as hundreds of thousands of perspectives with only a few fans. I mean, in nowadays’s day and age, I don’t suppose there’s some other app or platform that could provide you with the ones types of[ outcomes proper now.](https://tiktokbusiness7.blogspot.com/)",1627691066,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oux8vj/how_to_make_money_with_tiktok_sorry_for_long_post/

82,investing,CaezarVII,Is valuation relative or absolute?,"Something I've been struggling with over the past 5 years or so is whether my perception of valuations should be strictly relative, or at least to a degree, absolute. As Howard Marks says in [this video](https://youtu.be/Dal2ecPcE0g), no asset class valuation is explicitly irrational right now relative to interest rates and other assets, and so in that sense we are not in a traditional bubble. That said, I feel like some assets may be in a bubble not because of their relative valuation, but rather because of the safety that investors generally associate with them and the potential downside risk.

For example, treasuries are meant to be a ""safe haven"", but if you consider the damage that a 1% increase to long-term rates could do to 20 or 30yr treasuries, they are actually not a safe haven at all with regard to preservation of capital in the medium term. As another example, forward P/E typically tops out around 16x or maybe 18x on the very very high end of norms. Analyst estimates have SP 500 2022 earnings at about 215 which means that if the forward P/E ratio returns back to somewhere the very very high end of near normal by year end, the SP 500 would be at 3870 which is a 12% correction from where we are. When weighing whether we'll still be at either 18x or 22x forward P/E, or whether earnings will somehow beat estimates by a lot, it still seems like there is outsized downside risk in buying the SP 500 at 4400 in July 2021. It just doesn't seem rational.

TLDR; even though valuations are relatively fair, are they too high relative to the downside risk? Owning treasuries and even stocks seems to be like picking up pennies in front of a steam roller.",1627671199,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ouqqgu/is_valuation_relative_or_absolute/

94,investing,chemicalbilly,Wash sale tax question specific to ETrade,"I've hit the limits on google, so would like to hear others opinions. I stumbled across this article recently: [Strategies to Help Clients Around the Wash Sale Rule | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/strategies-help-clients-around-wash-sale-rule-2015-11-10)

TL;DR: within the article is an interesting strategy to capture a loss on common without triggering a wash sale. 1) Sell your stock at a loss 2) buy a long call (triggers wash sale, inherits the basis) 3) Buy back the stock (has its own basis).

I called up ETrade to confirm they would assign the cost basis to the call, however several ETrade customer service reps told me that ETrade does not consider long or short calls to trigger the wash sale (even if the call is ITM). This seems at odds with various interpretations of the murky IRS guidelines on wash sales. At the end of the day, I will report whatever is in my 1099, but this seems wrong given a call (even OTM) is often considered ""substantially identical.""

According to ETrade, I should be able to do the following: 1) sell stock at a loss 2) buy a 30 day OTM call to capture any potential upside (no wash sale adjustment) 3) wait 31 days from step 1 and then buy back the stock (avoiding wash sale).

Anyone have direct experience with either approach above and received 1099s from ETrade that can clear this up for me? Would it be safer to do a different strategy (also outlined in the article): 1) sell the stock 2) sell a 31-day ITM put to lock in a purchase price?",1627666207,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oup5hv/wash_sale_tax_question_specific_to_etrade/

Hello all, just want to help the community at large out with spreading some knowledge on a innovative new investment product, smart indices on BSC brought to you by Bundle Dao.

The indices currently available to mint or to purchase from the free market are bDeFi (a collection of blue-chip DeFi tokens), bChain (a hyper-focused index containing native assets of market-leading chains and high-cap protocols), and my personal favorite bStable (a collection of your major stable coins). Think of these as basically being able to own and track specific segments of the crypto market in one token. One coin for a piece of the whole pie. What makes these indices unique in the world of crypto is the ability for dynamic re balancing and arbitraging boosting gains inside the index. On top of this, future updates will bring strategies to the indices, meaning they will become passive income earning machines. The indexes can be easily minted from the requisite assets or purchased from the open market via PCS. These indices can then be staked on the Bundle platform to earn additional yield in the form of the protocol's native token BDL, a hard capped at 210,000,000 governance and profit sharing token, earning holders a portion of the protocol's performance fees.

In short this is the real deal. No boring ass copy pasta PCS and Goose clones, no broken algo, and the only project doing anything similar isn't doing it even nearly to this level and is basically a shit farm token. The dev on this project is a mad genius and community on Discord is about as helpful as they come. The upside on this shit is huge. DYOR. Check it out. Links and stats below.

23,investing,Adept_Chip,An Insight Into Canadian Casino Stocks," 

Six out of ten Canadians partake in monthly gambling of some form placing Canada fourth on the list of countries spending the most in the sector. At the time of writing there are 88 land-based casinos in Canada, and citizens are at liberty to gamble at a number of offshore online casinos that accept Canadian players.

The law surrounding online casinos in Canada is not as straightforward as in some other countries. Legally, casinos cannot operate if the servers are located on Canadian soil but offshore sites based in the Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus accept Canadian players.

Furthermore, the native territory of Kahnawake has their own Gaming Commission that licenses both online and land-based casinos. Spin casino is an example of a provider with licenses from both Malta and Kahnawake. The online casino is regulated by the Malta Gaming Authority, a worldwide established gaming license company.

The combination of a disposed general public and sufficient regulatory space has and will continue to have a positive effect on Canadian casino stocks. The best performing Canadian gaming/gambling stocks at present are:

* Pollard Banknote Limited (PBL)

A printing company for government lotteries in North America and the rest of the world. With a market cap of $1.38 billion CAD and a 43.82% price change increase in the year to date, PBL is a solid investment.

* Great Canadian Gaming Corporation (GC)

Operating 25 facilities across the country including casinos, hotels and theatres GC Gaming is one of the largest gaming companies in the province. Based out of British Columbia, they now possess a market cap of $2.56 billion CAD and with a recent takeover bid by Apollo Global Management Inc. given the green light there is an element of uncertainty (and potential to make profit) in the near future.

* Gamehost Inc. (GH)

A much smaller market cap of only $188 million CAD compared to GC Gaming, Gamehost is Alberta’s hospitality and gaming leader, operating slot machines, lottery terminals and table games at their facilities. Riskier than more established options in an already volatile sector, the investment has the potential to go either way.

Recently, bill C-218 passed in the Senate which will signal the legalization of single-event sport gambling. The upper chamber approved the bill in June 2021 and will become law once royal assent is approved.

The adoption of this landmark act will expand the betting and gaming industry hugely as well as generating billions in revenue for Provincial governments that regulate gambling. It will mean the money that was once spent on offshore sites will now be able to be regulated on home turf and the domestic stock market is likely to respond accordingly.

The gaming sector for the longest time has been a steady up and up investment. However, recently some dyed in the wool stalwarts have been not only underperforming but even losing value. Burgeoning companies adopting new technologies can be undervalued and while carrying a touch more risk might pay attractive dividends. Either that or pick out the well-established companies that have their sights set expanding their operations.

17,investing,DarthTrader357,Investing in Wine for the enthusiast,"Someone had previously asked about investing in wine, and the explanations didn't really reach deeper. I became particularly curious and have made it this deep so far on how an enthusiast might better invest in wine. We can start with some basic parts.

1. Obtaining investment grade wines (typically called Growths and from regions in France though I found a Lebanese wine, *Chateau Musar*, that has some great appeal.
2. Storing - [winebid.com](https://winebid.com) seems superior (was recommended to me) to [vinfolio.com](https://vinfolio.com) \- the differences being [winebid.com](https://winebid.com) has a more thorough process of inspection before auction and so is probably more likely to move better wines. Winebid requires your collection be stored with them until auction. Vinfolio apparently does not require this.
3. Selling - What investment wine and why? How do the prices move? You can determine that decently here: [https://www.wineauctionprices.com/](https://www.wineauctionprices.com/)

I'm not entirely sold on the idea of buying a wine as investment to flip it. The value-added (*already priced in*) to purchasing a wine at some investment storage facility means the only potential value of your wine investment would have to come from price appreciation at the wholesale.

Rather, the best way to invest in wine continues to seem to be the importer, the direct buyer, and the retail-seller.

For the scopes of many, I think retail is far off. It'd require some reason for someone to buy wine from you at retail prices, such as at a restaurant.

If you are to invest in wine then, I think #1 from above means you'll have to do your homework and actually buy these wines direct. And I haven't determined yet how competitive that is but rest assured there's plenty of wine consultants who already do it in order to acquire a library of bottles for distribution to their clientele such as restaurants.

But, if you can do the same and accumulate a library of bottles from the wineries themselves (they also compete by selling wholesale on these sites and online sales), then you get yourself a nice mark-up premium and you can continue to enjoy price appreciation as well.",1627575874,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ou0rt5/investing_in_wine_for_the_enthusiast/

These analysts work for firms that hold these stocks don’t they? So what would be their incentive to have a stock under perform analyst expectations? Surely they are incentivised to issue estimates that are going to be beaten and cause the earnings to seem great?

Prosecutors charged the billionaire, who resigned as chairman in September, with two counts of securities fraud, including making false statements about the company, and wire fraud.

“Milton’s scheme targeted individual, non-professional investors — so-called retail investors — by making false and misleading statements directly to the investing public through social media, and television, print and podcast interviews,” prosecutors said in the 49-page indictment. 

Milton, who was the company’s largest shareholder, was held roughly $8.5 billion in Nikola stock at the height of the company’s value.

Shares of Nikola were down by more than 9% during premarket trading to less than $13 a share.

The grand jury said Milton shall forfeit all property “traceable to the commission of said offenses,” which would likely include the more than $1 billion he earned when Nikola went public in June 2020.

Prosecutors said Milton “was motivated to engage in the fraudulent scheme in order to enrich himself and elevate his stature as an entrepreneur.”

2. Cupridyne Clean Consumer- Media push coming
3. AOS- best known micro pollutants killer - after years of development finally in commercial trials
4. Cupridyne Clean - potential wide adoption (ODIN / Cannabusters)
5. Minerals extraction - in hard negotiations- Being a project manager, small partner, engineer, and building out the pilot facility of a $1 billion+ project sounds pretty lucrative
6. Successful Clyra Medical Product launch
7. EPA list N inclusion for Cupridyne/Clyra products
8. Garratt Callahan partnership- product they bring to market. ($3-4 Million early revenue expected)
9. Other Blest Projects. (Signed $1.2 Million in contracts within 10 days)

**The Bull thesis**

Commercialization is in full swing; revenues growing and debt paid off and at least one of those above mentioned endeavors will become a big success. More than one and we will do amazingly well - but it is actually looking good that a lot of not all will become a success = a potential Clean Tech Jackpot.

**The Bear thesis**

BioLargo has been a company operating for more than a decade and they spent way too long in R&amp;D without being able to significantly monetize their developments. As a “logical” consequence they will never be able to monetize anything and not a single one of the above will succeed.

**OP.**

It is very obvious that some folks got disappointed because they bought in BioLargo very early and missed buying back on the lows or averaging down.

So if you would hear about a  company that Besides many other promising endeavors - has solutions for two of the massive global water problems and a Billions of dollars bill just passed that is going to invest into clean water in the USA and the entire company is worth just around $50 Million- what would you think?

Right, It sounds too good to be true.

But folks it is not. We have been following BioLargo closely, and what they set out to do is actually happening (with some delays). There is no debt and progress is happening on all fronts.

It’s unheard of to have a purposeful company with that many promising endeavors at a price like this.

IMHO BioLargo is one of the best investing opportunities out there - the perfect combination - investing in the “clean” future while going for the big bucks.

71,investing,GadnukBreakerOfWrlds,"China will still allow IPOs in the United States, securities regulator tells brokerages","**This is to be honest the best news since the DIDI fiasco and all the news of many Chinese companies pulling their IPOs from the US market. Speculation of delisting of existing companies was ripe. But I guess China doesn't really want to kill their tech going IPO here as long as they follow all the rules that the govt lays down on them**

China will continue to allow Chinese companies to go public in the U.S. as long as they meet listing requirements, China’s securities regulator told brokerages late Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.

A series of regulatory actions in the last few weeks has heightened investor concerns that Beijing is trying to block foreign capital flows into Chinese assets.

The cross-border stock listings can also occur using the variable interest entity structure, the source said, citing the regulator. It refers to a legal structure which allows international investors to access shares of Chinese companies in the U.S.

The regulator recognized the structure is a vital way for companies to attract foreign capital, but said it would have to be adjusted if there were national security concerns, said the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

China Securities Regulatory Commission Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai held a virtual meeting with major investment banks on Wednesday, the source said. It followed days of sharp selling in Chinese stocks on fears of increased regulatory crackdown by Beijing.

Bloomberg first reported news of the meeting.

Chinese stocks listed in Asia and the U.S. — including big names like Alibaba and Tencent — plunged in the last several days as Chinese authorities increased scrutiny on tech companies over monopolistic practices and data security.

A policy document that began circulating widely Friday called for Chinese after-school tutoring companies to become non-profits, sending the stocks plunging by double-digits in Hong Kong and the U.S.

The policy specifically banned tutoring companies from raising money through the stock market or having foreign investors, particularly through the variable interest entity legal structure that allows international investors to access Chinese shares.

The speed and breadth of the policy surprised many. Goldman Sachs on Monday downgraded Chinese education stocks on expectations the after-school tutoring market would “shrink significantly” — to less than one-fourth its current $106 billion size.

However, the securities commission’s Fang said the policy was intended to reduce the burden on parents — not shut off foreign investment — and the education companies will have as much time as needed to restructure, according to the source.

The securities regulator did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

It’s planning to sell 45 million shares, which will have a 30-day lockup.

Uber shares fell 5% in extended trading following the report.

The value of Uber’s own Didi stake declined $2 billion last week following the June debut of Didi’s American depositary shares on the New York Stock Exchange, as China reportedly planned fines and other punishments against the company amidst a broader crackdown on U.S. listed Chinese companies.

SoftBank has lost about $4 billion on its Didi position in total, CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa reported.

The news comes one week after Uber stock rose slightly after the company’s trucking unit announced plans to acquire shipping software company Transplace from TPG Capital for around $2.25 billion.

Didi shares have fallen 37% from their $14.14 closing price on their first day of trading, June 30. Over the same period Uber shares are down about 8%.

AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage.

Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters.

AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips.

Centralized exchanges have never been safe enough, they will always be holding control on out assets, and I do not think anyone forgot about the Robinhood and GameStop incident, or the Thodex case. 

The main alternative for platforms like these is actually decentralized exchanges. Decentralized exchanges are financial platforms that allow their users to convert their digital assets, with the transactions getting recorded on the blockchain. And here is the main difference between the two options, investing in DEX guarantees you the right to retain control over your funds. 

Another guarantee for investors’ safety is the KYC policies followed by decentralized exchanges. Investors’ privacy is extremely violated when it comes to CEX, they are required to upload pictures with an ID verification and etc… meanwhile trading on DEX only requires a wallet connection, now which is a safer platform do you think?

The trading volumes on decentralized exchanges are growing constantly, which is why we are witnessing a high number of platforms, like UniSwap, PancakeSwap, and Merrymen, who are willing to offer 10% of their tokens for all those who were harmed in the Robinhood – GameStop fiasco.

3,investing,Lost-Guarantee229,Blackrock has plenty of upside and a good dividend,"**Valuation: Undervalued**

**Investment Thesis:**

· Blackrock has solidified themselves as one of the biggest investment managers/firms in the world, and their ability to have consistent growth is unparalleled.

o If you are looking for something that is safe and generally follows market trends, Blackrock is just the stock for you. Furthermore, with a dividend of 1.9% (which is also growing quickly) Blackrock could be one of the best dividend growth stocks around.

· Based off of the valuation techniques used in this analysis, I concluded that Blackrock should be valued at $1010/share, which implies an upside of 16%.

o However, with every investment there are risks/catalysts that cannot be forecasted, some of these are listed at the bottom of this report.

**Company Overview:**

[$BLK Stock - Blackrock Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/BLK) is an investment management firm with over $8T worth of assets under their management. Blackrock offers single and multi-asset portfolios that consist of equities, fixed incomes, and other financial instruments to their institutional and retail (individual) clients worldwide.

**Investment Information:**

Assets Under Management (AUM):

As previously mentioned, Blackrock has over $8T in assets under their management ($8.68T to be exact). What is more impressive than this level of AUM is their growth rate in their AUM. Over the past 5 years, Blackrock has averaged a 5-year CAGR of their AUM of 13%.

This is very important because a company like Blackrock ‘s investment management fees are earned as a percentage of their AUM. So, the larger their AUM, the more revenues they report in their financials, the higher their stock price.

iShares:

I guarantee that if you have ever looked for ETF to invest in that you have come across one of iShares ETF’s. Blackrock is actually the parent company of iShares, now you might be wondering why I am bringing this up and why it matters.

As of December 31st, 2020, Blackrock had $2.67T of their AUM in iShares ETF’s.

In total, iShares has 386 different ETFs with an average expense ratio of 0.31%.

When we do the math, iShares (owned by Blackrock) made $8.27B just off of the fees involved with owning their ETF’s last year from Blackrock’s clients alone.

This is very important because they are “double-dipping”. By this I mean that Blackrock is charging their own management fees, and then investing that money into a product (iShares ETF) that makes them an additional fee (on top of their original management fee).

Financial Information:

· Financial Performance (Good): In 2020, Blackrock was able to increase their total revenue 11%, their operating income by 3%, their net income by 10%, and their Assets Under Management (AUM) by 16.8%.

· Financial Performance (Bad): In 2020, Blackrock’s cost of revenue (total expenses) grew by 17%. The fact that Blackrock’s cost of revenues grew faster than their revenues is not good and contributes to a lower operating margin. This is seen in the decrease in their operating margin from 2019 (38%) to 2020 (35%).

· Dilution: In 2020, Blackrock only had one stream of share dilution which came from their convertible preferred shares. In 2020, there were 823,188 common shares that were issued due to the conversion of Blackrock’s Series B convertible shares. This share issuance had a dilutionary effect on Blackrock’s existing common shares of 0.5%. Overall, this 0.5% dilution is really nothing to stress over as an investor or potential investor in Blackrock.

*$SEIC Stock – SEI Investments Co:* SEI is an asset management holding company that provides a variety of financial services, tools, and instruments to their institutional clients.

*Valuation Information:*

WACC:

Through my own WACC model, I found Blackrock’s WACC to be 7.36%, which I used in my DCF model.

CAGR (2021-2026):

I found the average analysts revenue growth projection over the next 5 years to be a CAGR of 13.4%. I used this growth rate in the specified years. This makes sense and is closely related to Blackrock’s AUM growth rate.

CAGR (2026+):

I estimated Blackrock’s CAGR after 2026 to be 7%, I see this growth rate as reasonable therefore I decided to use it.

Operating Expense Increase Rate:

Over the past couple of years, Blackrock’s operating expenses have grown at an average of 7.87% every year. I decided to use this same growth rate moving forward.

Interest Expense Increase Rate:

Over the past couple of years, Blackrock has experienced an interest expense growth of 5.33% per year. I decided to use this 5.33% growth rate to forecast Blackrock’s future interest expense growth.

Depreciation &amp; Amortization Decrease Rate:

Over the past couple of years, BlackRock has been able to consistently decrease their depreciation/amortization figures despite having increases in their revenues/profits. Over the past couple of years, Blackrock has been able to decrease this figure at a rate of 14.26%, which I used to forecast future decreases.

Tax Rate:

I was able to find Blackrock’s effective tax rate for the year 2020 to be 20.1%. I was able to find this through their SEC 10-K filing. I used this tax rate throughout my model.

CAPEX Decrease Rate:

Over the past couple of years, Blackrock has been able to decrease their capital expenditures by an average of 2.5%/year. I used this to forecast future decreases in their CAPEX.

Risk Free Rate:

I was able to find Blackrock’s risk-free rate through a website called Finbox, who estimated it to be 2.25%

**Investment Valuation:**

DCF:

In order to value Blackrock’s stock ($BLK), I decided to undergo a DCF model. In order to complete this model, I used the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. My DCF model estimates the fair price of Blackrock to be $1,103/share, which would imply an upside of 26%. However, this estimate seems a little bit high, so I decided to do some comparable analyses to either support or disprove the DCF valuation.

Comparable Analyses:

P/B:

I compared Blackrock’s P/B ratio to their competitors (listed above in the “competitor information” section of this report). I did this because it is very common to value finance and financial services businesses through their P/B ratio since they have a lot of assets in their book value. By doing this I arrived at a fair price of Blackrock of $1130/share which implies an upside of 29%.

P/E:

By comparing Blackrock’s P/E ratio to that of their competition, I found that Blackrock’s fair value should be around $799/share, which would imply a downside risk of 8.5%.

EV/EBITDA:

By comparing Blackrock’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors, I found Blackrock’s fair value to be $641/share, which would imply a downside risk to this investment of 27%. As you have probably noticed, these valuations vary a lot and as a result of this I decided to take a weighted average of these 3 results to boil it down to one comparable valuation.

Weighted Average Comparable:

To carry out this comparable, I weighed the P/B valuation to be 50%, and the P/E and EV/EBITDA ratios to be split equally, each being weighted as 25%. I chose this split due to the importance of the P/B ratio when valuing financial businesses. By doing this, I arrived at a comparable analysis valuation of $925/share, which implies that Blackrock is undervalued by 6%.

Dividend Discount Model:

I was not able to undergo a dividend discount model due to the growth rate of Backstone’s dividends compared to their WACC.

This is both good and bad. Firstly, it is good for investors as they can expect Blackrock’s dividend to keep growing with their stock in the future. However, it is bad for me because I cannot use this model to further validate/invalidate my valuation.

**Plan:**

Buying Blackrock under $900/share helps to limit the downside risk of this investment, while still guaranteeing a good return.

Therefore, I see buying Blackrock under $900 as a good buy.

I would then look to sell a position around the $1010/share mark.

If you were to enter at current prices ($873) and sell for $1010/share, there would be a total upside to this investment of 16%.

**Risks:**

· Financial Performance: If Blackrock has a bad financial performance, it might spook both their clients and investors, which could have adverse effects on their share price. Additionally, if Blackrock is not able to meet their expected growth targets, some investors may sell off due to their valuation.

· Market Conditions: By nature, Blackrock will perform poorly under poor market condition. This is kind of the same for every stock, however more so for Blackrock as they are an investment firm.

**Catalysts:**

· Financial Performance: There really is not too many catalysts for companies like Blackrock other than their financial performance. This sis largely due to the fact that their business is based on good financial performances both for themselves and for their clients. If Blackrock is able to continue their good financial performances and continue to grow at the rate, they currently they will do just fine.

**Investment Thesis:**

· Lululemon represents a great investment opportunity as they continue their expansion into Asia, Europe, and China.

o If done successfully, this can help Lululemon launch their business to the next level, and drastically improve on their financial reports.

· Furthermore, Lululemon’s desire to grow is also exhibited through their acquisition of MIRROR, which they believe is an extension of their brands principals/image.

o If Lululemon can make changes to this business and scale it, there is another fantastic opportunity for future growth there.

· However, the valuation techniques used in this report argue that Lululemon’s Stock - $LULU, is currently overvalued. My models predict that $LULU price target is $362/share (implying a 9.4% drop).

o There are risks and catalysts that could potentially have large impacts on the share price, and my opinions on them as a company. These risks/catalysts are listed at the end of this report.

**Company Overview:**

[$LULU – Lululemon Athletica Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/LULU) designs and distributes their athletic apparel, and accessories to their customers worldwide. Lululemon’s goal is to continue to grow their cult-like following around the principals of exercise and health.

Lululemon is actively chasing this goal, which Is evident through their recent purchase of MIRROR, which is an in-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform with live &amp; pre-recorded classes.

Recently, Lululemon has set their eyes on further expansion into China, Europe, and Asia, which could be very lucrative if done correctly, as these countries/continents have large markets.

**Investment Information:**

*Business Segments:*

Lululemon has split their business into 2 main segments in their sec filings for reporting purposes. These two segments include their Company-Operated Stores, and their Direct-to-Consumer segment (DTC).

In 2020, their DTC segment represented 52% of their total revenues. This increased drastically from 2019, as in 2019 only 29% of Lululemon’s revenue came from their DTC sales channel. This increase is good to see as an investor as the DTC sales model tends to have better margins, which can help Lululemon’s profitability and help them report better financials.

In 2020, Lululemon’s Company-Operated segment represented 38% of their total revenues. This is a large decrease from their 2019 figure of 63%. Once again this is good to see as DTC tends to be favourable for companies.

This drastic shift away from Company-Operated stores, and to their DTC sales channel can be attributed to COVID-19. Many companies (including Lululemon) were forced to close their stores at the start of the pandemic, these companies were forced to either adapt or be left behind. Luckily for Lululemon, they already had an established DTC model, which helped them to adapt quickly and capture the online market very quickly. As a result of this, Lululemon was able to generate record revenues and increase their margins.

The rest of the revenues not accounted for belong to their “other” segment. This “other” segment includes their revenues from MIRROR, outlet stores, and pop-up stores.

*Company-Operated Stores:*

Despite the pandemic still raging on Lululemon was able to net an increase of 30 stores in 2020. Out of these 30 stores, 10 came from the USA, 17 came from China, 2 came from the UK, 2 came from South Korea, and 1 came from Germany.

If you did the math, you will have noticed that I just listed off 32 new stores, this is because I have not factored in the 2 stores that were closed down over the past year, 1 store in Canada closed, and 1 store in Japan closed.

As we can see from their Company-Operated Stores data, Lululemon is currently expanding into Europe and China. It is likely that we see this expansion continue in China and Europe, as well as a focus on starting to expand into Asia.

*Seasonality:*

Lululemon has acknowledged that their revenues are very seasonal, and that they tend to generate the most revenue in the fourth quarter. This is very common among multiple industries (especially retail) as it is the holiday season. However, Lululemon’s business is much more seasonal than most. This can be observed through their revenues in 2019 and 2020, in which $LULU earnings reported that 47% and 56% of their revenues in these respective years came in the fourth quarter alone.

This is important to know as an investor and is noteworthy especially as we approach $LULU stock earnings for Q4 (likely to be on January 31st, 2022). This jump in revenues is already somewhat priced in, however if we assume that 56% of their revenues comes in Q4 this year than we ca make our own estimate.

Using this 56% figure, we can estimate Lululemon’s Q4 EPS to be $2.74 \[(sum of Q1-Q3)/ (0.44)\] – (Sum of Q1-Q3). This implies that Lululemon will beat their earnings report in Q4 by 10.93% (Q4 EPS estimated to be $2.47 by taking the average of 8 analyst estimates) which may serve to be a catalyst in the future.

*MIRROR Acquisition:*

On July 7th, 2020, Lululemon purchased all of the outstanding shares of MIRROR, which is an in-home fitness company with both live and on-demand classes. It has been reported that this purchase was $500M. Of this $500M, Lululemon has reported that $360M of it is “goodwill”.

For those of you that do not know, “goodwill” is the difference between the purchase price of a business, and that businesses fair value of assets \[= (assets acquired) – (liabilities assumed)\]. In this case, Lululemon paid $350M over the “fair value” of MIRROR, this goodwill is valuable due to the reputation and the brand that the purchased company built.

In their SEC 10-K filing, Lululemon stated that they purchased MIRROR based off of growth, discount, and royalty rates that they believe the can make in the future. This is important as Lululemon believes that they can generate revenues and profits in the future.

*Financial Information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Lululemon was able to increase their revenues by 11%, increase their gross profit by 11%, increase their gross margin by 0.1 percentage point, and increase their DTC revenues by 101%.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Lululemon increased their cost of revenue by 10% (which is good because the increase in cost of revenue is less than the increase in revenues), their income from operations decreased by 8% (decreased operating margin), their revenues from company-operated stores fell by 34%, and their net income fell by 9%.

· **Overall Financial Performance:** It is rather difficult to give an opinion on whether Lululemon’s financial performance was good or bad in 2020. This is because there were economic factors (ie. COVID-19) that had adverse effects on businesses, which made some companies report “bad” earnings. However, the pandemic also helped many companies transform to digital, or helped companies (ie. Zoom) to have quicker adoption and report very good earnings. This dilemma is very prevalent with Lululemon as many retail and mall stores did horribly through COVID (Lululemon was no exception), however companies that adopted a social media presence and a DTC model were able to perform rather well (ie. Lululemon). Overall, I think that Lululemon had a slightly worse financial performance (as opposed to better). I think this because their DTC model should have helped them to achieve better margins and be more profitable, however the opposite happened and Lululemon’s net income fell.

· **Options Exercised:** In 2020, Lululemon issued 182,000 shares through the exercise of stock options. This issuance had a dilutionary effect of around 0.1%

· **Performance Stock units (PSU’s):** In 2020, Lululemon offered 171,000 shares through the vesting of performance-based stock units (PRU’s). These shares are given out to employees based on their performances and goals that they met. The issuance of these shares had a dilutionary effect on Lululemon’s existing common shares of approximately 0.1%

· **Restricted Stock (and shares) Units (RSU’s):** In 2020, Lululemon issued a total of 196,000 common shares as a result of the vesting of their Restricted Stock Units. This issuance had a dilutionary effect on existing shares of approximately 0.2%

· **Share Repurchases:** in 2020, Lululemon reported that they repurchased a total of 400,000 shares in 2020 alone. This repurchase offset the majority of Lululemon’s dilution for the year 2020, netting a total of 149,000 shares issued during the year. This brings the total dilution for 2020 down to 0.1%, which is essentially negligible. The fact that Lululemon has little to no share dilution even after acquiring MIRROR is a very good sign for investors and potential investors alike.

*Competition:*

In order to undergo my comparable analyses, I needed to find 4 companies that are comparable/similar to Lululemon.

These companies need to exhibit the following characteristics to be considered: be publicly listed, have valid financial ratios/multiples, have similar operations to Lululemon, and be of similar market cap.

By narrowing down the companies based off of the above criteria, I ended up with the following 4 comparable companies:

· [**$GOOS Stock – Canada Goose Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/GOOS) Canada Goose designs, manufactures, and sells their performance and luxury apparel for men and women. Canada Goose sells their products primarily in Canada but also in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Internationally. Canada Goose also sells their apparel in both physical retail stores as well as through their online store (DTC model).

· [**$LEVI Stock – Levi Strauss &amp; Co**](https://utradea.com/stocks/LEVI)**:** Levi Strauss designs, markets, and sells their jeans, shirts, other forms of apparel, and accessories in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Levi’s sells through 3rd party retailers, 3rd party e-Commerce stores, company-operated stores, and their company website (DTC).

· [**$UA Stock – Under Armour Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/UA) Under Armour develops, markets, and distributes their apparel, footwear, and accessories to their customers in North America, Europe, Asia, Middle East, and Latin America. Under Armour sells their products through wholesale channels, distributors, and through their DTC channel (e-Commerce store).

· [**$AEO – American Eagle Outfitters Inc:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/AEO) American Eagle is a specialty retailer that provides clothing and accessories to their customers in USA, Canada, Mexico, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, American Eagle is able to ship to 81 countries around the world through their online store (DTC).

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I was able to calculate the WACC through my own models. These models can be found in the DCF model. My WACC model estimated that Lululemon’s WACC is approximately 7.75%, which I used in my DCF model.

*CAGR (2021-2025):*

I used a CAGR that was between Lululemon’s gross profit growth rate over the past 5 years, and the average forecasted CAGR over the next 5 years. By doing this I arrived at a CAGR of 19.26% over the next 5 years.

*CAGR (2029+):*

I estimated lululemon’s CAGR for 2029 and 2030 to be 10 as it seems like a reasonable number given Lululemon’s growth. In the years between 2025 and 2029, I slowly tapered down the growth rate from 19.26% to 10%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate (2021-2025):*

In order to achieve this figure, I used the same approach as the CAGR. By doing this I arrived t an Operating Expense Increase Rate of 19%.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate (2029+):*

To predict Lululemon’s operating expense growth rate for 2029 and beyond, I decided to use 9%. I did this because the operating expense increase rate has always been relatively close to their CAGR.

*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*

Over the past couple of years, Lululemon’s average yearly Depreciation and Amortization growth is 15.47%. I used this historic growth rate to forecast the future growth in my DCF model.

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Lululemon’s tax rate to be 28.10% through their SEC 10-K filings.

*Capital Expenditure Growth Rate:*

Over the past couple of years Lululemon’s CAPEX has grown at an average of 2.2% per year. I used this historic rate to forecast their future growth rate.

*Risk Free Rate:*

I was able to find Lululemon’s risk free rate through a website called Finbox. Finbox estimated that Lululemon’s risk free rate was 2.25%.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

In order to arrive at a $LULU stock price target, I decided to undergo a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. In order to compete my DCF model, I used the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. By doing this, I found Lululemon’s fair value to be $459/share, which implies an upside of 15%. This is quite reasonable; however, it may be a little high and as a result of this I decided to undergo 3 comparable analyses to gather more information.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*EV/EBITDA:*

Through comparing Lululemon’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors (listed above in the “competitors” section of this report), I found that $LULU stock price target should be $311/share. If this were the case, there would be an implied downside to this investment of 22%. This is vastly different from the results achieved through the DCF model, so I underwent another comparable.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Lululemon’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors, I found that Lululemon should have a fair value around $160/share. If this were to come to fruition, there would be an implied downside to this investment of 60%. This is vastly different from the DCF valuation and is even very different from the previous comparable. As a result of this inconsistency, I decided to undergo one final comparable.

*P/E:*

By comparing Lululemon’s P/E ratio to their public competitors, I found them to have a fair value of $324/share, which would imply a downside risk of 19%. This result is somewhat consistent of that achieved through the EV/EBITDA comparable, however as a result of the general inconsistency among comparable analyses, I decided to take the average result from each of them.

*Average Comparable:*

By taking the average result of the 3 comparable analyses, I arrived at one, all-encompassing comparable valuation of $265/share, which implies a downside risk of 34%

**Plan:**

Due to the inconsistency between the comparable valuation and the DCF valuation, I decided to take the average result in order to draw one price target for Lululemon. By doing this I arrived at an overall $LULU price target of $362/share, which implies a downside risk of 9.4%.

My plan would be to wait for Lululemon to drop 9.4% (or to the $362 price target) before buying in.

I prefer this plan over shorting $LULU because I believe in the long-term prospect of Lululemon, and Lululemon has big reactions to news and is very volatile in the shorter time frames.

**Catalysts:**

· **International Expansion:** We know that Lululemon is looking to expand further in China, Europe, and Asia. These markets are huge and can be very lucrative for Lululemon if they are able to capture this market. If Lululemon does this successfully, their future financial reports should reflect a large increase in revenues due to this expansion, which should excite investors.

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Lululemon had a subpar financial performance. However, if they are able to fic this and report good earnings for the year 2021, they will get investors excited about the future growth prospect of Lululemon, which should help their price.

· **Q4 Earnings:** Based off of their seasonality I have estimated that Lululemon will beat their expected Q4 earnings. Obviously, I very well could be wrong here, however, if I am right their stock price should be benefitted by beating their earnings estimates.

**Risks:**

· **Financial Performance:** Overall, in 2020 Lululemon did not have the best financial performance. Although there were some good aspects of it, I felt that the bad outweighed the good and resulted in an overall poor financial performance in 2020. If Lululemon continues on this path of poor financial performances in 2021 then investors may lose faith in Lululemon’s ability to continue their growth, and consequently exit their positions.

· **Seasonality:** As we know, Lululemon has historically experienced seasonality especially in their Q4 financial reports. This kind of seasonality has already been priced in, to a certain extent, however if the seasonality starts to fade and Starbucks misses estimates, their stock could be negatively affected.

9,investing,nosalt69,GOOG and GOOGL Divergence Today,"I fail to understand Alphabet's two stock classes acting so divergent today.

As background, they stopped making sense to me once GOOG (the non-voting share class) rose and stayed above the price of GOOGL (the voting share class) in 2018.  Just doesn't make sense as to why an equivalent share of stock, with the added benefit of voting rights, would trade less than the non-voting shares.  SMH.

But today's action has me baffled again... Why would GOOGL rise $100/share while GOOG looses a few bucks a share?  Did Alphabet announce a share buy-back for GOOGL and not GOOG, or is there something else I missed?  I read through the earnings coverage, but I did not find mention of this.

10,investing,MP4_26,What’s your thought process when analysing crowdfunding opportunities?,"I’ve started investing using Crowdcube recently just as another way to diversify. I was curious how other people approach these types of investments. I’ve not really approached it with any great strategy and I’ve noticed that I seem to invest more frequently in companies with a physical product/application. Obviously I’m thinking carefully about the proposition, customers, competitors, the valuation, future funding and potential exit routes. But it’s not a strategy that I could write down. 

What I’ve noticed, is that I seem to have a bias against app/software based companies and maybe I need to have a coherent strategy rather than just analysing pitches one by one to ensure I’m getting a balanced portfolio. When it comes to non-physical propositions, I think I’m just very sceptical of a lot of the software companies that seem to do something that already exists. For example there’s currently an app crowdfunding where you can split bills with friends. And I just look at that and think surely if this was going to catch on, it would’ve happened by now? And a lot of these companies I believe are going to have to spend endless money to acquire customers, let alone keep them. 

Whereas a lot of the physical companies seem to be much more disruptive, a lot of them seem to be in the climate/eco space which I like. A lot of them have some sort of patent protection. And so I’m much more interested in them. 

I wonder if anyone else who invests using crowdfunding could help me see more of these opportunities in the tech space as worthy of investment?",1627496830,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/otfup3/whats_your_thought_process_when_analysing/

Three years ago u/warrenfgerald made a great post about the problematic nature of the growing size of the Fed Balance sheet and was totally skewered in the comments for it. He came from a naive POV and was merely asking a question about QE and how the FED acts as an independent fourth branch of government. I wish i could say that Bernanke was a liar when he told Dr. Ron Paul that the FED would unwind to pre-crisis levels but that would be giving him too much credit. Here we are in 2021 with almost $10 trillion on the books and the most noted economists see this as highly problematic. For the first time in US history questions are raised if the Fed will step into the equity business (it already buys corporate bonds). This is insanity on every level and economists all around are worried about the ramifications. I dont have an attention span big enough to make this post longer and more detailed.

Regulatory moves aimed at the education, property and technology sectors sparked heavy selling this week in Chinese markets, and have left global investors bruised and uncertain over the outlook for investments in Chinese firms. read more

In a front page commentary on Wednesday, the state-owned Securities Times said that systemic risks ""do not exist in the A-share market overall.""

""The macroeconomy is still in a steady rebound stage, and short-term fluctuations do not change the long-term positive outlook for A-shares,"" the commentary said.

""The recent market decline to some extent reflects misinterpretation of policies and a venting of emotion. Economic fundamentals have not changed and the market will stabilise at any moment.""

Other major securities dailies echoed the commentary in market reports.

In a front page story citing domestic fund managers, the official China Securities Journal said the sell-off was a ""structural adjustment"", a sustained plunge is unlikely and the market does not face systemic risk.

A story in the state-run Shanghai Securities News quoted domestic analysts as saying that the sell-off would not continue, and that the market will gradually stabilize.

""For institutions, the decline brings the opportunity for positioning in high-quality shares,"" it said.

What started off as a sell-off in shares on Monday had spread into fixed income and foreign exchange markets by Tuesday afternoon, sending the yuan falling through psychologically significant levels and pushing Chinese sovereign bond yields, and the cost of insurance against a default in China's dollar debt, higher.

39,investing,iKickdaBass,The Continued Bull Market Hypothesis,"The Delta variant is not a threat:

1. Texas, Florida, Missouri and Arkansas account for 60% of new cases. These states will not shut down. They will let the delta variant run wild. Those governors do not care. It won't affect business, unless businesses voluntarily choose to close. In some cases, it may motivate more people to get the vaccine. The vaccination rate is much higher in the NE, West Coast and in major cities.  The delta variant will have less impact on these areas than it will in rural areas.

2. Vaccinated people who get the variant don't end up going to the hospital or die at the same rates as those without the vaccine. Vaccinated people are getting minor symptoms. Almost all hospitalizations and deaths are coming from unvaccinated.

3. The CDC believes that 4.6 times as many people have had the virus and not tested for it than have tested for it. This means presumably that these people who had the virus and didn't get tested were not sick enough to get tested. JPMorgan thinks that about 70-75% of people have either had the virus or had the vaccine or both. So while it is a little surprising that the Delta variant is picking up steam, it probably will begin to peak much sooner than pervious waves simply because more people have been exposed to the virus than with previous waves.

4. Hospital workers are vaccinated at a higher rate than the public. One of the biggest reasons for the shutdowns was to protect our front line health care workers. This can no longer be used as an excuse.

5. The public will not stand for another round of shutdowns. It's not our fault some people don't want to get vaccinated. 

Fundamentals and valuation:

1. Markets are not good at self correcting based on valuation alone. Markets use data points to determine valuation and most data points coming in now suggest a continued bull market. Strong earnings, favorable monetary policy, continued QE until at least the beginning or middle of 2022, few competing alternative investments, clear evidence of transitory inflation, and a rebounding economy that will not shut down all suggest this bull market will continue to go higher. While there may be some profit taking and rebalancing that could lead to a minor correction of 5-10%, the markets will probably re-inflate to the same or higher levels unless there is new data points that suggest the fundamentals are becoming negative. 

2. We are in an upside down market: any bad news is actually good news. This is because any variant threats actually lower the Fed's desire to begin tapering. The longer the Fed runs its QE program, the higher stocks will go.

3. A major sell-off this close to the last is really unprecedented. There is actually more precedent that stocks will become extremely overvalued than there is precedent that there will be another sell-off this close to the last.

4. Major market sell-offs almost always precede or coincide with a recession. Right now, there is not any evidence to suggest another recession is around the corner. And if there was, the Fed and the democratically controlled government would step up with more QE and another round of fiscal stimulus which would drive equity markets higher.

5. How much higher can the market go? The S&amp;P 500 is trading at a forward PE ratio of about 21.5x. Prior to the pandemic, it was trading at close to 18.7x. It's about 15% higher. I think that is easily justifiable based on the more favorable monetary climate alone. For comparison, the CRB commodities index is about 20-25% higher than pre-pandemic. Historically, investors have been willing to pay as much as 25x forward earnings for the S&amp;P 500. So it's possible the market may test that level in the near future, so that would be a 16% run-up in prices. This compares very favorably to the downside risk, which I believe is probably somewhere near 5-10%, which are historically normal amounts for the market corrections. And remember, timing the market underperforms time in the markets, so most of the time, it's better to hold than sell.",1627395918,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/osntks/the_continued_bull_market_hypothesis/

54,investing,yes_i_abide,Odds of Toyota becoming the Blackberry/Nokia of automotives?,"Toyota’s top executives, [including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda](https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/), have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped” in part because of emissions associated with power plants — which is a favorite talking point used by the oil and gas industry.

[According to *The* *New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage), a top Toyota executive has met with congressional leaders behind closed doors in recent weeks to advocate against the Biden administration’s plans to spend billions of dollars to incentivise the shift to EVs. 

Last year, a group of car companies made a deal on tailpipe emissions with California, which had been seeking to set tougher rules than the US as a whole. Under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency had sought to strip California of its power to set its own emissions standards. But under Biden, that rule was reversed, allowing California and other states to impose tougher standards.

Toyota, which sided with the Trump administration in its battle with California, was not part of the original compromise. And the company has argued against EV-friendly policies in India and in its native country, Japan, as well.

Toyota’s behind-the-scene efforts to slow the momentum behind EV-friendly policies is surprising, given its status as an early adopter of battery-powered transportation. 

With the release of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the company helped pave the way for Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular. And more recently, the automaker has [revealed plans to release 70 new models by 2025](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru), including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and gas-electric hybrids.

But that doesn’t hide the fact that Toyota has fallen far behind its competitors, appearing content to rest on its laurels while the rest of the industry has lapped it several times. Companies like Nissan, General Motors, and Volkswagen have been selling pure battery-electric vehicles for years, while also revealing their plans to phase out gas cars completely. And Toyota’s failure to embrace EVs is not a new concept; [*The* *New York Times* noted as much in this article from 2009](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/energy-environment/20electric.html).",1627376093,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/osj46p/odds_of_toyota_becoming_the_blackberrynokia_of/

The yield on the most actively traded 10-year government bond rose seven basis points to 2.94% Tuesday afternoon, the most since in a year. The offshore yuan fell as much as 0.6% to 6.52 per dollar, through the key 6.5 level for the first time since April. Stock benchmarks in China and Hong Kong extended declines, with the Hang Seng Index plunging as much as 5.5%.

“There is a widespread rumor in the market that some U.S. funds are selling Hong Kong and China assets aggressively, as the U.S. may restrict investments in these places,” said Li Kunkun, a trader from Guoyuan Securities Co. “Although we can’t verify if it’s true or not, the market fears that foreign capital will flow out from the Chinese stock market and bond market on a large scale, so the sentiment is badly hurt.”

Risk aversion has emerged in China after a sudden policy change on education companies followed crackdowns on technology firms, raising concerns on a swathe of sectors in the equity markets. Curbs in financing for the property sector, and signs of an expanding Covid-19 outbreak are also weighing on growth expectations.

Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) by 2025.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips.

But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries.

Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years.

The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph.

""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors.

Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies.

In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive.

Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes.

Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say.

""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said.

Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip.

The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids.

But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology.

This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready.

""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

Chinese tech stocks are continuing their big sell-off as investors continue to digest Beijing's widening crackdown on private enterprise.

Meituan dropped 16% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, eclipsing Monday's massive 14% loss — making it the food delivery firm's worst two days on record.

That plunge — which combined, has wiped out more than $56 billion in market value for Meituan since Friday — came as Chinese regulators issued new guidelines Monday calling for improved standards for food delivery workers.

China's State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement that companies should take steps to ensure that riders make at least the local minimum wage, to reduce the ""intensity"" of the workload, and to ""strengthen traffic safety education and training,"" among other measures.

Meituan runs one of China's biggest food delivery platforms, with hundreds of millions of users making transactions on its app annually. The company said in a statement Tuesday that it had ""received and closely studied"" the new rules, and would ""strictly comply"" with them.

""We are committed to improving our compliance standards to protect the rights of our stakeholders, which include delivery riders,"" it added. ""We believe that the publication of the new guidelines will beneﬁt the healthy development of China's internet industry as a whole.""

Its shares have sunk more than 32% so far this year.

Other tech giants' stocks dropped, too. Shares of China's two most valuable companies, Alibaba and Tencent, also slid over the past 24 hours, with Alibaba closing down 6.4% in Hong Kong on Monday and falling another 4.6% on Tuesday. Tencent dropped 7% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, also extending Monday declines.

The Hang Seng TECH Index, a Nasdaq-like technology index that tracks the largest tech firms trading in Hong Kong, fell 4.5% on Tuesday, bucking the regional trend among many major indexes.

Take BABA and AMZN which are pretty comparable companies. But BABA is trading at 22 PE while AMZN is at 70. If you consider the underlying businesses fairly comparable, then the market is pricing in a risk discount of 60-70% in that case!!

It's fine and necessary to discount China stocks for their many fraud / regulatory / govt / VIE structure risks.

My question is not necessarily what happens to my position because it's clear that SPRT equity holders will translate into 8% ownership of the new company per the M&amp;A announcement. 

What is different here is that between when I purchased my call options and just recently, SPRT has become a short squeeze target due to its short float approaching 50% (Fidelity data as of 7/13, and StockRover premium data as of this week).

If this were to squeeze... does this affect the merger? Would short float ""carry over"" to the merged company?",1627332635,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/os7rww/stock_options_in_a_merger_situation/

Earnings: $1.45 vs. $0.98 per share expected
Revenue: $11.98 vs. $11.30 billion expected
Free cash flow: 619 million vs. -319 million expected
 
Cash
 • Operating cash flow less capex (free cash flow) of $619M in Q2
 • Net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.6B in Q2
 • In total, $912M decrease in our cash and cash equivalents in Q2 to $16.2B
Profitability
 • $1.3B GAAP operating income; 11.0% operating margin in Q2
 • $1.1B GAAP net income; $1.6B non-GAAP net income (ex-SBC1) in Q2
 • 28.4% GAAP Automotive gross margin (25.8% ex-credits) in Q2
Operations
 • Record vehicle production and deliveries in Q2
 • Successful launch of FSD subscription in July
 • Started delivering the new Model S to customers
 
Summary
In the second quarter of 2021, we broke new and notable records. We produced and delivered over 200,000 vehicles, achieved an operating margin of 11.0% and exceeded $1B of GAAP net income for the first time in our history.
Supply chain challenges, in particular global semiconductor shortages and port congestion, continued to be present in Q2. The Tesla team, including supply chain, software development and our factories, worked extremely hard to keep production running as close to full capacity as possible. With global vehicle demand at record levels, component supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for the rest of this year.
We successfully launched Tesla Vision in Q2, which was mainly possible due to our ability to use data from over a million Tesla vehicles to source a large, diverse and accurate dataset. Solving full autonomy is a difficult engineering challenge in which we continue to believe can only be solved through the collection of large, real-world datasets and cuttingedge AI.
Public sentiment and support for electric vehicles seems to be at a never-before-seen inflection point. We continue to work hard to drive down costs and increase our rate of production to make electric vehicles accessible to as many people as possible

24,investing,skurkles,Looking for insight on GRN (iPath Series B Carbon),"""GRN is a hot ETN (exchange-traded notes) that tracks carbon credit futures under the EUA and CER classification. An EUA is a European Union allowance that trades within the EU emissions trading scheme, while a CER is a Certified Emissions Reductions note that was created in the 2005 Kyoto Protocol under the Clean Development Mechanism.

GRN has seen a 85% growth rate over the past year, increasing in value from $10.65 to $19.75 in twelve months. As the COP 26 approaches this November, I assume that investors and nations will increase their attention on the carbon markets, because of how important these markets will be in determining their GHG reductions plans they must set at the conference.

If anyone has done technicals on this asset or has any information on the fundamentals of GRN from an investment standpoint please let me know below.""

In less than 24 hours, a 12-year-old child genius coder carried out  his own non-fungible tokens (NFT), making profits of more than US $  160,000. That boy is Benyamin Ahmed, the creator of the now-famous  collection “Weird Whales,” a sequence of photographs with multicoloured  pixelated whale shapes coined in the form of NFTs on the Ethereum  blockchain.

The NFT image of whale number 1,205 recently sold for around $ 6,000 and the total sales volume is almost 800 ETH.

Ahmed began coding when he was 5-6 years old, after his father, a web  developer for the London Stock Exchange Group, introduced him and his  brother to HTML and CSS.

“I created my first collection \[NFT\] on OpenSea just to have a little  fun, and then I got more interested in them when BAYC and other avatar  projects started rolling in. I also play a lot of games, from what I can  see NFTs come in handy as custom skins and cosmetics. ” He said

Each image in the Weird Whales collection, which can be found on the  OpenSea market, comes with a unique set of ‘features’ whose pixelated  design is evocative of the well-known CryptoPunks. Ahmed discussed in a  tweet thread how he used Python to help randomly create attributes for  over 3,000 unique designs that add to the value of each NFT.

This year, he used his summer vacation to study JavaScript and learn  more about computer languages. And, more lately, he has started to  investigate the NFT space. Ahmed, who enjoys video games, was  particularly intrigued by collectibles technology.

As a result, ‘Weird Whales’ started when one of the developers behind  another NFT project, Boring Bananas, handed Ahmed an annotated Python  script with a template to make his own tiered photos, according to  Decrypt. But the young man had no idea that his collection of 3,350  uncommon whales in NFT format would be so popular.",1627325706,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/os5eau/12_year_old_made_160000_through_nft/

**Government Intervention**

*March 31, 2021*

**1)** President Biden's $50B subsidy plan has the hope of strengthening U.S supply chains. This step is to help combat the heavily dominated Asian market. 

**2)** His plan includes increasing semiconductor manufacturing and research. Biden plans to invest in the National Science Foundation (NSF).

**3)** This will help fabricate semiconductors for computing, communications, tech, energy tech, and biotech under the CHIPS Act. 

* The CHIPS Act was introduced on *June 11, 2020*. The Act incentivizes the support of U.S semiconductor manufacturing, research, development, and supply chain security. The main incentive is an income tax credit for semiconductor equipment and manufacturing facilities.

**Conclusion**

	Meta Materials is going to take the market by surprise. They have a wide diversity of product applications across many industries. Industries include consumer electronics, health and wellness, aerospace automotive, and clean energy. META has changed the manufacturing process of chips. If NanoWeb can be used with any metal, including silicon, then imagine how much you can save on semiconductor chips. Instead of making full silicon discs, companies could use a plastic wafer and print the NanoWeb onto it. META's NanoWeb and holoOPTIC technology is unparalleled to the current competition. Their technology can be produced faster and cheaper than competitors. Their technology is way beyond our current imagination. 

	The semiconductor chip shortage is a sign. Chips are going to be as essential to our everyday lives as water. The shortage showed the U.S that they are behind the curve. The U.S wants to be in the position to not only supply themselves with chips but also export them to other countries. Biden's $50B plan will play a strategic role in controlling chip supply. META will also seek to capitalize on the semiconductor chip boom. The RML tech will change semiconductor chip manufacturing. This is a great long-term investment. Potentially one of the best silicon stocks to buy. Also, check out the \[META homepage\](https://metamaterial.com/). The video up on their homepage goes hard.

75,investing,Far_wide,Emerging markets - bit fed up with this lot.,"I'm a long-term passive buy-and-hold type of guy, and for many years I've held a small overweight in emerging markets (specifically Vanguard EM - (VFEM)).

I've never really lost faith as such in any broad-based index tracker, but I don't know, it just seems to perpetually underperform. Since 2012, VWRL is up 172% and VFEM only 59%.

My basic reasoning at the outset for having a slight overweight was that it would be these economies powering the long term future. Instead, it feels like they just continually suffer the worst combinations of natural disasters and government corruption pilfering profits.

So, I'm curious to gather views, do you still feel emerging markets are worth paying any attention to as a broad group for the long term 'boring' investor? 

Or are they only for those who want to be more active and select specific countries at specific times?

The energy consumed by fuel (oil) is at least 50% the total energy of a country such as the US.

Is the US building new grid power enough to pay for this coming spike in power demand? 

Utilities are highly regulated on how they can raise costs. Which makes flexibility in this kind of growing demand a big problem. 

This level of blow back is going to severely limit EV growth at some point and, if not well managed, it's going to damage the brand too.",1627232062,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/orf6mq/ev_market_might_just_crash_or_stagnate/

# BTI Fundamental Analysis 

&amp;#x200B;

# Price Target $50 – 28% Discounted 

  

## OUTLOOK

It is no surprise that e-cigarettes are fundamentally changing the tobacco industry. E-cigs have been around a while, but there is apparently less loyalty to certain old guard brands. Consumers are more and more health conscious, yet most likely conventional tobacco products will still dominant the industry for the next decade. Still, Big Tobacco companies are still investing into the new forms in order to win over customers. 

As of today, British American Tobacco has a very well hedged position in the new forms of tobacco consumption, thus preparing itself for a shift in consumer demand. Their Vype brand is becoming more and more popular in the United Kingdom, and they recently acquired Reynolds which gives them access to Vuse. In 2020 British American Tobacco spent GBP 121 million on research and development, yet that is much smaller than their competitor Philip Morris Tobacco who spent GBP 356 million last year. British American Tobacco (BAT) is also lagging in major new categories. In traditional tobacco products, BAT has taken 6% in Japan last year, but still not as much as Philip Morris. Nevertheless, BAT is determined to become more competitive and has set a target of GBP 5 billion of revenue generated from next generational products by 2025. Vaping has lower barriers to entry and lower profit margins than traditional tobacco by fire, therefore revenue growth might not be the key growth performance indicator. 

Notably, British American Tobacco has acquired Reynolds American to increase their stake in the combustible tobacco business. Reynolds American owns the brand Newport which still has a strong presence and consumer loyalty compared to others. Their volume is declining slower than others in the US and Newport’s are priced competitively. This is probably the major reason for recent weakness in British American Tobacco’s stock price as increased fears of menthol regulation and the strategic acquisition of Reynolds exposes BAT to the menthol category even more. 

## PRICE TARGET DRIVERS

My price target estimate for British American Tobacco ($BTI) is $50 which implies a earnings multiple of 16 times, 12 times enterprise value (EV/EBITDA), a free cash flow yield of 7%, and a dividend yield of 5%. For the most part, these estimates are mostly inline with BAT’s comparable of Philip Morris and Imperial Brands and the historical valuations that I pulled. I believe that this is appropriate given BAT’s positioning in traditional and next generational tobacco. 

The price target will all depend on BAT’s sustainability of the operating margins for the traditional combustible business, as I think that is what they are best positioned for. I assume a 1% sales growth which is below a consumer staples sales growth of 4% and below BAT’s comparable, Philip Morris. I am also assuming a volume decline over the next 5 years of 3%. Lastly, I believe the push to next general products, including vaping, will reduce the profit margins. I assume EBIT (earnings before interest &amp; taxes) is 39.5%, which is lower than last year. 

## SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

British American Tobacco holds a strong franchise in the tobacco industry, which is formed by their intangible assets and cost advantage. Obviously, government regulations in the tobacco industry have made the barriers to entry almost impossible. Consumers are also continuing to be brand loyal which is creating another intangible asset for BAT. Lastly, enormous tobacco conglomerates have the advantage of scale. 

### Intangible Assets 

Nicotine is an addictive substance which is hard to quit. Data from Tobacco Atlas states that more than 60% of smokers want to quit and as much as 42% have tried in the past 12 months. Nevertheless, globally smoking rates are barely declining which suggests that smokers have failed to quit. Also, academic research that I’ve read shows that failed attempts at quitting might be tied to premium price and brand loyalty. British American Tobacco has a very balanced cigarette portfolio, arguably one of the most balanced of all the major players. Their premium category generates around 25% of revenue, 33% in mid-tier categories, and the remainder in the affordable category. 

Government regulation combined with the fact that nicotine is addictive give BAT a competitive advantage as it reduces competition on prices. One example is that mass tobacco advertising is banned in most markets. New entrants into the market would have a hard time gaining attention. Also, the lack of marketing prevents brand switching and indirectly creates loyal customers. Compared to other industries, big tobacco doesn’t spend near as much as others in advertising. Only a mere 1.5% of sales is spent on marketing. However, it is possible that they will increase this as the next generation products, i.e., vaping is increasing in popularity. Furthermore, Point-of sale display bans don’t allow consumers to compare pricing and incentivizes brand loyalty. Therefore, manufacturers aren’t engaging in a promotional price competition. Another example of barriers to enter the tobacco industry is the US FDA. The marketing of new tobacco products is subject to FDA approval, which is not easy to get.

Brand loyalty remains loyal in the tobacco industry and I do not see any major changes happening in the near future. This is due to challenges to enter, regulatory barriers, and restrictions on marketing. Consumer brand loyalty benefits premium tobacco products more and puts British American Tobacco right in the middle of all of its competitors, such as Philip Morris and Imperial. 

### Cost Advantage

British American Tobacco’s business is very scalable. The more volume of cigarettes that BAT produce, the cheaper the production cost is. In 2020, estimated production costs of a pack of BAT’s cigarettes were $0.57 on a volume of 629 billion sticks. This is in the middle of their competitors, PMI and Imperial. 

### Good Sustainability 

Although counterintuitive in a declining industry, I believe that the British American Tobacco price target of $50 if appropriate because it is likely that the company will continue generating returns on invested capital for the foreseeable future. The sustainability of profitability and returns on capital will depend on future increases in tobacco prices that will follow inflation and declining demand. Based on past examples it seems that this is likely. In 2011, Australia implemented a series of anti-cigarette measures which led to more taxes being placed on tobacco. Over 6 years, the retail prices of cigarettes doubled and only led to a 3% drop in the smoking rate in the country. According to the World Health Organization, a pack of cigarettes now costs roughly $26 in Australia which is well above $17.80 in the UK, $6.50 in the US, and $5.50 around the globe. Assuming this example is applicable, there is plenty of room for Big Tobacco to raise their prices in order to continue being profitable. Therefore at 4% real pricing, incorporating a 2% global inflation, it might be two decades before British American Tobacco will not be able to generate rent. 

However, BAT’s recent acquisition of Reynolds American has lowered its return on invested capital generation (ROIC), and I would expect the company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to remain thin. Now that BAT paid $49.4 billion for the 57.8% of Reynolds, it will be limited going forward for new acquisitions. However, I believe that BAT will still be able to create excess returns on capital. 

## CAPITAL ALLOCATION

Balance sheet leverage increased when British American Tobacco acquired Reynolds American. In my opinion, the deal created limited value. BAT paid 10 times enterprise value/EBITDA for the company, which lowered their ROIC. However, acquiring the product Newport and staying on top of the competition will provide future benefits, similarly in 2011 when BAT acquired Protobacco for 11 times EV/EBITDA. 

Management has also been somewhat of a problem for BAT. In April 2019, Jack Bowles, former COO of the international business, replaced by Nicandro Durante as CEO. It is still uncertain how Bowels plans to turn the business around. Now with the growing demand for next generational products and with that comes lower profit margins, I would want BAT to focus on profitable growth vs revenue growth.",1627201601,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/or7uiv/full_research_report_dd_on_british_american/

85,investing,DarthTrader357,An interesting pattern in underlying price,"**Hypothesis:** Higher priced stocks return more proportionally to capital invested than lower priced stocks and with less risk.  
Possible conclusion: any investor should try to own as much of the highest priced stock they can if all other considerations were the same. So pick good returns from better valued stocks and stop gambling in the brambles.

Picking 4 stocks to test this hypothesis:

**Criteria** \- strike price should be delta 0.3 (-0.3) or lower delta. Price represents several tiers of expensiveness. ***IV has to be similar and BB has special commentary.***

BB ($10); GLW ($42); AAPL ($150) and I'll skip the next tier ($250) but that'd go to something like MSFT. Lastly we'll examine AMZN ($3600). So 4 tiers.

Basically 10s, 40s, 100s, low-to-mid-1,000s.

**Parameters** \- Do a Delta-30 covered strangle on the underlying - then divide the total capital by the premium. Similar IVs and Deltas mean those variables are less of a factor than the underlying price.

* The value of the underlying is not a consideration - only the capital is a consideration. It is assumed you bought the underlying at the price it is today which isn't ideal. But it assumes you will not be assigned at either strike price so do not realize any gains or losses from the underlying.

**BB - July 30**

* Call @ 11
* Put @ 9.50
* Net Credit: 24
* IV - 0.773 and 0.665 (Call - put)
* % premium versus capital = 1.22%

**GLW - July 30**

* Call @ 42.50
* Put @ 40.00
* Net Credit: 84
* IV - 0.464 and 0.422 (call - put)
* % premium versus capital = 1.03%

**AAPL - July 30**

* Call @ 152.50
* Put @ 146.00
* Net Credit: 345
* IV - 0.387 and 0.354 (call - put)
* % premium versus capital = 1.17%

**AMZN - July 30**

* Call @ 3740.00
* Put @ 3580.00
* Net Credit: 9375.00
* IV - 0.414 and 0.382 (call - put)
* % premium versus capital = 1.29%

**Comments on the IV:**

I had trouble finding a stock in the 10 dollar range that could support options equal to the majors. BB had some liquidity so went with it despite its higher IV. It's IV is about double AMZN's so if you adjust for IV it probably would have a payout similar to 0.60% to 0.80%. But, even at almost 2x the IV of AMZN it doesn't beat AMZN's return.

**Conclusions**: While this is by no means scientific, I think there's strong indication that for a similar IV, you're being paid more proportion of premium the higher up the price ladder you go. Another way of saying this is you're assuming more risk to get the same returns the lower down the price ladder you go. And therefore an investor should try to work their way up the price ladder as fast as possible.

A path might look something like buying GOLD (Barrick) in the $20s tier until you accumulated enough to then sell it and buy NEM or XOM or MO or BAC in the $40s - $60s tier, then trade out for JPM, AAPL, JNJ, PG, ABBV, etc. for the $110s - $150s tier then jump ship to MSFT in the $270s tier, TSLA in the $660s and AMZN in the $3,700s.

The idea is that premium on options represents how much return a stock can return, and if the premium is higher on stocks with similar Greeks but the only difference being the price, then we can assume that the price itself improves returns and the longer you invest in lower prices the more risk you expose yourself to, and the less returns.

BB is a great example.

No matter how much capital you put into it you get 1.22% return on premium, for twice the risk of AMZN.

And BB might fail while AMZN is going to space. Literally. Along with SpaceX and Virgin Galactic (SPCE). By the way, SPCE's IV is way too high right now to be reasonably compared to GLW, AAPL, and AMZN.",1627182729,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/or3w3z/an_interesting_pattern_in_underlying_price/

26,investing,The-Crazed-Crusader,A long-short momentum ETF needs to exist.,"Statistically, momentum trading has merits as top performing stocks over the past year, 6 months, or month tend to beat the market by 2% on average. This also applies to the short side where the worst performers continue to go bad often. A long-short strategy has the added benefit of uncorrelated returns to the market, meaning that a market crash is unlikely to effect this portfolio as losses on the long side are made up for gains on the short side.

The original hedge fund combined this with stock picking, and frankly that's how most of the thousands of hedge funds work these days. The thing is, we can cut costs and make this strategy accessible to everyday investors if we were to simply automate the process into an ETF by buying the top 50 stocks and shorting the bottom 50 stocks. We could have two versions of this ETF, one unleveraged and one 3x leveraged.

I personally have no means whatsoever of creating this products, but I would totally buy it if there was. Hopefully if the idea floats around here long enough some fund manager will get a bright idea.

All of which cause severe economic damage and may lead to some areas becoming permanently uninhabitable dead zones.

Add to this the issue of a slowing/declining population. The population growth in many western countries is slowing massively and many will be facing a declining population. This is leaving us with a huge burden of elderly people which the young workers will have to support through higher taxes. Doesn't this decrease the level of consumption that drives the economy? When there are fewer people able to consume?

----------------

On the other hand I hope to see us pull together as a species to fight and hopefully reverse climate change. With harsh regulations on emissions and with future technologies at our disposal maybe this will be achievable. 

And with the declining birth rate, depending on how much credence you give to the longevity movement we may start seeing medicines and therapies that make people live longer and more importantly healthier lives making them less of a burden on society in old age. I'm not sure how soon we would see these treatments available though.

35,investing,rideincircles,What do you expect for TSLA's 2nd quarter update on Monday and what are your long term expectations?,"This sub has been very quiet about discussing Tesla lately it seems. Just getting a status update on what everything thinks may happen this quarter and in the future.

Just to throw some possibilities around, here are some discussion points. 

What do you expect this quarter? Will it be enough to push Tesla back above $700?

Will having Bitcoin on the balance sheet gave an effect on their quarter? It's dropped some but not that much.

How do you think the stock will react if Tesla rolls out Full self driving that can drive people to work? The new subscription model is out, so FSDAAS is now an option, how does that effect their revenue next quarter and long term? How soon do you think FSD rolls out to wide release? It's already looking very impressive, but still needs some fine tuning. Will it be v10 or v11 that is capable? Is the processor enough to handle level 4 driving? What will be needed for level 5 FSD? 

How soon will the Austin and Berlin plants open up to prodiction? Are they duplicating problem solving of the 4680 Model Y line between Texas and Germany? Who is farther along? Is Berlin almost ready to go and just delayed by permit processes? Will the new factories be covered in solar panels?

What is the going forward plans for letting other auto manufacturers use the Tesla charging network? Will all new chargers be pass through with 300kwh charging? That will be needed for the cybertruck. How big will their charging network need to grow, and how will that effect their revenue? Will they charge more for other manufacturers? How do they set that up?

Will Tesla start manufacturing the semi soon? Do they have enough 4680 cells? Which location will be producing 4680 cells next, and is the final process completed?  

What the status on the updated cybertruck, and when will it be updated to show any other features? The 8 ton press has not arrived in Texas yet for the cybertruck castings.

What grid scale battery projects are they working on now?

What is delaying the S right now? It's hit pause on deliveries at the moment. Was the plaid fire a cause for concern on the battery?

Any further updates on the Model 2 and what's the plan for release on a $25k Tesla? How soon will it be debuted and when will it be released?

What's the plans for AI day? Elon said this month, but will we get an update? How far along is DoJo? Will it speed up training for machine learning? Will it allow for processing far bigger datasets for self-driving? Where is it going to be located? 

What else do you expect from Tesla and where do you see them later this decade? Can other manufacturers keep up with their battery innovation?

38,investing,nafizzaki,Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Announces Additional Actions to Prevent Foreclosures,"On June 24th, the Administration extended the foreclosure moratorium for a final, additional month until July 31, 2021 and the forbearance enrollment window through September 30, 2021, and provided up to three months of additional forbearance for certain borrowers. These actions were taken by three federal agencies that back mortgages – the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) provided similar relief for mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Specifically, where agencies have the authority and depending on homeowners’ financial conditions, agencies will require or encourage mortgage servicers to offer borrowers new payment reduction options to help them remain in their home.

HUD: The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced enhanced loss mitigation tools and simplified a COVID-19 Recovery Modification to help homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages who have been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These options will offer borrowers appropriate relief while preserving flexibility for future crises. FHA will require mortgage servicers to offer a no cost option to eligible homeowners who can resume their current mortgage payments. For all borrowers that cannot resume their monthly mortgage, HUD will enhance servicers’ ability to provide all eligible borrowers with a 25% P&amp;I reduction. Based on recent analyses, the Administration believes that the additional payment reduction offered to struggling borrowers will result in fewer foreclosures. To achieve those goals, HUD will implement the following options over the next few months:

COVID-19 Recovery Standalone Partial Claim: For homeowners who can resume their current mortgage payments, HUD will provide borrowers with an option to continue these payments by offering a zero interest, subordinate lien (also known as a partial claim) that is repaid when the mortgage insurance or mortgage terminates, such as upon sale or refinance;

COVID-19 Recovery Modification: For homeowners who cannot resume making their current monthly mortgage payments, the COVID-19 Recovery Modification extends the term of the mortgage to 360 months at market rate and targets reducing the borrowers’ monthly P&amp;I portion of their monthly mortgage payment by 25 percent. This will achieve significant payment reduction for many struggling homeowners by extending the term of the mortgage at a low interest rate, combined with a partial claim, if partial claims are available.  
These options augment additional COVID protections HUD published last month. These included the foreclosure moratorium extension, forbearance enrollment extension, and the COVID-19 Advance Loan Modification: a product that is directly mailed to eligible borrowers who can achieve a 25% reduction to the P&amp;I of their monthly mortgage payment through a 30-year loan modification.  HUD believes that the additional payment reduction will help more borrowers retain their homes, prevent future re-defaults, help more low-income and underserved borrowers build wealth through homeownership, and assist in the broader COVID-19 recovery.

USDA: The USDA COVID-19 Special Relief Measure provides new alternatives for borrowers to help them achieve up to a 20% reduction in their monthly P&amp;I payments.  New options include an interest rate reduction, term extension and a mortgage recovery advance, which can help cover past due mortgage payments and related costs.  Borrowers will first be assessed for an interest rate reduction and if additional relief is still needed, the borrowers will be considered for a combination rate reduction and term extension. In cases where a combination of rate reduction and term extension is not enough to achieve a 20% payment reduction, a third option combining the rate reduction and term extension with a mortgage recovery advance will be used to reach the target payment.    
 
VA: VA’s new COVID-19 Refund Modification provides multiple tools to assist certain borrowers in achieving a 20% reduction in the dollar amount for monthly P&amp;I mortgage payments. In some cases, even larger reductions are possible. One such tool is the new COVID-19 Refund option, where VA can purchase from the servicer a borrower’s COVID-19 arrearages and, if needed, additional amounts of loan principal (subject to an overall cap corresponding to 30% of the borrower’s unpaid principal balance as of the first day of the borrower’s COVID-19 forbearance). Similar to VA’s COVID-19 partial claim option, the COVID-19 Refund will be established as a junior lien, payable to VA at 0% interest. In addition, servicers can now achieve significant reductions in the dollar amount for monthly payments by modifying the loan and adding up to 120 months to the original maturity date (meaning the total repayment term can be up to 480 months).
 
FHFA: HUD, USDA, and VA’s steps bring federal agency options closer in alignment with payment reduction and loan modification options for borrowers with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages. FHFA’s existing COVID loss mitigation options provide servicers with homeownership retention tools for borrowers. The tools include a payment deferral option that allows borrowers to resume their pre-COVID monthly payment after deferring up to 18 months of missed mortgage payments into a non-interest-bearing balloon. The missed payments do not have to be repaid until the homeowner sells or refinances the property. Borrowers requiring more significant help may receive a loan modification that targets up to a 20% reduction in their monthly mortgage payments. The Flex Modification (Flex) capitalizes all past due amounts, extends the mortgage up to 40 years and in some cases lowers the interest rate and provides for principal forbearance. 
Additional Assistance

In addition to these new opportunities for borrowers, agencies across the federal government are also taking other steps to support borrowers as our economic and public health recovery continues.  

Homeowner Assistance Fund: In addition, the Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF), a critical component of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, provides $9.961 billion to states, D.C., territories, and Tribes for relief to homeowners impacted by the COVID-19 economic crisis. These funds can be used for assistance with mortgage payments, homeowner’s insurance, utility payments, and other specified purposes – and homeowners can access these funds in addition to the payment reduction options discussed above. And they will be integrated into the payment reduction options outlined above – providing additional payment reduction to borrowers who need it and to borrowers whose mortgages are not backed by federal agencies.
Extended Term Option: Finally, the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) recently announced it is creating a new security product for modified loans that would provide government agencies the flexibility to extend mortgage terms to up to 40 years, if they choose to do so, for borrowers who are behind on their mortgages and would benefit from the monthly payment reduction associated with this option.  Ginnie Mae expects this extended term product will be available for use in late 2021.
Giving Borrowers the Information They Need to Understand their Options

These new loan modification and payment reduction options will only give borrowers the relief they need if borrowers have the information to understand their options.

Homeowners can visit consumerfinance.gov/housing for up-to-date information on their relief options, protections, and key deadlines.
As federal agencies continue working to implement housing assistance for American families, CFPB offers this website as a one-stop shop for homeowners to learn about programs and resources that can help them stay in their homes by reducing the risk of eviction and foreclosure.
Borrowers should contact their servicer or housing counselor as soon as possible to learn more about the options available.

Last month, HUD, VA, and USDA announced steps to ensure that no new foreclosures are filed on mortgages backed by those agencies until borrowers are reviewed for new and improved options to make their monthly payments more affordable.
In addition, FHFA will continue to work with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to ensure that borrowers are evaluated for home retention solutions prior to any referral to foreclosure.
The CFPB finalized a mortgage servicing rule that requires most servicers to meet temporary procedural safeguards before filing foreclosures for most mortgages through the end of the year. The CFPB’s rules also require that mortgage servicers provide information to borrowers about their options.
For borrowers not currently in forbearance, there is still an opportunity to access relief. 

HUD, VA, and USDA announced that they will continue to allow homeowners who have not taken advantage of forbearance to date to enter into COVID-related forbearance through September 30, 2021.
Homeowners with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac-backed mortgages who have COVID-related hardships will also continue to be eligible for COVID-related forbearance.

\-Crypto

\-Physical Metals

\-Dividend Stocks

\-Cash for a house 

So right now ive been putting most money into crypto due to the bear market. I first started buying in feb 2021, so my cost average is kinda high and im just spending all my money DCA and buying under my average to bring it down. Plus i really do believe in the assets i invest in and i believe that it will give me the most capital gains, besides metals (Silver), i dont own anything else that would grant me large capital gains. I also want to save enough for an FHA loan down payment for a home i can house-hack and rent out. I dont have that much cash saved, but i do transfer it to a stable coin and stake for almost 8%APY. 

Dividend stocks i haven't bought in 10-11 months which is fine because im young so once crypto goes back up and the bull market resumes i will put money into divs again. Physical metals are the smalls part of my portfolio which im okay with because again im young, but would still like the exposure and its nice to collect. As of now, i can invest most of my check and im grateful to do so, but im only putting it into crypto.

 Im confident in my personal strategy of going hard in the crypto space until the bull resumes, as they are all long term holds and getting in now is good. I only have 1 coin im betting on to sell within the next year to use some cash for a down payment, but id just like to have some cash on the side too just in-case it doesn't do what i expect.

4,investing,skilliard7,Dividend Irrelevance Theory and Factor Investing,"Dividend Irrelevance theory is the belief that dividends do not impact total returns. Basically, for every dollar a company pays out in dividends, that is a dollar they do not have on their balance sheet, so a share of a company is effectively worth that much less, making the whole transaction irrelivant. It's for this reason that many smart investors suggest that chasing dividends is a bad strategy.

While dividends themselves are irrelivant, why is it that companies that pay dividends have provided higher historical returns than companies that do not?

Much of this can be explained by exposure to [Factors](https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/performance-measurement/fama-french-5-factor-model/)- most notably, the value factor, profitability factor, and aggressiveness of investment factor.

On average, companies with a low price to book ratio(value) historically have higher returns than ones with a high price to book ratio, Profitable companies have higher returns than unprofitable ones, and Companies with conservative asset growth have higher returns than companies with aggressive asset growth.

Dividend payers in general tend to lean towards these factors. A company that pays a dividend generally has conservative asset growth, as it must limit the rate it expands to be able to pay out the dividend. A company that pays a dividend generally targets profitability, as a steady stream of profits is required to maintain a dividend long term(and unlike buybacks, dividends are usually seen as more of a commitment)

And a company that pays a high dividend usually has a low price to book value.

Many professional investors target Factors to enhance their returns. Unfortunately, there really aren't any good ETFs or mutual funds that target all of these factors at once while maintaining low fees. This is especially true of the profitability factor.

However, by buying a dividend-based fund such as VYM, you get some level of indirect(but not perfect) exposure to these factors. It's not going to be perfect, as it will miss out on some value &amp; profitable companies like BRK that don't pay dividends, and include some currently unprofitable companies that pay high dividends(ie, in 2020 it would continue to hold XOM even though it is unprofitable). It may also occasionally sell profitable or value companies that cut their dividends.

But as a retail investor, this is the closest you can get to indexing with a factor tilt other than buying individual factor funds like VTV/VBR. The problem with many of these ""value funds"" is as follows:

1. Many of these value companies are not profitable, and are only considered value because of inflated valuations of assets on balance sheets. For example, Carnival Corp is included in many value funds despite being far from profitability. Profitability is a very significant factor in returns, and Value funds fail to screen for this.

2. These index funds only reconstitute annually. So Unprofitable companies like AMC and GME will continue to be held even after reaching highly inflated valuations. 

In addition to the factor benefits of dividend funds, there is also the liquidity. If you may need to withdraw from your portfolio, the advantage of dividends is they generally decline much slower than market price during downturns. This means that you will need to sell less shares of a high dividend fund to fund your expenses than a general market fund.",1627071572,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oqam2g/dividend_irrelevance_theory_and_factor_investing/

I am 20 years old. My goal is to max my ROTH IRA every year. (14k Vanguard)

other than my ROTH IRA I have a normal brokerage in Vanguard with about 12k in there.  

I also have a chunk of 9k sitting in TD Ameritrade, which isn't invested in anything. My hope was to invest this in individual stocks. I was okay with the risk. I wanted to become more knowledgeable in finding strong stocks and buying them.

I have no debt and my next year of business school is paid for. I have about 3.5k left in my savings with 2 months left to work. which will be 6k in my savings for next year. I live with my parents for the next two months so a cheap rent, gas, and small costs here and there is all I have to worry about. 

However, with working pretty much a full time job I have not had a ton of time to be able to do the research. Besides, I really only know the basics that were taught on TD ameritrades education center. I have messed around with the papermoney on Think or Swim and actually found a couple stocks that have done well, but of course I did not do it with my actual money.

16,investing,jjeff09,What is this strategy called? or is there a term? Selling Options etc,"So example.

I own no stock so far.

ABC Stock is $10.

I sell a covered put where when the ABC stock goes to $9.50, I will buy ABC 100 stocks @ $9.50 for $ premium.

The ABC stock eventually goes to $9.00.

Thus I automatically own 100 ABC stock.

Then I sell a covered call, where if the ABC stock goes to $11.00, I will sell ABC 100 stocks @ 11.00 for $ premium.

The ABC stock eventually goes to $12.00.

Thus I automatically sell the stock at $11.00.

So in this scenario/summary, my profit is $11.00 - $9.50 = $1.50 x 100 = $150 + $premium I got from selling the covered put + $premium I got from selling the covered call?

Could you create a 100 stock portfolio that beats the best Growth Mutual Funds most of the time?,"My best friend, who is retired and has lots of time on his hand is spending a good part of his day researching stocks and investing real money in about 100 different companies.

For years he told me how great he was doing but I doubted if his success was real.  Until he started to show me his actual portfolio five years ago and I started to track it online.

27,investing,DarthTrader357,INTEL - Why is it down on such good earnigns?,"TL;DR - *price moves down on positive earnings for a complex options-play reason and you need to look at how within the expected move the price change was.*

This is a concept I'm still trying to get my head around as well, but it's generally true. Earnings seems like a confusing time, good earnings sends a price lower, stocks on bad earnings sends a stock higher, why is the world upside down?

Perhaps someone can give a more technical explanation but it largely has to do with the ***bull put spread*** options strategy to capture expected moves.

An options trader in this strategy doesn't care that the price might go down somewhat - as long as it stays within the spread (**the expected move**) they make money. Quite handsomely.

Because an option's inherent volatility is dependent upon how negative the gamma is, as traders pile into ***puts*** to take advantage of the UPSIDE of a good earnings report while covering their potential downside, they cover their downside to within the expected range and not less.

They could cover it more but then you're eating at profits.

At the risk that if the expected range is bigger you lose everything (100%).

So as IV increases, gamma negativity increases which in turn means institutional investors **now need to sell stock when selling puts.**

Because institutional investors need to remain directionally neutral so they make money off the spread of selling puts and calls to buyers....to remain directionally neutral when their gamma is negative they need to sell.

This is why a BULLISH SENTIMENT drives the price like a tent peg right into the ground.

It's a temporary phenomenon of a very smart play where you can't lose as long as the earnings is bullish...you can easily lose if the surprise is negative and the sentiment turns bearish. But most people know when a stock is expected to have a good surprise and a company like INTEL was definitely bullish.

**Conclusion:**

* *A lot of bull put spreads were bought,* 
* *gamma became negative,* 
* *institutions with $billions invested had to sell short to remain directionally neutral,* 
* *price comes down.*
* *Evaluation of bullishness is how close to within expected range a stock moves. The closer to the expected range the stronger the bullish sentiment on th earnings. After all 300% returns aren't free. If something is good, it gets squeezed down into 8% returns or so.*",1627056954,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oq5qf3/intel_why_is_it_down_on_such_good_earnigns/

I own stock in the company I work for. It's a micro company and it trades OTC. 

Recently shareholders (myself included) voted to allow employees to buy and own company shares at a small discount during certain periods (after earnings reports etc). The document reads like the company will create new shares out of nowhere to sell to the employees. I didn't know a company could create new shares. Wouldn't the company have to have equity to sell as new shares? 

I'm using my company as an example but I'm more interested in the broader market. As an investor do I need to worry about a company creating new shares and diluting the stock? I'm not worried about a company selling existing shares from it's treasury and diluting the free float. I look at the value of the entire company, not just the float. But if a company can create new shares that are not in the Treasury that's like the fed printing new dollars. It decreases the actual value of each share and would be more like stealing.

62,investing,mikail_1,How to successfully invest in a tech startup,"First of all why? On one hand it’s seems to be one of the riskiest investment ever, on the other hand VCs (investment firms) are hunting tech startups and throwing money at them

The biggest advantage of investing in a tech startup is it can scale infinitely and quickly that’s why even if VC will have many unsuccessful investments the successful once succeed so big that the losses are covered. As an example an early Uber investor invested 100k which turned into $300M or 30,000% return 

Individual investors can’t afford to make too many risky investments but they have an asset that VC don’t have, as an individual investor you are not under pressure to make quick decisions and make a lot of investments, in case of VC they have to invest in many startups at the same time because they are managing big capitals that has to be in use. It’s a calculated numbers game for them

So how do you , as an individual investor, invest in a startup with a minimum risk and with the potential to create generational wealth. You need to look for couple of indicators: 

- how scalable the business is 
- Does it require labor or most of it can be automated 
- Can that startup Aquier customers at a profit or can it at least break even 
- Does the startup has good app/web app design 
- Is the app well coded and does not have lots of bugs 
- Does it have successful rivals 
- Would VCs be interested in this type of business 
- Would bigger companies potentially be interested in buying the startup in the future

As an individual investor you need to catch this startups in the seed round because once they passed the seed round they might start to get VC offers which individual investors will not be able to compete with

Making money in finances not in sales 

Here is how typical business makes you money. You invest in it, the business sells products or services and the dividends of the profit is distributed among investors 

Here is how you make money in tech startup 
You come in as a seed investor let’s say you put $100k for 10% of the company. the company starts to acquire new users-customers maybe at a profit or loss. It reaches certain amount of users and popularity to a point where a VC gets interested to invest in it. Let’s say in the first round it gets $5M from VC. Remember you had 10% of the business that you paid 100k for, now it’s worth $500k even if the business isn’t profitable yet. Well now the startup has $5M, the substantial amount of which will be put into marketing of the business. The business is growing and it’s time, you guessed it right, for the second round of VC financing, let’s say they put $20M, remember your 10% that you bought for 100k? Now they are worth $2M. Without the startup even having to be profitable. Now if at this point the business has 20k - 1M users the big companies will start to keep an eye on it and may even make an offer. Let’s say they offered $50M to buy the business, and now your 10% is valued at $5M without the business ever making any profits. 

A good example is Telegram app,it does not have any revenue yet but is valued at $30B.

You may ask, where is the value? Why would someone be so much interested in a business that is not generating any profit?

The value is in the future profits and in the user base that a bigger business can merge with. That’s what happened with WhatsApp and Facebook, FB used WhatsApp to share data with its social network.

I want to expand my portfolio into the upstream of Downstream of commodity and build sizeable dividends from it. Below is my DD, it has less to do with direct financials which seem sound, and more to do with mineral portfolios. Please jump in and discuss.

NEM vs. GOLD - NEM really is the evil empire. \*inside joke\* (because they really are the clear winner)

First off, my only consideration right now is finding decent underlying stocks that pay decent dividends with strong history of dividend growth.

**NEM**  
Newmont has a 10Y CAGR growth rate of 10.41% on about a 3.64% forward dividend  
[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM/dividends/dividend-growth](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM/dividends/dividend-growth)  


**GOLD**  
Barrick has a 10Y CAGR growth rate of -3.11% but stronger near term growth (though NEM is stronger even there). And a forward DIV of just 1.74%  
[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOLD/dividends/dividend-growth](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM/dividends/dividend-growth)

So for dividends it seems like NEWMONT is winning.

For mining operations:

***Newmont mines Gold, Copper, Silver, Zinc and Lead.***

***Barrick mines Gold, Copper***

So Newmont's portfolio is superior.

**FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS**

A little understood tidbit for those who haven't been in the gold industry (I've had such a diversified childhood, father and grandfather owned 3 gold mines in Nevada,. I worked for a prospecting company that found over 2 million ounces of Gold during my tenure there when I was in college. blah blah blah).

Gold mines often run into ore deposits that are rich with Molybdenum, a leading orebody for Lithium.

Now ***HISTORICALLY*** Barrick and Newmont have been selling the ore to China for molybdenum processing so China gets the Lithium and then China ships back the ore to (in this case) Nevada for gold and copper processing.

Gold and copper tend to exist in the same ore bodies as well, Barrick tends to do open pit so are in the copper belt, Newmont goes deep and tends to get the higher sulfides that's where all the lead, silver and zinc live...

Anyway...the point is:

***I have not yet heard back from EITHER NEWMONT or BARRICK on what they intend to do with their lithium***.

I don't know if contractually they are still obligated to hand over the ore to China for lithium processing.

I've visited a molybdenum processing mill at one of the Nevada sites, so, the US does have the capability.

**THIS IS A FUTURE** consideration for those wanting to get into upstream green energy.

Barrick sold a major interest in a molybdenum joint-venture in Canada and I think that is a mistake and represents weakness.

**Conclusions**:

Gold is the driver for both these stocks and that is bearish right now, but I think both handle their reserves of Gold very well and so the companies can perform well in bear markets for Gold. I think though, both are uniquely positioned to expand upon molybdenum.

As mentioned above, Barrick seemed to make a strategic error in their selling of a joint venture. I don't understand the reason for it when moly is heating up.

I don't know what Newmont's stake in moly is exactly but their reserves of Gold/Copper suggests they probably have good access to this resource.",1626998816,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/opqfux/newmont_is_this_a_good_long_term_buy_versus/

39,investing,supremefrenchprince,I made a completely risk free options trade,"How I Used Options to Set Up a Virtually Risk-Free Trade

**EDIT:** Since I've gotten a few comments about it, there is objectively zero price risk on this trade. The movement of the stock was largely irrelevant and the trade we set up would profit no matter where the stock went. There was some assignment risk on the short calls we sold, which we discuss in the second to last paragraph. This is entirely a broker-imposed risk which we were able to solve without too much issue. It is an important distinction to make though so I've added that up here to the top of the post.


I’ve been trading options for a while, but about a month ago I saw one of the most unique opportunities I’ve ever seen in the market. Here is an explanation of how I set up a trade that gave me a trade where the worst case scenario [was that I made a little over $2,500](https://imgur.com/7K4Z5MH)

This is about to be a wall of text so if you’re a more visual learner, here’s a quick video I threw together explaining it: [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/ui2HxTDByY4)

UPST first caught my eye back on June 9th when I came across news of its upcoming share lockup expiry on June 14th. For those who are unfamiliar, a share lockup is a pre-determined period of time where certain initial investors in a stock (usually institutions, pre-IPO) are not allowed to sell their shares. This is to prevent a mass selloff at IPO since these institutions are typically able to get shares in a company for far below what it ultimately is offered to the public at. Once that pre-determined lockup period expires, those entities covered by the share lockup are free to sell their shares as they wish. 

Now, a share lockup expiry doesn't always mean a stock will drop. For example, if an institution owned a huge number of shares at $22 per share and the stock was trading at $25 headed into a share lockup expiry, there probably wouldn't be a sell off because it's not worth it to unload a large position to lock in such a small gain. However if an institution had a bunch of shares for $22 apiece and the stock was trading at $160 headed into the share lockup expiry then there would likely be a decent sell off because they would be locking in a monster gain, and that's exactly what we were seeing with UPST. This stock had run up from $22 to $160+ between the IPO and lockup date, so you could bet that investors with a basis around $20 would be itching to close their positions out and lock in a huge gain. 

So with that in mind we knew that we wanted to play UPST down, but the question was how. I’m going to walk you through the thought process that ultimately led me to discover the risk free trade we entered.

**Idea #1: Covered Puts**

If you're familiar with a covered call, you know it's a bullish strategy where you buy shares and sell a call, hoping that the stock runs up to the strike of the call that you sold. What we tried to do was basically the opposite, a covered put where you short stock, sell a put, and then hope it drops to the strike of the put you sold. [Here is how that looks](https://imgur.com/Zc6MUXz), and [this is what the return profile on that looked like](https://imgur.com/gcbExAz), using www.optionsprofitcalculator.com.

So this trade accomplishes what we want because it makes us money if the stock goes down.
But let’s take a look back at the setup really quickly. There is one issue. With this play, we’re shorting the shares but the shares for UPST were listed as HTB, meaning hard to borrow. This occurs when a lot of people are trying to short a stock and the supply of shares available to be shorted becomes constrained. This is a problem because (1) a broker may close out the short position without notice, and (2) brokers charge high borrowing fees on hard to borrow stocks which would have cut into our profits. So how do we solve this? The answer is to open a position that is synthetically the exact same as shorting shares, which we did with our second idea.

**Idea 2: Replacing short shares with an option**

We solved the issue posed from shorting shares by selling a call with little to no extrinsic value. We did this by selling a 45 strike call, which was deep in the money. This 45 strike call had $111.25 of premium, which if you add those two numbers together (45 + 111.25) comes out to $156.25, almost EXACTLY the price of the stock at the time we calculated this, indicating that there is basically zero extrinsic value on these calls that we sold. 

[Here is what that setup looks like](https://imgur.com/bwZqJi8), and [here is what the results look like](https://imgur.com/wq16xVa). You’ll notice it’s very similar to what we first laid out, minus the risks associated with shorting shares of a hard to borrow stock.

So why does this work the same as shorting shares? Let’s say the stock drops $1. If you’re shorting 100 shares, you’ll make $100. If the stock drops $1 and you’ve sold 45c like we have, the price of the 45c will drop from $111.25 to $110.25, resulting in a $100 gain. So synthetically these are the exact same position, with the added benefit that we don’t have to worry about paying borrow fees or getting our position automatically closed out during the day by the broker. 

So that leaves us with [these potential outcomes](https://imgur.com/wq16xVa), however there is still a ton of risk if the stock shoots up. And this isn’t quite the zero risk play we’ve teased for this video. So let’s work on that part. What’s the best way to hedge that risk? What would protect us if the stock ran up? The answer is buying a call. 

**Idea 3: Hedging upside risk by purchasing a call**

We wanted to play UPST down, but the level of upside risk wasn’t within our personal risk tolerance, so we decided to hedge that by purchasing a call. [This is what the setup on that would look like](https://imgur.com/U1t1S6N). The important thing to note here is that we purchased calls at a 2:1 ratio to the call and put that we sold for the first two legs of this trade. This turns infinite upside risk into infinite upside returns and actually skews the trade bullish.

[This is what the potential outcomes of this 3-leg trade look like](https://imgur.com/Ys4TtUL), and you can see that this trade is basically risk free at this point, as movement below $45 is virtually impossible in such a short timeframe. However the title of this post would be a lie if we didn’t eliminate ALL price risk, so we’re on to Idea 4.

**Idea 4: Hedging the downside risk by purchasing a put**

Similarly to our upside risk hedge, we hedge our downside by purchasing 45p. That way any move below $45 is recovered on a dollar for dollar basis by the puts. These were going for $0.05 apiece so it was basically a $10 hedge to fully eliminate the downside risk [which gives us this setup](https://imgur.com/b0jVFl1). And finally, [that gives us these potential outcomes](https://imgur.com/7K4Z5MH). The website we’re using doesn’t even know what color to shade the boxes because there isn’t a scenario here where we lose money.

--------

All in all, this took about $16,000 of collateral and resulted in a trade where the worst case scenario was that we made $2,600, which is a baseline return of 16.25%. Not too bad for a few minutes of work. 

So now you’re probably wondering: Why did this work and what’s the catch? This works because we ran into a position where the extrinsic value on the deep ITM put that we sold far outweighed the price of the calls that we purchased to hedge the position. Extrinsic value is the portion of the option premium that is subject to theta decay and will be fully eliminated by the time the option expires. The value of our play was derived from the roughly $19 of extrinsic value on the 280p that we sold, which is really uncommon for such a deep ITM option. There was roughly a $17 difference between the extrinsic value on the 280p that we sold and the premium that we paid for the 240c that we used to hedge, which is what made our hedge turn our entire trade profitable. This is NOT typical to see in an option chain. The fact that the share lockup expiry was coming up for UPST provided a huge “put skew”, meaning that puts carry more premium at comparable strikes. This is what allowed us the opportunity to create this risk free play. 

You also might be wondering if we had to sell exactly the 280 strike on the puts and buy exactly the 240 strike on the calls for it to work. We modeled out a ton of different possible trades and strikes and this is the one that I felt gave us the best trade off between minimum (base level) return and maximum return. At the end of the day, as long as the extrinsic value on the put we sold was at least $4-5 greater than the calls we bought to hedge, we were going to find ourselves in a risk free trade. I give the $4-5 number because it’s tough to open all of these legs at once, so you might have $1 or so of slippage in getting the orders filled. A $4-5 gap is what I would be comfortable with for a trade like this in the future. In this situation, the difference was roughly $17. 

And last but not least, there is one little catch. I’m sure you’ve heard there’s no such thing as free money, but this is really, really close. Since the 45c we sold were deep ITM and had zero extrinsic value we were at risk of being assigned early. During the first week we were holding this trade, that happened. But there’s no need to panic. Getting assigned on the 45c now means that we are just short 100 shares which is the original position we wanted in the first place, so we’ll remember that the risk was our broker could close them out at any point and completely shift the return profile of the trade. To address that risk, we reached out to our broker, let them know our plan, bought back our short position, and sold another 45c with no extrinsic value. There is zero price risk on this trade, but rather a little broker-imposed risk that can be mitigated. 

So there you have it. An example of how we can use option selling strategies to take advantage of special cases in the market and set ourselves up with virtually risk-free trades. Thanks for reading and feel free to let me know if you have any questions in the comments, I’d be happy to answer. This is one of my favorite trades I have ever placed and thought it would be interesting to share.

I've seen about a half dozen Youtube videos where a particular individual will use a mathematical formula to come up with a price range for a stock.

57,investing,KingTimKap,TQQQ - The perfect ETF for a strong bull market,"What is the TQQQ ETF? It is a leveraged ETF that returns a multiple of 3x return of QQQ (an ETF that holds the top 100 largest companies listed on the Nasdaq) on a daily basis. For example, if the QQQ goes up 1.2% in one day, TQQQ will go up 3 x 1.2% = 3.6%. 

It seems that the general consensus among investors is that leveraged ETFs are a bad long-term investment mainly because these ETFs only multiply the return of the underlying daily. The implication of this is that there is a great deal of uncertainty over the long-term return of the leveraged ETF - there is no guarantee that the ETF multiplies the return of the underlying over longer periods of time.

The second main argument against leveraged ETFs is that due to the magnified movement of the underlying up and down, the math works against leveraged ETFs, causing them to lose value over time. For example, let’s say you put $1000 into the QQQ. It dips 3% one day, then gains 3% the next. At the end of the second day, you are left with $999.1. But, if you put $1000 into the TQQQ, it would dip 9% on the first day, and gain 9% the second day. But, you would only be left with $911.9.

People that support this point argue that this phenomenon causes the leveraged ETF to underperform the underlying in the long run, and, in many cases, even go down when the underlying goes up. Although there is some evidence to back this, a closer look at the historical returns of TQQQ and QQQ in green years would say otherwise. 

Since TQQQ’s 2010 inception, it has out-performed QQQ in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020. Since 2010, TQQQ is up 12,516.09%, while QQQ is only up a mere 677.3%. If you had put $1000 into both TQQQ and QQQ back in 2010, you would have $125,160 from TQQQ and $6,773 from QQQ. That means that the 3x leveraged ETF outperformed the QQQ by a factor of 18.5x, which is even better than the 3x positive return promised. Though, you might think that this is an unfair comparison because the same period where TQQQ was started was one of the longest and most intense bull markets (share prices are rising) in history. 

But, let’s look at another leveraged ETF: the 2x leveraged $SSO, which aims to return 2x of $SPY, the S&amp;P ETF. SSO was made back in June of 2006, right before the housing recession. SSO is currently up 523% since inception, while SPY is up 230%. They have both experienced the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 covid 19 crash, and yet the 2x leveraged ETF is still up significantly. In fact, it still outperforms the 2x leveraged ratio, with an outperformance of 2.27x.

Since the fund started in 2010, it never went through the housing crisis, or worse, the 2000 tech bubble which obliterated the NASDAQ, which brings us to the third main argument: if the QQ dropped 33.33% or more in one day, TQQQ would have to shut down, and any money invested would be lost. This has happened with some other leveraged ETFs that don’t have the positive decay that the S&amp;P, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq have (meaning, over the long term, the S&amp;P, Dow, and Nasdaq go up). Fortunately, the exchanges have circuit breakers in effect. The worst that QQQ can drop in a day is 15% in one day. Therefore, the max that TQQQ can go down in one day is 45%, which is highly unlikely.

Fun Fact: If TQQQ and QQQ were around in the 90s, and if you invested $10,000 in both of them (without reinvesting):",1626978027,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/opjqjw/tqqq_the_perfect_etf_for_a_strong_bull_market/

Think of it as Wix (website builder), but for automation and artificial intelligence, only Wix simplifies the process of web design for their users, while UiPath simplifies the process of designing and applying intelligent bots and automation. Their purpose, they claim, is “to accelerate human achievement”.

“Our platform leverages the power of AI-based computer vision to enable our robots to perform a vast array of actions as a human would when executing business processes. These actions include, but are not limited to, logging into applications, extracting information from documents, moving folders, filling in forms, and updating information fields and databases. Our robots’ ability to learn from and replicate workers’ steps in executing business processes drives continuous improvements in operational efficiencies and enables companies to deliver on key digital initiatives with greater speed, agility, and accuracy.”

What are its fundamentals?

* Market cap of 37 billion USD
* It has excellent gross margins, between 82-89% for the last two years. 
* They’ve cut their operating costs from $520M to $92M in just a single year, trimming their cost of sales and marketing from 144% of revenue to 62%.  
* It has generated revenues of $336M and $607M in the last two years, representing a growth rate of 81% Year over Year.
* They also disclose that their top 50 customers increased their spending by a multiple of 81x from their first month to present spending! In other words, the clients with the most money to spend couldn’t wait to give this company more money.

As of February 2021, they have 7,968 customers, including 8 of the Fortune 10 companies and 63% of the Fortune Global 500. They are also already disrupting the accounting industry. A representative from PricewaterhouseCoopers spoke about them saving 5 million hours of work by using UiPath, already saving them 500 million.

UiPath's product is an RPA(Robot Process Automation) process automation software that makes it easy to manage and deploy software robots, that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software. You may say that we have had process automation for a long time already. This is true, but UiPath takes this concept and makes it available to people that are not necessarily software developers. There are a lot of automation tools, frameworks and libraries out there but they are meant to be used by people with a software development background. Adding a high amount of usability to an existing concept is something that defines the success of some big tech players we currently have in the market.

Think about how many age-old processes are out there. Any job that is related to data operation is a possible subject for RPA. I’m sure that most people, including me in school, or others at work, have had to deal with a super boring repetitive task, such as copy-pasting something from a website into a spreadsheet, or something similar to this.

60,investing,KingTimKap,Palantir - A long Term Winner,"Palantir is an American software company that specializes in big data analytics, with a market cap of 43 billion. They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large data sets. Later, they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects. 

Any large scale company or business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Palantir creates software that consolidates a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible, easily digestible user interface for the company to use. This allows Palantir to work with companies/organizations like the CDC for medicine, the military for national security, etc. 

With Palantir, a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that Palanrie detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, Palantir had a huge hand in this. Palantir gives a visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that have risen (if any), allowing for fast response time. For example, Palantir could display a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator could click one of these shipments/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where things are going, and what kind of picture the data represents, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. This is just one example, Palantir is customizable enough where it can represent any business/organization's structure.

Palantir’s revenue streams consist of their two main software: [Gotham](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/), which was designed primarily for the defence and intelligence sector, and [Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector. For example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem. Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sectors. 

Gotham’s main tools include:

Gaia – lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.

Dossier – is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.

Video – an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.

Foundry’s main tools include:

Contour – enables exploration of large-scale data. Users can filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.

Object Explorer – allows users to interact with data represented as objects – like customers, equipment, or plants – rather than rows in a table.

As we know, Palantir started in the defence and intelligence space. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the start. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This was no easy feat, however, Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.

This is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has IL-5 clearance with the Department of Defense, which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance, alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP (Google and Snowflake have IL-2 clearance). It has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of classified information.

This level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir’s technology is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.",1626977526,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/opjkj7/palantir_a_long_term_winner/

The EV market is expected to grow at a [Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 21%](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html) and hit 30 Million Cars worldwide by 2030. By 2026, worldwide EV revenue is expected to hit roughly half a trillion USD. What's more, is that the Asia Pacific market where Nio is primarily located is reported to have the fastest growth. China is the largest EV market in the world, representing roughly 50% of worldwide sales.

“Nio's strategic goal is to have a consistent, stable order flow, rather than a fluctuating order backlog similar to Tesla. By keeping pricing steady, Nio's focus lies on services and customer experience driving a positive reputation in the community and keeping engagement high; it also allows gross and vehicle margin to find stable ground as volumes rise.” --- J.P. Morgan

BaaS - Battery as a Service: 

Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non-traditional manner, not including it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting customers choose and rent batteries depending on their needs. This shaves off approximately $10,000 off the price of their vehicles, which in turn boosts Nio's price competitiveness and demand. Also, BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit. Nio has hit roughly 1 million battery swaps so far, and these swapping stations even support the EV's of other automakers. This flexibility of compatibility with other EV's makes Nio-power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale. The BaaS gives Nio an extra revenue stream, it is easy to scale, and has brand visibility.

Nio also has the backing of the CCP. They have been given funding since the beginning by the government to produce a local EV vehicle. With the battle of international brands such as Tesla, the CCP will want a domestic brand to win this battle and won't mind giving more funding in the future given positive results.",1626976900,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/opjcfm/nio_the_best_bet_for_the_electric_vehicle_market/

63,investing,KingTimKap,DraftKings - The King of Online Sports Betting,"DraftKings is a daily fantasy sports app and sports betting operator, with a market cap of 23 billion. Sports betting is illegal in a lot of states in the U.S., but through DraftKings, you can select players from a team for a temporary fantasy football team and then play that team in tournaments for money. This is because most states consider fantasy sports a game of skill and not gambling. It's a loophole that allows a roundabout form of sports betting.

Sports betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything casino related or gambling, but the covid lockdown has started transitioning the legalization of online sports betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part, their revenues are *recurring*. Although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy online sports betting as a hobby and losing money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/ right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up fast. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1. Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.
2. Offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

Both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV), they will still be making a profit. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

In my opinion, DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing, they are securing market share in an industry that is going through massive deregulation and shift in policy changes. Thanks to aggressive partnerships, advertising, and market penetration, they are the leading player in the growing online sports betting and casino market.

They are an online mobile multiplayer competition platform with a market cap of 6 billion USD, which people use to participate in millions of mobile and online competitions across the world daily. Skillz doesn't directly create games but instead lets its third-party developers create them and then capitalizes on the opportunity to host online tournaments on the games. They have 95% profit margins because they have no game development costs!

Catalysts:

* Expansion to India (Indian mobile gaming market is growing twice as fast as the US and is much larger to begin with)
* Tetris and Big Buck Hunter are being added to the platform, as well as several additional games with tournaments being tested
* Monetization of non-paying players through ads
* The sale of the huge trove of customer data Skillz has acquired
* Skillz plans to expand to several additional countries in 2022, which alone could quadruple the revenue

They recently partnered with the NFL for a competition to have a game developer make a viral NFL game that will be cross-marketed by the NFL and Skillz. This submission period ends in May and we can see something by the beginning of 2022, and marketing later this year as well as a beta version. I expect tons of additional partnerships to roll out, as Skillz will likely partner with additional sports organizations and potentially gambling platforms such as DraftKings (the next stock in my proposal).

They have 618 million in cash on their balance sheet, with zero debt and tons of postings on their website looking for strategy analysts with M&amp;A and investment banking experience. I believe they are looking to acquire heavily to grow their presence internationally in the coming year.

*Fun fact:* Players on average spend around 62 minutes per day playing Skillz games, which is more than the average time spent on Tiktok, Snapchat, Facebook, and Netflix.

Skillz has a massive potential to be huge. The global gaming market now exceeds USD 300 billion, with a large portion of that market being in mobile and tablet gaming. With a current stock price of $16, I think that the company has the potential to grow and dominate the mobile esports market, and may grow upwards of $60 over the next couple of years, which is in my opinion, a conservative estimate.",1626976226,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/opj42c/skillz_a_rising_esports_giant/

*A regressive calculator's inputs, and boolean logic for operation.*

I just discovered there may be two divergent thoughts on how to adjust cost basis. I adjust mine in a diminishing return (regressive) calculator where the cost basis can never be adjusted to zero (0) and can never become negative.

The alternative is ***earn a dollar; subtract a dollar*** using a dollar-for-dollar (linear) calculator which can adjust your cost basis to zero if you earned as much income off a stock as you paid for it. This dollar-for-dollar seems to be useful and used to determine break-evens.

I don't think the dollar-for-dollar is as useful a metric because the adjusted cost basis should tell you when you should be buying and when you should be shorting a stock based on the stock's price.

The stock's price will hopefully never be zero and can never be negative, so the dollar-for-dollar ends up reducing your *actionable intelligence* vis-a-vis that stock.

Opinions may be good for the discussion, but opinions aside how do **YOU** adjust your cost basis?

While the second hand  market is expected to grow from $36B to $77B in the next five years, companies are already making moves to position themselves accordingly. 

While all the companies in the space have focused on building a platform for consumers to buy and sell directly between them (Poshmarck, Depop, Mercari, etc....) ThredUP has focused on building an infrastructure with a set of distribution centers able to process millions of clothing pieces.

4,investing,Adept_Chip,Enzolytics and Lonza Bioscience Combine Technologies to Fast-track Development and Production of Anti-HIV and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies produced by Enzolytics," 

Enzolytics and Lonza Bioscience are combining their respective technologies to fast-track development and production of anti-HIV and anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies produced by Enzolytics.

Lonza is a multinational chemicals and biotechnology company with major facilities in Europe, North America and South Asia. It has extensive development and manufacturing capability using advanced technologies to quickly and efficiently accelerate final production of monoclonal antibodies, complex proteins and recombinant proteins. Working from sequences of the antibodies produced by Enzolytics, Lonza will provide manufacturing, developability, stability assessment, process development and produce a stable cell line. Process de-risking and assessing developability and manufacturability will optimize and expedite the development of Enzolytics' Monoclonal Antibodies. Lonza's GS Xceed expression will be used for production. This will result in a significant reduction in time required for cell line creation, allowing for faster generation of clonal cell lines and ultimately reduced time to clinical trials. In addition, the application of Lonza's technology will significantly minimize the process development time and fast-tracks the IND application for both anti-HIV and anti-SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies.

Enzolytics Inc. continues to make progress with its defined protocol, including:

* Application of computer analysis (Artificial Intelligence - A.I.) to curate (analyze) the amino acid sequences of targeted viruses to identify the conserved, immutable, and neutralizable target sites (epitopes) on targeted viruses -

Enzolytics has identified conserved sequences for HIV, Coronavirus, HTLV-1, Influenza A, and B, and is in the process of doing the same for H10N3, H1N1 influenza, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Ebola, Small-Pox, Herpes zoster, Varicella zoster, Herpes HSV 1/2, Elephant endotheliotropic herpesviruses, Feline Leukemia Virus, Equine Infectious Anemia Virus, and Koala retrovirus.

Regarding the HIV virus, the Company has screened more than 87,336 HIV isolates, the largest known repository of HIV isolates known. From this extensive A.I. analysis, seven conserved sites (with up to 98% conservativeness) on HIV were identified. In addition, this analysis also confirmed that the site against which the Company's already produced anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies (called Clone 3) targets one conserved site on the HIV virus, which site is 98% conserved (either directly or by way of conservative amino acid substitutions) overall 87,336 HIV isolates curated (analyzed) by the Company using Artificial Intelligence. Using A.I., the Company has screened more than 50,512 Coronavirus isolates currently known and has identified conserved, immutable sites. Through the analysis, 19 conserved sequences have been identified on the Coronavirus on the basis that they are 98.71% to 99.29% conserved over the entirety of the 50,512 Coronavirus isolates analyzed. From these findings of 19 conserved, neutralizable sites (epitopes) on the Coronavirus, the Company is producing multiple (a cocktail of) targeted anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies. These 19 sequences were confirmed to be conserved in the Variants of Concern as well.

* Creation of cell lines to produce fully human monoclonal antibodies targeting each identified conserved virus site (epitope) -

Multiple broad neutralization antibodies are made in this step, targeting multiple conserved, immutable epitopes on the targeted virus. The Company's methodology for producing monoclonal antibodies is unique. Antibodies are created from human ""immune-B cells"", obtained from convalescent individuals who have recovered from the target virus.

The antibodies produced are not 'humanized' rat and mouse monoclonal antibodies where the original antibody affinity and specificity are not maintained, and the chances of immunogenicity are increased. In addition, the antibodies are not transgenic mouse models (a human immune system that has been ""grafted"" within a mouse model), having been ""vaccinated"" with specific and selected purified proteins.

* Production of Monoclonal Antibodies for patient therapy-

Working with Lonza Bioscience, the Company will produce stable cell lines for mass producing multiple Monoclonal Antibodies for application in the early stages of infection to treat or cure patients infected by the targeted virus.

The overall protocol offers the opportunity to implement A.I. analysis of existing viruses (or mutants thereof) and any new virus immediately upon its emergence anywhere in the world. Enzolytics protocol provides a platform for creating multiple fully human Monoclonal Antibodies targeting these conserved immutable sites on the virus - providing a necessary treatment of these viruses.

Charles Cotropia, CEO of Enzolytics, stated, ""We utilize Artificial Intelligence to identify conserved immutable epitope sites within infectious diseases and then use our proprietary fully human Monoclonal Antibody methodology to target these conserved immutable sites. Our primary goal is to advance our therapies to the clinic in an expeditious manner. Our mission is to translate our understanding of evolutionary biology coupled with Artificial Intelligence-driven fully human Monoclonal Antibodies into a therapeutic cure for HIV and SARS-CoV-2. We chose to partner with Lonza on this journey because of Lonza's deep experience and expertise in developing and manufacturing biotherapeutics. This agreement marks a key milestone on our path to expedite our clinical development and reduce time to the clinic.""

8,investing,mantegarvitrow5zv,"Volatile Oil Futures Jump 4.6% Wednesday As Inventories Dip, Key To Long Term Stock Valuation Of Allied Energy Corp. (OTCMKTS: AGYP)"," 

WTI and Brent Crude oil prices rose 4.6l% and 4.11%, respectively, in after-hours trading last night, according to oilprice.com. This is in reaction to U.S. oil inventories hitting an 18-month low, according to Bloomberg and MarketTradingEssentials, as oil industry equities advanced. That oil prices became very volatile last night is an advantage to Allied Energy Corp. (**OTCMKTS: AGYP**). Oil traders had told *The Wall Street Journal* in real time that they were betting on a decline in oil prices. That didn’t happen — oil prices and futures rose or held last night — contrary to the views of oil experts. AGYP stock closed last night off at $0.5499 in light trading (volume 279,294, only 60+% of average volume of 461,188). A U.S. government Energy Information Administration (EIA) report on last week’s drop in domestic distillate supplies and gasoline stockpiles was reported by Bloomberg. 

AGYP’s value rises as WTI and Brent Crude oil prices rise or hold because its assets-under-management (AUM) underlying valuation spikes against the price of global oil. As oil prices rise, so does the value of AGYP as it says it prepares to pump, particularly from its Well M-1 at its Green Lease location. Volatility in stocks of oil reserves and pricing of WTI and Brent Crude futures is due to larger economic issues including how much the Delta Variant strain of COVID-19 will impact global recovery. Demand directly impacts oil pricing. In this fast-changing environment, AGYP stands to gain when it begins pumping oil from its Texas-based wells at its Green Lease and Annie Gilmer Lease sites.

Two issues are in play with AGYP: revenue producing oil production at one or more of its well sites; and the price of WTI and Brent Crude oil prices. If AGYP can begin selling barrels of oil from its MI or K-3 Wells at its Green Lease site, that is significant to Small Cap shareholders — longs and shorts. As domestic and global oil reserves play against a very uncertain worldwide demand, larger oil pricing issues can make AGYP’s assets spike. 

Even oil traders quoted on Q3 and Q4 prices of oil expect “wild gyrations” ahead  in quotes as the market demand rapidly changes — due to COVID-19 and the Delta Variant. Should consumers mask or not, and even some 25% of medical workers remain un-vaccinated. In this changing economy, AGYP may flourish.

AGYP can only control its own leased well sites at its primary two locations. With one eye on oil pricing and the other on its own efficient use of new technology on  very old abandoned wells — its business model — it can deliver profitability as OPEC, UAE and other major producers have to confront COVID-19 Delta Variant economies worldwide. AGYP oil will always be valuable within the U.S., as it is new energy from proven reserves from older wells. Its oil pricing will have to be competitive with WTI and Brent Crude, but it will be a sure and local product. 

A PDF presentation prepared for AGYP by an oil &amp; gas expert consulting firm  said the Green Lease site said the site had originally been drilled back in the 1940s, but it has changed hands numerous times since and been under-utilized. AGYPs newest effort “will be the first to apply the most current drilling and production practices to the lease in 50 years.”

AGYP calls this site “historically underutilized” while nearby locations have produced production to date greater than six times than current production. Complex limestone reservoirs now are being drilled with extensive development “due to improvements in completion technology,” the company said in the PDF presentation. 

With this new drilling technology, AGYP estimates the Green Lease has the potential to generate substantial production. Studies show one section alone has almost $3 million in reserves on a $45/BO flat price deck. Adjacent lime lease sites are seen to have the potential of strong producers. New technology will enable AGYP to access these reserves, AGYP wrote in the presentation, prepared by privately-held Ardent Oil &amp; Gas Consultants, specialists in sub-surface geology and geophysics for ‘conventional’ hydrocarbon exploration.    

George Monteith, CEO of AGYP, is bullish on the Company’s new technology pumping the proven and probable reserves of oil on its lease sites. The AGYP-leased Gilmer site has produced in its lifetime more than five hundred thousand barrels of high gravity oil and more than five hundred million cubic feet of natural gas.

After the recent controversy surrounding the approval of Biogen’s drug Adu, a lot of attention has been brought to the Alzheimer’s disease space.  Time and again we have witnessed the failure of plaque reduction to translate into cognitive/functional benefits. 

     After recent success in there P2B trial &amp; open label study extension, the FDA has approved Cassava Sciences Simufilam to start phase 3 trials this year. Simufilam has a differentiated mechanism of action—targeting a scaffolding protein Filamen A to tame neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Simufilam has shown a consistent set of positive data supporting the mechanism of action.



      The p2B trial results have been reported but have not yet finished peer review. The pre print can be found here. This helps explain the MOA of action well. 

https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-249858/v1

It can be summarize as followed:

“ In a randomized clinical trial of 64 patients with Alzheimer’s disease dementia, simufilam 50 or 100 mg significantly improved multiple biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier integrity, with no safety issues. Collectively, results of this randomized controlled trial are consistent with the drug’s mechanism of action and replicate a prior, open-label study.20

Increases in Aβ42 and reductions in total tau and p-Tau181 imply reduced Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology. Reduced levels of neurofilament light chain and neurogranin suggest a slower rate of neurodegeneration. The 36% and 43% reductions in neurogranin, considered specific to Alzheimer’s disease,24 additionally suggest reduced disease pathology. Reductions in neuroinflammatory markers YKL-40, interleukin-6, sTREM2 and HMGB1 indicate suppressed neuroinflammation”

      Patients who have completed the p2B trial have been enrolled in a one year open label study extension. The open label study when completed will have 150 patients. After one year of treatment of open label Simufilam, all patients will be enrolled in a Cognitive Maintenance study with half being placed on Simufilam vs half on placebo. 
        On February 2nd of this year, Cassava released 6-month interim data from the first ~50 patients on the non-blinded open-label study of simu’ in AD. The analyses show an ~10% (1.6 points) mean improvement in cogniton as measured by the ADAS- cog11 scale. Additionally, these showed a 29% (1.3 points) improvement in dementia-related behavior (anxiety, delusions and agitation) as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory at 6 months as compared to baseline. From my understanding, mild to moderate ALZ patients decline 5.5 points on average on Adas Cog scale per year.
        I understand the limitations of an open label study, especially in ALZ disease. However, there are two decades of research that shows cognition improvement in Alzheimer’s patients peak at 11 weeks and diminishes at 22weeks in patients who are taking placebo. I am unaware of any study where Alz patients on placebo have had cognitive improvements after 22 weeks.  An improvement in cognition from 6 to 9 months along with its ability to show the reduction of biomarkers bodes very well for the success of Simufilam in its phase 3 trial.
       Simufilam has a differentiated MOA from treatments currently in use &amp; trials, which acts to correct the misfolded protein Filamen A. This is a small molecule interaction whose affect theoretically should not wane over time, thus there should be no tolerance or resistance issues. There have been no safety signals to date in its trials and there are no known hypotheses for Simufilam to cause safety issues as well. 
       Cassava Sciences is also working on a blood diagnostic test to detect Alzheimer’s disease. The results of this study will be available on Monday at AAIC. In theory, patients who have a  positive test can be placed on Simufilam years before the onset of symptoms in AD. 
       I remain cautiously optimistic for the success of Simufilam; ever since preclinical to P2, the drug is safe, biomarkers track improvement in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and healthy BBB. Study data follows the MOA models and no interventions during all the studies so far. If you look at Biogen, Eli Lily, or any Big Pharma trials, they all showed problems that lead to interventions and some ultimately abandoned the trials. I have not heard of a AD trial as trouble free as Simufilam. I do believe it warrants the attention of the medical community next week at AAIC. 

“On Monday, July 26th, at approximately 10 am ET, scientists for Cassava Sciences will show a poster presentation at AAIC, titled “SavaDx, a Novel Plasma Biomarker to Detect Alzheimer’s Disease, Confirms Mechanism of Action of Simufilam”.

On Thursday, July 29th, at approximately 11 am ET, simufilam will be featured in a live podium presentation at AAIC, including a brief Q&amp;A session. “",1626925028,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/op5v61/cassava_sciences_to_present_new_clinical_dataset/

52,investing,pranaman,1 and a half years into investing,"I started investing around Feb 2020. In the past I studied engineering and worked in IT, recently left a job, had some savings, and figured I'd learn and try as I go. 

I didn't know much, but I saw the 'Humbled Trader' and some other investors on youtube, and naively though ""how hard could this be?"" and thought I could figure it out. 

I read about day trading, watched many videos, then learned of swing trading. I paper traded on ToS, got a newsletter from Marin Katusa and made a few bucks.

Then, read a few trading books, learned of indicators, MAs, EMAs, MACD, RSI, using tradingview, tried scanning and different scanners, like finviz, the one in ToS, and others.

After more youtube videos and research, I realized there is a ton of information, tools, people peddling their method and realized what a swamp it really is.

So, now I know there are about 10,000 stocks, including ETFs if I'm not mistaken, and while I also invest in crypto, I would like to earn around $100-200+/day in swing trading. I don't have 25k in my account, so day trading is out for now. 

And from youtube ads, and other random findings, I've learned of Louis Navallier, Motley Fool, [stockgumshoe.com](https://stockgumshoe.com), stocktwits and more. I realize there's more information than I can sift through, even over many years.

I'm currently signed up with some paid newsletters:

* Doug Casey and David Stockman’s Contrarian Insider
* Jeff Brown's Near Future Report
* Just signed up with [swingtrader.investors.com](https://swingtrader.investors.com), as they have a free month trial.

I usually set a standard 15% TSL after David Morgan's [themorganreport.com](https://themorganreport.com) advice, another newsletter I had, and while there are so many ways to go about this, and I know it takes time to find one's groove, I haven't made as much as I thought I would this year.

I want to step out of the confirmation bias chamber and ask y’all about your thought on the $GME thesis:

- Hedge funds have naked shorted GameStop and the “meme stocks” to oblivion, the entire float several times over.

- Retail (and some Institutions) have been buying and holding since January, owning more than the actual float.

- Price is manipulated through dark pools, so even though these past days buy orders ounumber sell orders 7 to 1, it trades sideways or dips.

- These conditions have set up $GME to have the Mother of All Short Squeezes. If and when the short positions must close, their losses are theoretically infinite.

-Moass aside, GameStops fundamentals have changed. All debt paid off, $2 Billion cash on hand from direct offerings, expanding product line, e-commerce experts on C-suite team, crypto/NFT in production, and Ryan Cohen leading it all.


The bear thesis in my opinion no longer holds any water. I don’t see how this company can go bankrupt any time soon. And if it’s not going bankrupt, what do the short hedge funds have to gain from continuing to short and manipulate it other than living to die another day?

The three I know are Palo Santo, Noetic, and JLS Fund.   

I know some people are comparing it to the cannabis space, but it really looks more like a biotech niche, as most of these companies seem to be focused on the medicinal angle, and some are actually going through FDA clinical trials.  Never actually saw that in cannabis.  It's like the cannabis industry worked in defiance of the FDA while the psychedelics industry is working alongside the FDA. Also, I don't think any of these public psychedelics companies are angling for any kind of recreational market.  Not that I'm sure such a thing could ever exist , anyway.  

It's pretty early , but some of the early research is showing some pretty impressive results in terms of treating things like PTSD, anxiety, depression, and addiction.

# Big backtest on daily resetting leverage on the S&amp;P 500 index

### ""Leveraged ETFs Are Not a Long-Term Bet"" myth

[Daily resetting ETFs are often called a poor long-term investment.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/082515/why-leveraged-etfs-are-not-longterm-bet.asp) This is mainly because of volatility decay, also called beta decay. The most common example I see is that whenever the underlying index drops 10% then gains 10% the next day, a leveraged portfolio would lose a lot more value compared to the underlying.


Underlying: 100 -&gt; 90 -&gt; 99 - 1% loss

3x Leverage: 100 -&gt; 70 -&gt; 91 - 9% loss

A 9% loss is not a 3x of 1% loss!

A plot showing what it means in practice:

[Volatility decay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EivindAamodt/Stock-Market-Leverage-Backtests/main/volatility_decay.png)

What is often forgotten, is that the daily resetting also helps and serves as protection in some cases. Let's take an example where the underlying drops 10% four days in a row:

Underlying: 100 -&gt; 90 -&gt; 81 -&gt; 73 -&gt; 65 - 35% loss

3x Leverage: 100 -&gt; 70 -&gt; 49 -&gt; 35 -&gt; 24 - 76% loss

A 76% loss is a lot less than 3x of 35% loss. If it did not reset daily, the leveraged portfolio would be wiped out as 35*3 = 105% loss!

The same is also true when the underlying increases multiple days in a row:

Underlying: 100 -&gt; 110 -&gt; 121 -&gt; 133 -&gt; 146 - 46% gain

3x Leverage: 100 -&gt; 130 -&gt; 169 -&gt; 220 -&gt; 286 - 186% gain

A 186% gain is a lot better than the expected 46*3 = 138% gain.

# Conclusion

There is not a single 30 or 40-year timeframe since 1927 where DCAing into either 2x SPY or 3x SPY lost money compared to just buying SPY, even when holding through the depression in the 1930s, 1970s stagflation, the lost decade from 1999 to 2009, or ending the period at the bottom of the Covid-19 crash. 

Past performance does not guarantee future results and all that stuff, but it does seem like having at least a portion of your portfolio in leveraged index funds is a great way to increase wealth, with the rewards heavily outweighing the risks. The hard part is having to stomach watching the extreme portfolio drawdowns during market corrections.

The retail trading platform Robinhood is reportedly planning to start trading on the Nasdaq next week, making a public debut that comes with an unusually heavy dose of legal and regulatory disclosures. 

Robinhood, which expects a market value of $33 billion, faces ""numerous litigation matters,"" according to a recent securities filing. Those lawsuits, likely to be consolidated if permitted to move forward, include roughly 50 proposed class actions tied to its decision to restrict trading in GameStop (GME) and other so-called meme stocks in early 2021, according to the filing, which Robinhood submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday. 

The platform — whose stated goal is to ""democratize finance for all"" by offering commission-free trading — said it faces 15 proposed class actions over outages in March 2020. It also said it faces a half-dozen proposed class actions over a controversial practice called payment for order flow, which enables brokerages to make money despite not charging commissions.

But the regulatory risk that Robinhood faces could outweigh even this mountain of pending lawsuits against the platform, one expert said. Indeed, the company's new registration filing mentioned the word “regulation” 215 times. And many of those lawsuits might be dismissed, according to University of Michigan Law School professor Adam Pritchard. 

“There are a bunch of lawsuits out there,” Pritchard said. “For a lot of them, there's not much to them.”

Robinhood's filing pointed to proposed class actions filed on behalf of what could amount to millions of consumers, and another lawsuit filed by Massachusetts' attorney general. Both target Robinhood’s “payment for order flow” fee arrangement, claiming the company failed to inform customers that its commission free trades are supported by payments to broker-dealers.

Ultimately, the suits claim the fees disadvantaged Robinhood consumers by pushing their trading costs higher. So far, the practice has resulted in Robinhood reaching a $65 million settlement with the SEC. Separately the company was fined $57 million by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for allegedly violating brokerage industry rules. (Robinhood ""accepted"" the settlement with FINRA but did not admit or deny the allegations.)

The risk from regulators like these could be a greater threat than the many pending lawsuits, according to University of Notre Dame associate law school professor Patrick Corrigan. 

“First is Robinhood’s history of regulatory enforcement actions,” Corrigan said. “They've had settlements with the SEC, with FINRA — and they're facing actions from several state governments.”

“Second, Robinood's business model and practices push the boundaries of what broker dealers are currently doing with customers,” he said. That, he explained, separates the company from traditional financial services companies and underlies why regulators continue to probe the company’s tactics.

**'An alarming risk' for investors**

The company came under intense scrutiny in February when lawmakers on the House Financial Services committee publicly questioned Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev about the company’s payment for order flow revenue model — its largest source of revenue — and its advertising practices.

Pritchard, the University of Michigan law professor, said that while the collection of uncertainties is not ideal for a company that’s going public, Robinhood’s filing shows financial backers appear undeterred, despite the negative media coverage .

“If you were contemplating an IPO...you [normally] wouldn’t choose the point where you had just been hammered by the media and Congress in the last six months,” Pritchard said.

“It's not customary for a company that's just doing its IPO to have this much on its docket, that it needs to disclose, but you can be certain that the underwriters have talked to prospective investors, and don't think that it's insurmountable,” he added.

Still, David Trainer, CEO of the investment firm New Constructs, said Robinhood’s “mounting regulatory risk"" should be a red flag for investors and that the stock should be worth no more than $9 billion.

""Robinhood will likely not be able to continue the robust growth it saw in 2020 due to looming regulatory risk, increasing competition, and an undifferentiated service,"" he wrote. ""If regulators were ever to outlaw payment for order flow, Robinhood’s revenue would be severely affected, creating an alarming risk for investors.""

If that's a good metric to follow, does anyone have suggestions on how to easily tabulate that?

**The idea is so that I can ignore price action as a whole, and start looking at it through adjusted cost basis so I can make decisions based on that alone.**

45,investing,Cum-souffle,I would love to see brokers allow automatic portfolio management.,"If it's a feature somewhere, I haven't seen it yet. The idea is that you allocate a percentage of your portfolio to each stock. Say you have 2 stocks and $1000 capital, you allocate 70% to stock 1 and 30% to stock 2. $700 of stock 1 is bought and $300 of stock 2. 30 minutes before market close, stock 1 is up $100 and stock 2 is still at $300. The portfolio manager sells $30 of stock one, so that at EOD you have around 70% in stock 1, 30% in stock 2.

I feel like this would be great for holding long term stocks. You would automatically sell highs and buy lows on a miniscule scale, without needing to think about. This would of course be optional, and you could opt to just use the feature to adjust your portfolio when/if you want.

The real key feature would be grouping. Say you create 3 groups, one for tech, one for finance stocks, and one for pharmas. You allocate 50% to the tech stocks, 30% to the finance stocks, and 20% to the pharma stocks. Say you have 5 stocks in each group- the 5 in the tech stocks would each get 10% of your portfolio, with 6% in the finance stocks and 4% in the pharmas. You add a stock to the tech stocks group, and the portfolio automatically adjusts so that each tech stock now gets 8.3% of the capital.

47,investing,Nocturnidae,Bombardier BDRBF/BBD.B as a long-term investment,"I came on the investing sub about 6 months ago when it was around .45 and laid out my case that the stock would hopefully rise to around $4 or $5 long-term when looking just at TA.  But since that time I've become even more bullish about the stock and am thinking much higher for 3 years out.  The reasons are:

1)  private jet usage is still growing at an even rate ever since the Great Recession and since the pandemic, usage has grown much faster.

2)  the private jets services sector will bring in as much or more revenues to Bombardier and servicing companies such as Signature Aviation which was bid on by Blackrock and Bill Gates are all getting bought up.

3) fractional ownership companies such as VistaJets and Wheels Up are all doing very well and are planning to have IPO's soon through SPAC mergers which should drive up Bombardier share prices.

4)pricing of private jet tickets is coming down to the same price as a first class ticket on a commercial airline with much less headaches due to the increase of violence surrounding commercial flights with all the benefits of flying by private jets.  Set Jet is a leader on this front.

5)I still believe that low emissions technology concerning electric jets and hydrogen fueled planes will benefit small jets first which means they will hopefully be the next big thing after EV's.

6)For readmission into the S&amp;P/TSX composite index, their stock price would need to be above $1 for at least 3 months.  That could be as soon as September.  This will boost the stock price.

For those who have questions, I would watch the March 2021 Investor's Day presentation where they lay out a clear pathway for profitability of the company.

18,investing,MasterCookSwag,Determination of the April 2020 Trough in US Economic Activity,"https://www.nber.org/news/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-july-19-2021

&gt;Cambridge, July 19, 2021 - The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research maintains a chronology of the peaks and troughs of US business cycles. The committee has determined that a trough in monthly economic activity occurred in the US economy in April 2020. The previous peak in economic activity occurred in February 2020. The recession lasted two months, which makes it the shortest US recession on record.

&gt;The NBER chronology does not identify the precise moment that the economy entered a recession or expansion. In the NBER’s convention for measuring the duration of a recession, the first month of the recession is the month following the peak and the last month is the month of the trough. Because the most recent trough was in April 2020, the last month of the recession was April 2020, and May 2020 was the first month of the subsequent expansion.

&gt;In determining that a trough occurred in April 2020, the committee did not conclude that the economy has returned to operating at normal capacity. An expansion is a period of rising economic activity spread across the economy, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. Economic activity is typically below normal in the early stages of an expansion, and it sometimes remains so well into the expansion.

&gt;The committee decided that any future downturn of the economy would be a new recession and not a continuation of the recession associated with the February 2020 peak. The basis for this decision was the length and strength of the recovery to date.

&gt;**Further Comments**

&gt;The NBER’s traditional definition of a recession involves a decline in economic activity that lasts more than a few months. For example, the previous shortest recession occurred in the first half of 1980 and lasted six months.  However, in deciding whether to identify a recession, the committee weighs the depth of the contraction, its duration, and whether economic activity declined broadly across the economy (the diffusion of the downturn). The recent downturn had different characteristics and dynamics than prior recessions. Nonetheless, the committee concluded that the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warranted the designation of this episode as a recession, even though the downturn was briefer than earlier contractions.

**TLDR:** Recession is officially over, has been for a while, shortest ever on record.  Let's all go have a beer to celebrate!  

Personally, I think this one is gonna rank up there with the early 2000's recession in that it will have a pretty big asterisk next to it, for not being a particularly noteworthy",1626803954,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oo7d09/determination_of_the_april_2020_trough_in_us/
19,investing,DarthTrader357,"Why NEWS is misleading - July 20th, What really happened."," 

I have time stamped all my calls and before July 20th I time stamped that SPY would pin to $426. And by close of July 20th I stated that SPY would battle over this pinning.

But, and I have the historical calculations, was set to be pretty volatile around $427 and $428 so that is more likely where the bounce came from, pushing options holders expiring tomorrow to hedge by buying.

So what happened?

In the **NEWS** literally Monday was nothing but ""market sells off on Covid fears and inflation.""

***You can't make this up***

Today: ""Inflation temporary, market recovers.""

The NEWS simply doesn't know anything and now I'm fully convinced they just invent stories about why things happen.

***What really happened*** is that $426 on large open interest was gamma positive and price seeks higher gamma. Price pushed toward this nearest ""island of stability"" aka support level and pinned there on Monday until expiration.

Today, there are few islands of stability and since $426 was already very low considering over all market sentiment, influx of buying at cheaper near-term prices, has set off a typical buying cycle for negative gamma aligned markets.

In truth, it could have been pushed lower on negative openings to somewhere around $421, but then you have to say that people expect the SPY to be worth $421 by Wednesday. Does anyone really believe that?

No.

So the natural direction was bullish.

The next island of stability in the near term is forming around $432 - $433.

The price will seek those and by tomorrow might even become a positive gamma pinning point.

But as mining jurisdictions in countries like Chile, Peru, and others become more complicated, Ecuador is going on a different route and is rather shifting to a heavy mining-friendly stance. The newly-elected president, Guillermo Lasso (succeeding Lenin Moreno), [has a positive stance towards mining](https://www.mining.com/pro-foreign-investment-lasso-wins-ecuador-presidential-election/) and campaigns to promote foreign investments in the mining and oil sectors, while cutting tariffs on agricultural and other heavy equipment.

According to an [article](https://coringmagazine.com/article/challenge-opportunity-ecuador/) by Merlin Marr-Johnson, Executive Vice President at Salazar Resources Ltd., “Mining is the only Ecuadorian industry that offers growth potential as agriculture, tourism and the oil industry are ex-growth with structural problems, and the mining industry is keen to invest heavily and generate future earnings.” This is obviously acknowledged by a number of companies by engaging in drilling and exploration projects in the country. Here are some:

**Lundin Gold (**[**LUG.TO**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/lug.to/)**)**

They are mainly focused on the [Fruta Del Norte gold mine](https://www.lundingold.com/en/fruta-del-norte/project-overview/) in the country, inaugurating it in November 2019. The company purchased the Fruta del Norte gold deposit in late 2014 and now has 100% ownership of it, 8 years after it was discovered. It is situated within a 150 km long copper–gold metallogenic sub-province located in the Cordillera del Cóndor region in south eastern Ecuador. Its first gold production was reached in November 2019 and commercial production was achieved in February 2020.

There was a slight slowdown in production in 2020, but they [recently announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lundin-gold-delivers-another-quarter-123000622.html) the production of 108,799 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of this year.

**Solaris Resources (**[**SLS.TO**](https://miningfeeds.com/stock/solaris-resources-inc.-tsx/)**)**

The flagship project in Ecuador, which is the Warintza project, is focused on the Warintza Central resource, which covers \~700m of a 5km x 5km cluster of copper porphyries. The area hosts a high-grade open pit resource within a 5km trend of outcropping copper porphyry mineralization, with a number of untested, large-scale gold-in-soil and geophysical anomalies. It is adjacent to the +1Bt San Carlos-Panantza copper deposits and is the same belt as the Fruta del Norte and Mirador mines. Drilling the area[ already commenced](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/solaris-commences-maiden-drilling-at-warintza-east-major-porphyry-target-defined-at-yawi-866745755.html) and[ recently reported high-grade intercepts](https://www.mining.com/solaris-resources-reports-high-grade-intercepts-at-warintza-in-ecuador/) in the area.

Their shares[ recently rose](https://www.northernminer.com/stock-markets-investing/tsx-up-july-5-9/1003832739/) from $1.47 to $13.24, since the company released more assays from its flagship Warintza copper-gold project in southeastern Ecuador, about 85 km east of the city of Cuenca.

53,investing,hedonova,Investing in equipment leasing assets is a $800 billion business. Here's a ELI5 of how investing in equipment leasing assets works.,"For a more visually appealing answer: read the same post on Quora: [https://www.quora.com/How-does-investment-in-equipment-leasing-work/answer/Hedonova-3](https://www.quora.com/How-does-investment-in-equipment-leasing-work/answer/Hedonova-3)

&amp;#x200B;

Paul Getty’s famous quote, “*If it depreciates, lease it. If it appreciates, buy it,*” still holds true as more than 78% of U.S. businesses utilize equipment financing. These companies range from the largest bluechip mega corporations to venture capital-backed unicorn startups.

Take a situation where an airline wants to connect more cities and needs 50 Boeing 747s, each costing $200 million. That’s a total expense of $10 billion. There are three ways the airline can do this.

1. **Buy the aircrafts outright with cash in the bank.** Most companies cannot do this simply because it’s expensive.
2. **Borrow from a bank.** This is called *equipment financing.* The bank lends money to the airline to buy the 747s and secures the loan by having a lien on the aircrafts Meaning, if the airline cannot pay back the loan, the bank will take possession of the aircrafts. A lot of companies do not prefer this because it adds tons of debt to their balance sheets.
3. **Lease the aircrafts.** Where the airline pays Boeing a monthly fee to use their aircrafts. This works well for the airlines because it does not have to pay ten billion dollars up front, nor does it have to take on massive debt.

But does Boeing like it? Probably not. Boeing spends a lot of money, probably $8 billion or so to make those aircrafts and they want to be paid upfront, not in monthly installments.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Enter equipment leasing investors. Hedonova invests in equipment leasing assets too.**

&amp;#x200B;

Investors (it’s usually a syndicate of investors) purchase the aircrafts from Boeing for $10 billion. It’s usually lesser because firms are happy to provide a discount or pay a financing fee. Let’s say 5% $500 million. This goes right into the investor’s coffers.

Now let’s assume the investors lease the aircraft to the airlines at $200 million a month for a 20 year period. This way the airline pays just a fraction of the cost which can be funded with revenue from day-to-day operations and the investors earn an **annual return between 18% to 22%**.

&amp;#x200B;

# The tax advantage

Assets depreciate in value over time and accounting guidelines allow depreciation to be booked as an expense, hence letting the investor disclose lower profits and save on tax. For example, if the investor has purchased $10 billion worth and has earned an income of $15 billion on it as lease, it does not have to pay taxes on $5 billion. Assuming the aircrafts depreciated $3 billion during this time, the taxable income for the investor is just $2 billion now.

&amp;#x200B;

# Advantages of equipment leasing

1. **Regular cashflow.** Investors earn a regular and predictable cash flow from leasing out assets.
2. **Low risk.** Equiments are normally leased out to mega-corporations and venture-backed startups that usually have proven business models. Investments are also secured against the equipment itself. So if the companies default on payments, the equipment can be taken back and leased to someone else or sold. Companies generally pay a security deposit which covers a few months of non-payment, reducing the risk further.
3. **Low correlation to financial markets.** Equipment leasing as an asset class is stable and has no correlation to the vagaries of the stock markets.

Either way, their ideas are pretty similar. Leverage yourself using debt and purchasing assets that give you money.

# Methodology

Using a traditional 60/40 model is a good way to reduce volatility, but it also reduces returns. To compensate, I used a leveraged version of the 60/40. Historically, [leverage of 2x yields the highest returns](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php). By making 70% of the portfolio a 2x version of the 60/40 model this brings the average up to 1.7x leverage. Keeping the leverage slightly below 2x keeps volatility under control.

71,investing,mrpoopybutthole1262,[Stock Discovery Method] Social Media Analysis And News Sentiment data.,"Ive been a big fan of using social media and mainstream news stock sentiment to find upcoming stocks.  It a great discovery method.

I thought i would share some of my findings.

**Main Stream News**

Let's look at the top 10 companies mentioned in the mainstream news in the past 4 weeks:

*  Amazon.com, Inc.
* Netflix, Inc
* Pfizer Inc
* AstraZeneca PLC
* Apple Inc
* Marcus &amp; Millichap, Inc
* Tesla, Inc
* Facebook Inc
* Twitter Inc
* Microsoft Corporation

[Source.](https://stock-shark.com/)

Nothing out of the ordinary here, mostly blue chip stocks. Pfizer and AstraZeneca have dominated the news cycle mostly because of the vaccine rollout. 

[Google search trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=SG&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0gvbw,%2Fm%2F028zbs) show and increase in interest roughly the same time as the pandemic started. Pfizer still showing allot of momentum.

Many of these stocks are pretty overvalued unfortunately, with an EV to sales ratio of more then 5. Pfizer is about 6\~. Personally not my thing.

**Google Search Volume**

However lets look at the top 20 stocks in terms of google search volume, in the past 4 weeks:

* Tilray, Inc.
* NIO Inc.
* Tyme Technologies Inc
* ELive Ventures Inc
* AstraZeneca PLC540
* CCIVChurchill Capital Corp IV
* Atlantic Power Corp
* Snap Inc.
* Netflix, Inc.
* Visa Inc
* Uxin Ltd
* Casa Systems Inc
* Aurora Cannabis Inc
* Realty Income Corporation
* AT&amp;T Inc.
* GTT Communications, Inc.
* Canaan Inc.
* JD.com, Inc.
* Reliance Steel &amp; Aluminum Co
* Pandora Media Inc

[Source.](https://stock-shark.com/)

Many overvalued stocks here, with a EV to sales ratio more then 5, (NIO is at 283!). However if we do a quick analysis of each company, we can find a few gems.

For example [JD](https://stock-shark.com/stocks/JD), has a EV to Sales ratio below 1, a very high market share, and a avg revenue growth of about 8%\~. Not bad!

So why is this company so undervalued? Well a quick scan of recent headlines show the Chinese gov cracking down on many Chinese tech companies. Many negative news headlines have scared investors away. However company fundamentals remains strong. It might be a great time to buy!

Using this discovery method ive found some really great gems, ill post about my track record soon.

74,investing,Success-Dangerous,What is the deal with stock index futures ??," 

Hi All,

I'm trying to wrap my mind around stock index futures. I understand all the online guides but something doesn't fit. So to enter a position on a stock index to my understanding, I need to shift funds into a margin account, the amount of which depends on my broker, and by doing so I am gaining exposure to the index. The margin account will then be credited every day based on the movement of the index.

However, if this is true, don't really need to pay a premium for the contract itself, I just make sure to cover the margin, and I'm in. So if I'm not paying another trader to obtain the contract, why is there an order book ? what is the meaning of, say, the current ask price, if I don't need to pay it to obtain an index future ?

It seems like the orderbook price discovery determines the notional value of the contract, which is what we compare to the real index to calculate my PnL, but since nobody is paying the prices that are in the book to enter / exit their positions, why would they move ?",1626745969,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/onseqx/what_is_the_deal_with_stock_index_futures/

Gold is a product often associated with long-term goals and stability. Investing in this asset might seem like the best option for those who are looking for it to be a safe haven investment.

44,investing,Nimesh_India,3 Main Reasons Why to invest in gold..??,"It’s natural and even very important for an investor to check whether an investment in a particular asset is a good investment or not. More sensible in the case of true for gold. In India, people hold the gold for their future plans like marriage &amp; other cultural rituals, convert black money into physical gold or gold certificate, and other personal financial goals depending upon ambition.

As a being of entrepreneur/ service class person, 

Why would you invest in gold?
Use as a currency.
In the global market gold is the only currency that has completed around 3000 years in the global market. It has the longest currency track record as compared to other currencies. In the global market there other currencies are available which has more value as compared to gold. But if we compared the track record of gold vs other any currency, gold has more long-term holding value.

Keep in mind that gold always has some value &amp; you sell it when you need currency. That is the reason you need to add gold investment to your portfolio.

Inflation Hedge
As we all know, inflation rises, the value of the currency goes down. Except for gold. In long run, almost all currencies depreciated over the period of time but the gold price increases. Also when inflation rates exceed the interest rate the saving instruments may not pay well, but gold pays the fare amount. This is how gold acts as an inflation hedge.

Keep in mind that, Gold has its own real rate of return.

No specialized Knowledge is Required.
Buying gold is way much straight forward. No training, equipment, tools &amp; tackles are needed to recognize the gold.  As nowadays we can buy gold in physical form or in digital form as per our storage &amp; security requirements.

Other Benefits like you can take the loan against gold, easily transferred to next-generation, a value never affected due to geopolitical tension, easily liquified in any shop, best replacement of stock &amp; real estate market investment and does not deteriorate with time,

Conclusion:

Make your financial profile more diversified. Because if inflation occurs, the value of your equity-based investment goes down but the value of gold arises dramatically.",1626718346,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/onjpyu/3_main_reasons_why_to_invest_in_gold/

# Brigadier Reports Balance of Phase-1 Drill Results from Picachos

  

**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / July 6, 2021 /** Brigadier Gold Limited (the ""**Company**"" or ""**Brigadier**"") (TSXV:BRG | FSE:B7LM | OTC PINK:BGADF) is pleased to announce further drill results from exploration of newly identified gold targets at its Picachos gold-silver-copper project Sinaloa, Mexico (the ""**Picachos Project**"", ""**Picachos**"" or the ""**Property**"").

Brigadier has received analytical results for diamond drill holes DH-BRG-044 to -050 from SGS Laboratory. Principal results are from 47, 48 and 49, a fence of holes drilled across the northwesterly trending El Placer Vein system (see table below).

In the winter of 2021, the Company completed underground sampling of several historic gold mines along the northwest part of El Placer.

Highlights from underground sampling obtained prior to diamond drilling include:

* 31.4 g/t Au, 11 g/t Ag, 0.2% Cu, 0.5% Pb and 2% Zn across 0.3 meters from Tacuachas Underground Level 1030 (BRG-25139)
* 2.14 g/t Au and 0.1% Pb across 8 m from a surface trench across Tacuachas Open Cut (BRG-117146)
* 7.43 g/t Au, 0.15% Pb, 0.23% Zn across 3.2 m from Lentes Underground Level 1024 (historic sample MCA-27431). This result includes 0.15 m of 40.63 g/t Au with 0.2% Pb and 0.2% Zn
* 4.64 g/t Au, 0.1% Pb and 0.1% Zn across 0.9 m from Corallio Underground Level 1035
* 38.88 g/t Au, 22 g/t Ag, 0.4% Cu, 1.7% Pb, 1.5% Zn and 538 ppm W (tungsten) across 0.5 meters in Chivera Underground Level 1177 (BRG-27106)
* 12.79 g/t Au, 8 g/t Ag, 0.1% Cu, 0.9% Pb, 0.9% Zn across 1 m in Los Huaraches Underground Level 1155 (BRG-25131). This includes 0.1 m of 117.45 g/t Au, 57 g/t Ag, 0.2% Cu, 3.2% Pb and 2.6% Zn

Host rocks to the mineralization are mainly rhyolitic ignimbrite. Regionally, these are pervasively silicified and brecciated within the El Placer Vein system. Microcrystalline quartz, epidote and base metal sulfides such as galena and sphalerite occur in the silicified matrix between rock fragments. Gold is concentrated in shear zones marked by argillic alteration with or without quartz veining.

DH-BRG-047 is completely mineralized and returned an overall result of 0.41 g/t Au with 0.2% Zn across 60.3 meters. From the geological model, it appears to have tested a series of shears in the hanging wall to La Botica represented by Tacuachas, Coralillo, Los Lentes and at least two newly defined structures in the footwall to Tacuachas. Notable individual results are 4.03 g/t Au, 4 g/t Ag, 0.2% Pb and 0.1% Zn across 0.5 m, correlated to the Corallio Vein and 1.49 g/t Au with 0.3% Zn across 1.8 m correlated to Los Lentes Vein.

The main results from DH-BRG-048 are in the top of the hole. The interval between 3 and 4 meters contains 6.89 g/t Au with 0.04% Cu, 0.1% Pb and 0.1% Zn and is correlated to the Tacuachas Vein. Between 14 and 18 meters an intercept of 1.85 g/t Au with 0.1% Pb and 0.1% Zn defines a new shear zone in the footwall to Tacuachas with a maximum value of 5.51 g/t Au across 1 m between 16 and 17 m.

DH-BRG-049 tested under Cerro La Chivera and returned an average result of 0.27 g/t Au with 0.01% Cu, 0.1% Pb and 0.2% Zn across the entire length of 123 m. Between 7 and 8 m, values of 2.85 g/t Au, 0.04% Cu, 0.1% Pb and 0.4% Zn correlate to the Tacuachas structure. La Botica, defined underground about 600 meters southeast of this drill hole, strikes through DH-BRG-049 between 40.5 and 56 meters downhole with a peak value of 1.08 g/t Au returned across 4 m between 52 and 56 m. Chivera is correlated to the interval between 77 and 95 meters with peak values of 1.1 g/t Au, 0.4% Pb and 1.7% Zn occur across 4 m between 77 and 81 m and 3.51 g/t Au and 0.1% Pb across 1 m between 92 and 93 m. Finally, Tatemales, historically exploited underground about 300 meters southeast of this drill hole fence, projects through DH-BRG-049 between 98 and 123 m.

Brigadier has cut a 69 meter long surface trench using the D6 along approximately the same line as DH-BRG-047. By using the bull dozer, a more accurate assessment of surface gold mineralization will be attained. This trench was sampled at 1 meter and 0.5 meter intervals using a chisel and hammer to channel across the rock (dry sampling). Results for the machine dug trench are pending.

Another company just sold $20M of shares in the last two weeks at 25% more than it's trading for today. If it was a fair deal then, it's a great deal now.

Companies that hold portfolios are trading far below NAV. You literally cannot buy those holdings yourself at those prices. 

Add the inflation problem the shorts have. They don't owe money, that is going down in value. They owe shares in things like miners, that produce goods that are going up in price.

Then, the US government is sending out enhanced baby bonuses, some of which will end up in stocks.

I strongly suggest people listen to the conversation with Russell Napier. It applies all the lessons from Asia for investors trying to peer over the horizon. Napier recently flipped from being a deflationist to calling for a permanent rise in inflation driven by bank lending, government guarantees, and credit rationing, and this has direct implications for those of us trying to navigate a terrain that feels unprecedented when it really isn't.

This week in 1921 (July 18-24, 1921), the main market themes are:

* Potential end of the 1920-1921 recession (equity, debt, commodity markets)
* Status of German WWI reparations as set forth by the Treaty of Versailles and overseen by the Reparation Commission (currency markets)

**Quick Stats:**

* *DJIA: 68.11 (Today: 34,688)*
* *Shiller PE Ratio: 5.2 (Today: 37.9)*
* *Federal Reserve Bank of NY Discount Rate: 6.0% (Today: 0.25%)*
* *GBP/USD: $3.58 (Today: $1.38)*
* *Price of The Wall Street Journal: $0.07 (Today: $5.00)*

**Executive Summary:**

* The severe deflationary effects from the June 1920 Federal Reserve discount rate hikes all the way up to 7% (known as the discount rate today) litter both newspapers in the early part of the week.
   * **Historical Fact:** 7% was the highest Fed discount rate until the 1980s.
* The Federal Reserve lowers the discount rate to 5.5% from 6% on July 20, 1921 and over the next couple days the broad market improves by a few percent; commodity markets (oil, rubber) remain subdued. The Bank of England cuts rates one day later to match New York.
* Policy tools from the Federal Reserve are brand new; a few articles discuss how the discount rate, open market rate, and potential new “money markets” should operate. The Federal Reserve System formed 7.5 years ago.
* Several companies, such as Chevrolet and Rolls-Royce, mention price cuts on products and wage reductions. 
* Highlights in the newspapers this week reflect the growing unease of “forced liquidations” and terrible equity market trading conditions in New York, London, and Amsterdam. 
* German reparations are the single biggest factor moving the foreign exchange markets. Observers say for “several years”, the forex markets will express unnatural exchange rates. Under the Reparation Commission, Germany owes (in 2021 figures) billions of dollars to the UK and France. Prior reluctant and intermittent payments destroyed any concept of good faith. Whenever Germany sends partial payments to the Allied countries, these countries quickly convert German marks to US dollars in order to extinguish US dollar denominated WWI debt (the US emerged as the leading creditor nation after WWI). The currency table below shows incredible US dollar strength (the par value of the British pound sterling is $4.86, but spot is $3.58).
* In marked contrast to the broad economy, the farming industry exceeds 100% capacity; a few articles mention an unusually favorable climate so far this summer. One column notes how the value of farmland and real estate doubled from 1910 to 1920. Over the same period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat.
* Interesting article about Poland’s recent creation as a sovereign state and how the country raised debt as a way to supply itself in its fight against the Bolsheviks/Soviet Union (today known as the Polish-Soviet War). A US government official recently mocked Poland schlepping around its devalued currency in New York, and so this article functions as both a rebuttal and explanation of Poland’s intentions.
* There is a gossip column about an unusually large purchase of The Coca-Cola Company’s shares originating from a brokerage account in Asheville, NC. Purchases were recently made in early July right after Q2 ended, and word is that the company will deliver strong earnings in a few weeks. Based on the amounts listed, the company has a trailing PE ratio of 4 in 1921 (my own calculations).
   * **Historical Fact:** SEC insider trading rules don’t exist until the 1930s.

### Abstract

Cryptocurrencies are all the rage, but there is nothing new about privately produced money. The goal of private money is to be accepted at par with no questions asked. This did not occur during the Free Banking Era in the United States—a period that most resembles the current world of stablecoins. State-chartered banks in the Free Banking Era experienced panics, and their private monies made it very hard to transact because of fluctuating prices. That system was curtailed by the National Bank Act of 1863, which created a uniform national currency backed by U.S. Treasury bonds. Subsequent legislation taxed the state-chartered banks’ paper currencies out of existence in favor of a single sovereign currency. 

The newest type of private money is now upon us—in the form of stablecoins like “Tether” and Facebook’s “Diem” (formerly “Libra”). Based on lessons learned from history, we argue that privately produced monies are not an effective medium of exchange because they are not always accepted at par and are subject to runs. We present proposals to address the systemic risks created by stablecoins, including regulating stablecoin issuers as banks and issuing a central bank digital currency.",1626703864,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/onetie/taming_wildcat_stablecoins/

""WandaSA is currently undergoing extensive testing and validation at the new RGGI facility. We are very pleased with repeatability and accuracy of the system as a whole."" said Parsh Patel, CEO of Resgreen Group International. ""Using state-of-the-art technology, WandaSA is able to function autonomously. This allows for reduction in human exposure to UV-C and Ozone while ensuring effective and efficient elimination of 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses. It is a time and cost effective solution for companies looking to streamline their sanitization process.""

WandaSA uses LiDAR to create a scanned map of its environment, an Intel depth camera to create a 3D point cloud of objects in front of it, and IMU (inertial measurement unit) data to keep track of its location, navigate between points, and save locations. Once the routes are created, the robot moves autonomously along a path without requiring human interaction.

Utilizing the same 17""x17"" WandaSD size and body type allows WandaSA to navigate through smaller areas with ease. WandaSA is equipped with color and infrared sensors that create two viewable camera feeds. The Wanda App allows for the viewing of the map, the creation of routes by adding points along the way, and the ability to save location names.

RGGI is a leading developer of Artificial Intelligence Robotics (AIRs), Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), and Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs). RGGI's highly skilled engineers have years of experience in the material handling and robotics industries, which has led to significant intellectual property for the company.

RGGI also provides consulting services including backend operational oversight, material handling assessment, work-flow analysis, and steady state yield management using artificial intelligence, technology, and management systems.

43,investing,Kaawumba,Bonds vs Stocks and Short Term Returns: Now is the Time for Caution,"The goal here is to determine ideal bond vs stock allocation using current market conditions.

I previously addressed this issue here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds\_vs\_stocks\_and\_short\_term\_returns\_now\_is\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/meu01j/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_not/), and got feedback that I should look for a better leading indicator of future market returns, with the most helpful feedback from /u/jaghataikhan.

[https://alphaarchitect.com/2021/04/29/market-timing-using-aggregate-equity-allocation-signals/](https://alphaarchitect.com/2021/04/29/market-timing-using-aggregate-equity-allocation-signals/) did a comparative analysis, and found that Jesse Livermore's Average Investor Allocation to Equity (AIAE) has the best performance.

Briefly, AIAE is (Stocks Owned) / (Stocks + Bonds + Cash Owned) by the entire market. It can be thought of as a fear/greed indicator, where higher values are greedy and lower values are fearful. 

AIAE is discussed here:  [https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/](https://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/), and the raw data is available here:  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qis).

I did a comparative analyses between ECY and AIAE, and agree that AIAE has superior predictive power. That analysis is available here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TkVbfd32b\_SE6J8D7DuXFTJhOfBn4lOWEIZjTp\_u-\_w/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TkVbfd32b_SE6J8D7DuXFTJhOfBn4lOWEIZjTp_u-_w/edit?usp=sharing)

In the top row of charts, AIAE verse future nominal 10-year return is shown. This has an astounding R\^2 of 0.871, which means that 87.1% of the data is explained by this indicator. It is a bit lower than Jesse Livermore found, because of a different time window.

I use this line to get an expected 10-year nominal yield for each AIAE and subtract from this the 10-year nominal bond yield at that time to get an Excess AIAE Yield. This represents how much stocks are expected to beat bonds by for at a given time. I show this in the second row of charts, plotted in real dollars. The R\^2 has dropped a bit, to 0.768. This is lower, but still very good. Primarily, what this tells us is that AIAE does not predict the effect of inflation.

In the next row, I show an apples to apples comparison to Shiller's ECY, which has non-linear fit, and a lower still R\^2 value of 0.473.

I then repeated my back testing for the new parameter, which is in the Data tab of the google doc. AIAE related columns are shown in green, while CAPE related columns are in red. I found the highest return with the rule that stocks are more desirable than bonds if Excess AIAE Yield from 6 months ago &gt; 1.4%.

If I move a maximum of 1/12th of my portfolio each month (turning over the whole portfolio in a year) I get an annualized return of 9.11% from 1952 to 2011 for Excess AIAE Yield, compared to 8.20% for Shiller ECY, and 7.65% for stocks alone.

 

**Conclusions**

* In January, Excess AIAE Yield was -0.91%, which is significantly less than 1.4% so this indicator says that now is the time to switch to bonds (or deleverage). This contrast with Excess CAPE Yield, which still indicates about 1% of wiggle room before switching to bonds.
* It is rare to get a signal to switch to bonds, and the signal takes a long time to solidify, but that signal should not be ignored. If by waiting for some months to a year, you can save significantly on taxes, do so. These indicators do not move quickly and you can afford to be patient.

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* AIAE measures a natural level for stock vs bond ownership. This is not a fundamental parameter, with an underlying theory about why the natural level should be where it is, or will remain the same in the future.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* The data for the new parameter only goes back to 1945, and is low quality till 1952, while the Shiller data can be calculated back to 1871. This means you have to pick whether you'd like better correlation and higher back tests results or more data in deciding what to do.  


Finally, it will only take bond yields popping by 1% to bring these two indicators into agreement. I expect that to happen within a year. I also expect the market to peak within a year. These two assumptions are connected.",1626647549,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/on11bs/bonds_vs_stocks_and_short_term_returns_now_is_the/

49,investing,getpsychosocial,Letting AI Decide your Investments,"Hello  again!  Since my first post here a short time ago (about building a  small position in $GDRX), I wanted to raise another thought about one  strategy for optimizing long-term returns in a portfolio.  I recently  had discovered a fund called the AI Powered Equity ETF.  Most crucial to  know is that it is an actively managed fund, managed by none other than  the IBM Watson supercomputer!  For those who don't already know what  IBM Watson is, it is the supercomputer made most famous on the Jeopardy  show, which was the first ""contestant"" to beat Ken Jennings who had won  millions after remaining the contender for months.  Watson is used in  medical research and has been found to be able to diagnose cancer in patients prior to oncology teams.  It has a sophisticated set of  programs that allow it to comb through many terabytes of data in seconds, and then to use probability calculations to root out the most  likely solution/response/correct answer to a problem or data set it is  fed.  Here's an interesting article about recent performance of the AIEQ in trading momentum stocks that are not typically part of the ""meme  stock"" rallies.

Since one of my portfolios is through M1 Finance, I added a weighting to this  fund, essentially as a way to potentially hedge against volatility in QQQ and some Ark funds I DCA into weekly.  The position is relatively  low in the portfolio (&lt;10%).  While the returns aren't particularly  striking, I think this might be the strength of this fund overall.  I  believe Watson trades not to ""maximize"" returns, but rather to  ""optimize"" them.  Note I don't have any scientific evidence for this.   However, my suspicion is that Watson has an algorithm that uses trend discovery in momentum plays, to target optimizing for risk-adjusted  return.  Aka, ""How can I get you the best bang for the buck, while  simultaneously making your risk the absolute lowest I can?""  Would you  be open to a supercomputer trading for you for a somewhat higher fee?   Could AIEQ be one of the first actively managed funds to consistently  beat the S&amp;P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis, even in spite of its  expense ratio?  Do you think this could be an effective way of hedging  risk against the emotions of other human active managers, or as a  parachute for stocks that take a nosedive in a bear market?  Look forward to what you all think!",1626640280,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/omypgm/letting_ai_decide_your_investments/

36,investing,DarthTrader357,SPY - sell off or sideways. Thoughts,"So testing out (growing) into this Gamma Exposure concept (see: [spotgamma.com](https://spotgamma.com)) and what I gather from it is the market is now in a growing volatile state but that doesn't mean it'll sell up or down.

Rather, what I'm trying to do is look at where Gamma is positive because that's where Markets are supposed to have support and resistance (we will see how that prediction goes).

**And this band is for July 19 (Monday):**  
**Support: SPY @ 426**  
**Resistance: SPY @ 435**

So it could go either way, will get tent poled toward that direction, and we'll see if when it does if it pins to those positive gamma resistance/support levels.

I'm not trying to say it will move there within one day, but the day's direction will probably dictate how the week will trade.

Overall it looks like the SPY Gamma is very negative and we see a rising VIX so that seems to hold true.",1626592727,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/omlsir/spy_sell_off_or_sideways_thoughts/

55,investing,midasinvestors,Key Components to a Stock Analysis (an example stock pitch) - 7/17/2021," 

Hello investors,

It's been about a month since I last posted and there are a few updates that I wanted to share before I get down to today's memo.

1. I finally created an official mod account with user ID [u/midasinvestors](https://www.reddit.com/u/midasinvestors/). This will be the official mod account going forward.
2. I will be posting weekly memos again. I was settling into a new city and lots were happening in the past few weeks. Apologies for the lack of activity in the recent weeks.
3. Due to new compliance requirements by my new employer, I will be restrained in sharing/speaking to some of the topics. I appreciate everyone understanding that in advance.

With that said, let's get straight down to today's topic.

As a background, I have worked in investment banking and equity/credit research. When I was getting started, the best way I learned was by reading books like Peter Lynch's investing series, Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman, etc.

However, I've been increasingly noticing that a lot of people are leaving out some very important components to a stock analysis or taking big leaps in assumptions.

For instance, many people nowadays seem to be making premature conclusions along the lines of

""the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up"" or

""the real estate market in the US is very hot right now and it's a great time to buy a home"" or

""Amazon will report amazing quarterly earnings so the stock is a buy"".

And by the way, it's very natural and understandable why they make these kinds of arguments. In fact, it's human nature to think in this way.

The reason is that we have a cognitive bias called **""hindsight bias"".**

It basically means that people tend to believe they knew the results before they happened.

For example, when the Bucs won the Super Bowl last year, some claimed they knew it was inevitable.

Or some claim that they knew that the stock market would recover in less than a year.

Because of this strong belief that we already ""knew"" the results before they happened, we can also predict results going forward, which leads to a **confirmation bias** but I won't get into details in this memo.

**My point is that we need to be aware of all the cognitive biases affecting our decision-making because we all have them.** Some are more easily influenced by them than others.

The reason why I bring up these biases is that a stock analysis needs to contain a bias-free forecast.

I'll provide a sample pitch that I made a while back for illustration purposes (**for those who'd like a copy of this sample pitch, please add your email to the memo distribution list in \[deleted b/c it's considered a promotion\] forum and you'll receive a copy).**

📷

Now, I understand that some of you may be just getting started and I'm not saying you need to know the ins and outs of this one-pager.

I want to emphasize the three components to the analysis:

1. Investment Thesis
2. Valuation
3. Risks
4. Investment Thesis

Most people are aware of the first part. We know to invest in ""companies that produce things we are familiar with"" like Apple, Disney, Spotify, etc. But that's not enough of an investment thesis.

It's because what if a competitor comes out with a better product at a better price point? What if the industry dies in a matter of years (which can happen as evidenced by Blackberry, Xerox, iPods, etc.)? What if the management executes a terrible merger?

My point is that a thesis should explain why there is a **strong competitive advantage that's durable in the company.**

What's to keep Thor Industries the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles? Because it has the largest and most efficient manufacturing plants and largest dealership network in the world. There is a high barrier-to-entry for any new entrants to compete. Management has been known to be great capital allocators, meaning they know when to issue debt to build a new manufacturing plant, acquire a business, or buy back its own stock.

These points back up the claim that Thor has a durable competitive advantage and will keep the business growing.

2) Valuation

**Second part to a stock analysis is arguably the most important component: the valuation.**

All great investors argue your entry point is one of your biggest factors in making an investment decision.

Yes, the company's growth can explain the heightened valuation but when I hear that argument, I always point to this graph below.

📷

It took Microsoft 15 years to recover from its peak at the dot com bubble.

Now I know some of you will immediately argue back that this is not a dot com bubble but that's not the point I wanted to make.

I'm trying to say that leaving out a valuation analysis is like buying a house without knowing what the price is.

**""Amazon is a buy because it's got 1), 2), 3), etc."" without talking about its valuation is like saying ""this house is a buy because it's in a great location, newly remodeled, etc."" without saying how much it is selling for.**

Valuation can be represented in multiple ways. Here are some basic ratios to look at.

Growth companies: because they earn negative income, you should pay more attention to the growth story.

P/S, EV/S (enterprise value to sales), P/Gross profit, PEG (PE to growth ratio)

Mature companies: because they have peaked in their growth cycle, they have consistent cash flows

EV/EBITDA, P/E, EV/FCF (free cash flow)

Next step is to assess whether these ratios are reasonable.

Going back to the real estate example, if you knew the house you were looking at is priced at $1.5 million, that doesn't really tell you anything.

You need to look at how much rent you can charge the house for, what nearby houses are selling at, and recent transactions in the neighborhood.

Similarly, you need to look at the P/S ratios and gross profit margins of competitors in the same industry to see if your computed numbers line up well.

If Thor is trading at 15x PE ratio, it may sound cheap but when you realize that its competitors are trading at 8x PE ratio, you know that it's overvalued compared to its peers.

You need to figure out why your company is overvalued/undervalued compared to its peers and whether it's justified. If it is undervalued for no good reason, such as there is a CFO scandal, then it could be a good opportunity.

3) Risks

This is also one of the most overlooked component to a stock analysis.

In any investment, there are risks. The simple reason is that nothing is ""guaranteed"" in the world.

Are you guaranteed to be healthy tomorrow? No, but the chances are, you are much more likely to be healthy than sick.

Is Amazon guaranteed to go up in the next 5 years? No, but chances are high.

**Your role as an analyst is to increase your odds in your bet.**

The more analysis you do, the more you eliminate the risks of making a bad investment.

To summarize today's memo, I strongly encourage you to approach a stock analysis from a multi-dimensional level.

Don't buy a house just because it's newly built, or it's in a great location, or your rental incomes are high.

Buy it because the price doesn't reflect the upcoming developments in the neighborhood that'll result in home price appreciation, or because your house is undervalued compared to recent houses that sold in the nearby area, or because the house has an opportunity for price appreciation through minor renovations.

82,investing,folkwoodswest,"Why I Believe CureVac $CVAC is a Solid Long-term Investment [Their work includes rabies vaccines, lassa/yellow fever vaccines, Respirational syncytial virus vaccine, Other infectious diseases vaccines, Rota, malaria, universal influenza vaccines, Cutaneous melanoma cures, and much more...]","CureVac N.V. is a German biopharmaceutical company that develops therapies based on messenger RNA. Legally domiciled in the Netherlands and headquartered in Tübingen, Germany, the company was founded in 2000 by Ingmar Hoerr, Steve Pascolo, Florian von der Mulbe, Günther Jung, and Hans-Georg Rammensee.

CureVac reached $120.43 in February per share and was battered upon news their COVID vaccine was 48% effective against all COVID variants (77% efficacy in preventing moderate to serious illness and 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization or death -- among participants ages 18 to 60.)

However, what most fail to realize is the COVID vaccine is a small part of their product pipeline/portfolio.

The German government has invested more than 300 million euros into CureVac.

CureVac has both appointed a new COO and that one of the company’s cofounders has resigned from the board to focus full-time on improving the manufacturing process for its RNA vaccines.

CureVac has received funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

The company's focus is on developing vaccines for infectious diseases and drugs to treat cancer and rare diseases. CureVac has entered into various collaborations with organizations, including agreements with [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehringer_Ingelheim), [Sanofi Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi_Pasteur), [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_%26_Johnson), [Genmab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genmab), the [Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation), [Eli Lilly and Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company), [GlaxoSmithKline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline), [Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_Epidemic_Preparedness_Innovations), the [International AIDS Vaccine Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_AIDS_Vaccine_Initiative), and the [government of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Germany)

In October 2013 CureVac launched a collaboration with [Janssen Pharmaceuticals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janssen_Pharmaceuticals) Inc., a [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_%26_Johnson) company, for the development of novel flu vaccines. Also in 2013, CureVac announced the fourth in a series of partnerships with the [Cancer Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Research_Institute) and [Ludwig Cancer Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Cancer_Research) to enable clinical testing of novel cancer immunotherapy treatment options.

In March 2014, CureVac won a €2 million prize awarded by the European Commission to stimulate new vaccine technologies. Later, in July 2014, CureVac signed an exclusive license agreement with [Sanofi Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi_Pasteur) to develop and commercialize an mRNA-based prophylactic vaccine. By September 2014, the company licensed the global rights for its Phase I candidate – CV9202 – to [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehringer_Ingelheim). Boehringer was to conduct trials using the [mRNA vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA_vaccine) in combination with [afatinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afatinib) in advanced and/or metastatic [epidermal growth factor receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor) (EGFR) mutated [non-small cell lung cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small_cell_lung_cancer) (NSCLC) as well as inoperable stage III NSCLC.

In March 2015, a CureVac investor, the [Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation), agreed to provide separate funding for several projects to develop prophylactic vaccines based on CureVac's proprietary mRNA platform. By September 2015, CureVac entered into a collaboration with the [International AIDS Vaccine Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_AIDS_Vaccine_Initiative) (IAVI) to accelerate the development of AIDS vaccines, utilizing immunogens developed by IAVI and partners, delivered via CureVac's mRNA technology. That same month, CureVac announced it would open a United States hub in [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston), [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts).

In accordance with its deal with Lilly, the company began construction on a production facility in 2016.

I know the COVID vaccine was a huge letdown ... but the hit the stock took was way too extreme for a 21-year-old company that now has the sturdy research bones necessary to continue building healing vaccines well into the future. Their RNA printer is now ready to start new trials and they have so much more in the pipeline (rabies vaccines, lassa/yellow fever vaccines, Respirational syncytial virus vaccine, Other infectious diseases vaccines, Rota, malaria, universal influenza vaccines, Cutaneous melanoma cures, adenoidcystic carcinoma cures, squamous cell cancer of skin, head and neck cures, Non-small cell lung cancer cures, Tumor associated antigens (TAA) cures, Shared neo-antigens, Cas9 gene-editing, Ocular diseases, Lung respiratory diseases, Therapeutic antibodies).

This is a $10+ billion company that has a fantastic future ahead of it for long-term investors. Short term, they suffered a blow, but the ding their stock took was way too large.

92,investing,cr0ne,"What are your under-appreciated, off-the-radar picks for a 10 year hold?","Show me names that are generally off the radar or at least not usually discussed here.

* I mostly hold blue-chips but they are already on everyone’s radar. I don’t need to hear for the millionth time that  “GE is going to sell a bunch of electric ovens” or that a China cold war is going to help defense stocks. Give me a thesis I haven’t heard before if you’re throwing out a blue chip.
* Please don’t throw out something like PLUG. Maybe it is out-of-favor with its recent beat-down but there are already a billion posts already on them. 
* No 	bio-tech please unless you actually have a bull/bear case for the 	science.
* Under-appreciated	does not need to mean “low-PE”, I’m looking for companies that are investing in the future and ideally doing something that provides value to society, not “oh gee, this private 	prison company is trading with a 14% dividend”  (yes, CXW is a thing).

What I want is something that is **currently not in favor** but has potential to do well on a 10 year time frame. Why 10 years? The idea of “efficient market hypothesis” is misunderstood. It’s really “average weighted market participant”, and guess what...every market participant is in the game for a different reason. Some folks are in it for the YOLO, some are just trying to keep up with inflation, and most (asset managers) are simply trying to earn a good end-of-year bonus. I don’t have a chance in hell beating the market on **their time-frame**, but I think I have a good shot of beating it on **my time-frame** if I buy and hold solid companies with patience on my side.

Fundamental DD isn’t what I’m looking for, I assume the market has already priced that in. **Tell me what the market isn’t pricing in**. Also give me the bear case. I’ll start this off with the most eccentric stuff in my book...

**Alleghany Corp (Y)**

I just really love the management of this re-insurance company. They don’t “play Warren Buffet” and invest in the stock market. Instead they invest in private companies, with an eye towards durable moats...companies that can’t easily lose their position to Amazon or foreign competitors. Investments include AFCO Steel LLC (steel erection) &amp; Jazware Toys (maker of Pokemon &amp; AEW action figures). This is the management team that had the foresight to buy a private **FUNERAL** company while the corona-virus epidemic was raging.

Bull: COVID &amp; severe weather (winter storm) losses really took it’s toll on the industry. Alleghany and others took significant underwriting losses. I see this as a positive going forward, because demand and pricing-power on re-insurance is likely be in an uptrend for the foreseeable future especially as severe climate events become the norm.  

Bear: Climate change is a double-edged sword. More frequent severe weather is a good thing, because that improves demand/pricing-power...but the risk of massive black-swan event is always there.

**Restaurant Brands International (QSR)**

I nearly decided not to include this as they are a blue-chip, but mutual funds and asset managers HATE QSR. Their financials are uninspiring and generally they have a reputation on the street for “not being well-managed.” My take is that management is playing the long game rather than focusing on keeping the analysts happy...

Bull: If you’ve ever walked around Wall St., one thing is for certain...those managers have not eaten in one of those restaurants in years. Asset managers are in love with YUM Brands’ margin expansion yet ignoring that their food quality is going down the tubes. Meanwhile QSR has been playing the opposite game, stepping up their quality in Burger King and Tim Horton’s especially. The market is also under-appreciating the global expansion potential of Popeyes and Burger King. Indians love the veggie burger, and China loves fried chicken. Global expansion was put on hold due to corona-virus but is going to resume.

Bear: Tim Hortons. Their quality has vastly improved but brand-damage already took its toll, will take years to repair the reputation. Work-from-home conditions are going to hurt this line-of-business for the foreseeable future.

**Freyr (FREY)**

Bull: Not just another lithium-ion SPAC. This one is out of Norway and even had a show of support from Erna Solberg (Norwegian prime minister). Energy is cheap there thanks to wind/hydro and  Freyr provides a rare opportunity for Norwegians to get a job at a promising upstart.

Bear: This is the biggest risk on my book. They are literally starting from scratch. No manufacturing capability expected for several years. They are currently hiring w/ the funds from their IPO. My main thesis is that Norwegians don’t generally pull pump-and-dump schemes like in the US. This can grow big or go to $0 if mismanaged.

**Ingridions (INGR)**

Bull:  While everyone is distracted with Beyond Meat, industry dinosaur INGR has been not-so-secretly pivoting towards plant protein manufacturing. Just recently they’ve opened the first US plant that focuses exclusively on plant-based protein isolates and teaming with Clara Foods on egg protein alternatives. They’re plant-protein investments are expected to continue accelerating with nearly $200 million in investments planned.

Bear: High-fructose corn syrup. While the company has been diversifying their portfolio to include stevia, starches, and beer brewing ingredients, HFCS is still a major part of their business, and it continues to get a bad rep despite that Ingridion’s corn syrup is likely more environmentally sustainable than cane sugar. Ingridion has not been able to win the perception war on HFCS and will need to keep finding new revenue streams to make up for stale demand in sweeteners.

**NiSource, Inc (NI)**

Bull: Renewable energy investments are their biggest growth driver. While green energy eyes are focusing on cars, folks don’t realize **utility** **workers** are going to be the muscle behind the energy revolution. I’m looking towards a near-future where the political atmosphere recognizes this and accordingly green-lights the investments that are going to need to be made.

Their business model is also very resilient...this is a company that literally blew up 80 homes in Massachusetts, survived the lawsuit and ended with a stronger all-time high a year later. Currently trading (along many other utilities) at way below their pre-corona highs despite a near record-high spread between their dividend and treasury yield.

Bear: It’s a regulated utility company. Political constraints are going to cap their upward potential.

**IAMGold (IAG)**

Bull: Their stock has been beaten down after something like eight years of red tape, and now they’ve finally broken ground on their Cote Mine in Quebec. I had to pay attention because Justin Trudeau himself attending the ground-breaking ceremony. Company has practically zero debt and a price to book of around 0.6. They are literally worth more than the gold they are sitting on. I don’t think gold bugs realize the benefit of having a mine in Canada. If gold ever does reach $3000, good luck getting it out of a 3rd world country without paying bribes.

Bear: This company needs a strong gold price. Canadian labor is expensive: gold needs to fetch a good price to make mining profitable. A lot is riding on Cote and there’s always the risk it could end up a bust.

**Cal Maine Foods (CALM)**

Bull: Eggs are currently selling at near inflation adjusted lows (measured over 30+ years). It’s practically never been cheaper to eat eggs, while per-capita consumption is on uptrend. Sooner or later the hope is that margins will improve, especially as demand for cage free increases. Cal-Maine is currently trading with a depressed price yet very high PE due to continued investment in growth, especially cage-free (these sell at larger margins). I see this as an investment that will pay off in 5+ years.

Bear: Literally all you need to compete with them is to buy a rooster and some hens. Egg industry pricing power remains weak.

**Graftech (EAF)**

I’m usually not into very cheap but this company is very cheap. 7 PE. EAF is a Brookfield turnaround story. It’s understood that they were mismanaged before Brookfield came in, cleaned things up, and improved efficiency/margins. Stock has been a bear since Brookfield IPO’d it, as it’s obvious the purpose of the IPO is just so that Brookfield could cash in on their original investment. BIG insider selling by Brookfield has not finished yet and it remains an anchor around the stock price. Fortunately however Brookfield has already trimmed down to own &lt; 25% of the company...so there’s a bit more to go but the insider selling drag is likely to be over soon.

Bull: The steel industry is responsible for roughly 5% of all global carbon emissions. There’s currently no other way to produce low-carbon steel other than recycling steel scrap. EAF is the largest US manufacturer of graphite electrodes: the heating element used in the furnace to melt down and recycle steel. Right now there isn’t any political “push” to increase recycled steel demand, and “made in USA” has so far been an empty promise, but I expect real political push for both will come in a few years.

Bear: China. Industry speculation is that China is building up several times the capacity to build graphite electrodes...although speculation is also that quality will not be a good. It remains to be seen if Chinese firms are doing this for domestic consumption only (China wants to go green too). It also remains to be seen if Chinese output will be able to keep up with or exceed recycled steel demand.",1626544590,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/om9772/what_are_your_underappreciated_offtheradar_picks/
7,investing,cefpodoxime,FT: ‘Strange’ bond reaction to US inflation data puzzles investors,"https://amp.ft.com/content/26f6be41-61b7-4db8-b190-90a1f26c1424

A relentless rally in US Treasuries has accompanied the biggest burst of inflation in more than a decade, snapping typically reliable patterns and leaving investors scrambling for an explanation for what is going on in the world’s largest bond market.

Inflation is typically bad news for bond prices, eroding the value of the fixed payments the debt offers and making it more likely that central banks will respond with interest rate rises.

But recent months have turned that relationship on its head, at least for longer-dated debt. US Treasuries prices have run up big gains — with other bonds around the world following in their wake — pulling the 10-year yield to its lowest in more than three months this week just under 1.3 per cent, down from 1.75 per cent at the end of March.

“There’s a lot of head scratching going on,” said Mike Riddell, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors. “On the face of it this move looks pretty counterintuitive.”

Investors have homed in on recent signalling from the Federal Reserve about its evolving sensitivity to elevated inflation as one explanation for the seemingly unstoppable rally in government bonds. Wall Street was put on high alert in June following the release of the Fed’s “dot plot” of policymakers’ interest rate projections. That suggested the possibility of a much swifter tightening of monetary policy than initially indicated when the Fed last year embraced an average 2 per cent inflation target that would include periods of overshooting. 

Jay Powell, the Fed chair, has discouraged market participants from reading too much into these individual forecasts and urged patience about the eventual removal of policy support. But he has also acknowledged the risk that the Fed may need to respond to higher-than-anticipated price pressures. 

“We are experiencing a big uptick in inflation — bigger than many expected and bigger certainly than I expected — and we are trying to understand whether it is something that will pass through fairly quickly or whether if in fact we need to act,” he said at a congressional hearing on Thursday.

“One way or the other, we are not going to be going into a period of high inflation for a long period of time, because of course we have tools to address that. But we don’t want to use them in a way that is unnecessary or that interrupts the rebound of the economy.”

Taken together with the recent admission that Fed officials are beginning discussions on the scaling back $120bn monthly purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities, this shift in stance has convinced many investors that the Fed will be less tolerant of runaway inflation expectations than previously thought.

“The Fed has effectively removed some of the more extreme scenarios the market was worrying about,” said James Athey, a bond fund manager at Abrdn. “The more that rate hike expectations are baked in, the less inflation is expected to run out of control.”

Rising coronavirus cases linked to the more transmissible Delta variant have also renewed fears that the economic boom tied to the reopening of large swaths of the global economy will fall short of the extremely optimistic forecasts put forward by economists earlier in the year. But with equity markets buoyant around record highs, investors are reluctant to conclude that the bond market — a magnet in times of stress — is signalling a newly grim outlook for the global economy.

Instead, many continue to point to investor positioning — a familiar culprit for the Treasury market’s gyrations since June’s Fed meeting. In the first quarter of the year as investors prepared for the reopening of the US economy and the return of inflation, they bet heavily on higher long-term yields, while also wagering that the Fed would keep short-term yields pinned down. Many of the subsequent moves can be explained by investors ditching those so-called steepener trades — often reluctantly — as markets moved against them and losses mounted.

“None of the grand narratives to explain this rally works for the whole of the last few months,” said Riddell. “That’s why I think it makes sense to talk about positioning.”

Despite a series of setbacks, some are sticking with the steepener trade, arguing that the apparent contradiction between soaring inflation and plunging bond yields is unlikely to last. At some point, the Fed will be forced to back away from its view that the current bout of inflation will prove mostly transitory, jolting the bond market as investors prepare for a more rapid wind-down of stimulus, according to Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of BlueBay Asset Management.

“Bonds should be naturally allergic in their reaction to inflation,” Dowding said. “We suspect that we may look back at the current period in markets some time later in the year and view some of the trends we are witnessing as relatively strange.”",1626539454,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/om7k2e/ft_strange_bond_reaction_to_us_inflation_data/
19,investing,Promenad_Investing,Promenad - a different approach,"Promenad is a new and constantly evolving online dating app. But how does it differ from the usual applications? The answer is very simple. We offer for free most of the basic features that rival apps sell. New users of Promenad can view an unlimited number of profiles, see who visits their page, and who likes their profile, all for free. Selling such simple and very important features negatively affects the audience retention. Although there is a limit of three likes per day in the Promenad, but thanks to ability to see those who like you, these likes can be used wisely.

Our team wants the application to be simple, convenient and, most importantly, interesting to use. A very visible element of Promenad design involves a departure from the ""swiping"" that is increasingly out of fashion in the world of online dating. Promenad features a horizontal browser smart feed. While it looks similar to swipes, the interface allows users to quickly return to the previous profile and immediately view it entirely, including the ability to flip through photos. The like buttons have been lowered to the bottom so that the user can view the entire profile before sending a hello.

Our co-founder Maxim Shcheglov is convinced that such a concept will be more attractive to users. They will be much more interested in flipping through the feed, and they will not be tired of the monotony, as in the usual applications. User reviews of the design only reinforce our convictions. Like any promising app, Promenad plans to evolve and add more and more features. In the future, there will be a section with mini-apps. The developers of Promenade are constantly testing and coming up with new options, such as mini-games, so that at any time user can distract from the search for their soulmate and relax.

The currency in our app will work not only for dating, but also for mini-apps and mini-games. In the future, we will add new geolocation features, such as an interactive map of interesting places with user ratings, which will make it easier to choose before a meeting and help people find common interests.

Our target audience is users over the age of 30, they are more selective and financially secure, but Promenad is created with all age groups in mind. «Our mission is to introduce as many people as possible to each other», says Shcheglov. «The creation of social ties contributes to the development of society. This is a fact.»

To carefully grow our user base, Promenad leverages well curated partner marketing and targets highly active customer acquisition channels for immediate results, providing a predictable flow of energized and interactive new members. We are then able to test new features with new audiences for timely feedback, always keeping the app fresh.

At the same time, our algorithms that underlie the user interface are constantly learning and adapting to the user's interests. Thus, the AI quickly understands what exactly a person is looking for in our application, whether it is «deliberate dating» or a more serious relationship. Thanks to such mechanisms, we will be able to calculate customers who will invest money in specific functions.

Enterprise technology is critical. We create and use a state-of-the-art technology stack, because our main operational goal is to achieve and maintain flexibility in the development and scaling of Promenad.",1626530186,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/om4q1q/promenad_a_different_approach/

They have a limited time promotion going on right now: Register an account with the link below and get 2 stocks worth up to $2300.

For the first stock, you don't need to do anything. Just create an account. To claim the second stock, you need to deposit $5 into the account. Once funds are settled, you can claim the stock.

If you're not interested in investing, i'd still recommend signing up just for the cash. You don't even have to use their app, you can just sell whatever stocks you get from the promotion when the stock market is open during the week and transfer the money back to your account. And then spend with whatever you want, or transfer the money to your brokerage of choice.

38,investing,DarthTrader357,"Determining real bottoms and tops, and near-term price action","I did a lot of work already on a different post. The only reason I am posting the link is I cannot embed pictures in this community. But I'd love to hear from the investor community on what they think of the work.

For me this is Due Diligence. This is how I want to determine good entries, good exits, and build (accumulate) my long term holdings.

I grew tired of watching most of my portfolio yo-yo around and having learned more about Gamma in options trading I decided to apply it to my two most tracked stocks and see if it helped put the pieces together on why they behaved the way they did.

Sure enough. Gamma Exposure seems to completely explain why MSFT is trading in a lower volatile range right now, and why JPM is a yo-yo.

Further more it demonstrates where the big money has hedged their bets on where the price will be by end of next week. Depending on what the price is, delta-hedging can force that price across the finish line into a new strike price, or to add profits to the existing intrinsic value, or prevent total loss.

MSFT was a near equal battle between Calls and Puts while Long Gamma so their behavior **pinned** the stock.

Meanwhile JPM was well out of the money from where most open interest Calls were positioned and as a result they didn't even try to influence the price. Put-open-interest tent-pegged the stock into the ground for maximum profits in what is called a **Gamma Trap**.  


This type of analysis, I think, is an icing on the cake to simply help your entry or your exit after other considerations such as fundamentals, long term strategies, and if the stock is higher or lower risk.

Let me know what you all think:

45,investing,cr0ne,Beating the market...what Bogleheads have wrong,"The core tenet of Boglehead philosophy is  to buy and hold passive mutual funds, and you’ll get rich slowly. Of course this assumes the market in aggregate will keep going up. Bogleheads consider it as fact: of course it will go up over 10+ years, certainly over 20+ years. For as much as this community love Vanguard ETFs they sure like to ignore this line in their prospectus: “Past performance is no guarantee of future results.”

Okay...so maybe we all have to HOPE that markets will go up over a 20 year time frame otherwise we all are going to have a hard time. But how hard is it to beat the market?  

Turns out fewer than 5% of mutual funds can outperform the S&amp;P 500 over 10 years. There’s lots of stats on this, but not much into the “why”. No, the story you heard that a monkey flipping a coin is better than your Ivy league educated asset manager is untrue. The truth is uglier. The market is RIGGED against continued out-performance of good managers. Let’s see the reasons why:

&amp;#x200B;

* Managers are rarely rewarded for sticking it out on undervalued companies that won’t catalyze earnings for several years. This doesn’t help their end-of-year bonus, and it can cost them their 	jobs. The one-year performance target is like an anchor around their neck.  
 
* Successful funds become victim of their own success. Funds that have grown too large cannot easily unload their positions, especially if they end up owning a substantial % of small crowded holdings.  	  
 
* Dirty secret of the fund industry: many managers are so scared of under-performing their benchmark that that they’ll hold certain momentum stocks at weight and seek their alpha else-where. Look at Vanguard Primecap Fund (pretty much Vanguard’s star growth active fund). Pay attention and you’ll notice they hold \~2% of their AUM in Tesla, nearly always tracking the same amount held in their benchmark Growth index. I can’t speak for that manager directly but many managers FEAR that not holding Tesla (or whatever momentum story of the day) at index-weight may impact their end-of-year comp. This leads into the next point…  
 
* Inflows and outflows then come at the worst possible times, forcing managers to buy into their style index when it’s most expensive &amp; sell cheap. This makes it nearly impossible to beat the style-neutral S&amp;P 500 consistently.  
 
* Fees! (okay – Bogleheads win on this one)  
 

Can we all agree that 99% of people on reddit do not have the problems above? We can invest for 10+ year time-frames if we have the patience. If we’re in an IRA we can literally dump 100% of our holdings and start-anew with different holdings.  We aren't beholden to a benchmark.

Maybe VTI is where to be for the next 20 years. Maybe Apple will continue it’s march to 50 PE. Neither would surprise me. The US Stock Market has moved away from being a vehicle to help companies raise capital and instead has turned into a too-big-to-fail pension fund for the US population.

I'm at the point now though where I’m no longer willing to bet that markets only go up. If you're in the same boat, you either have to learn how to navigate markets or you need to find a good benchmark free manager (good luck).

48,investing,ThenIJizzedInMyPants,Q for discussion: Simply buying and rebalancing/updating the top 30 year performers,"Some of you may have seen tables like [this one](https://imgur.com/a/9yY4C35), showing the best long term compounders over the past 20-30+ years.  It's a pretty diverse set of companies.  

A thought that occurred to me:  Why not simply buy a basket (20-30) of the best long term compounders, and rebalance/update annually?  I've never seen a backtest of this strategy so I'm curious if anyone here has, or has access to long term data to run such a backtest.

My reasoning is simple.  By looking at the best performing stocks over the past 20-30 years, you select for:

1)  Companies that have been able to survive for a long time and prosper

2)  Companies that can adapt and thrive over decades and return capital to shareholders efficiently.  

To go more in depth, some of you may be familiar with empirical asset pricing literature.  In the literature, there are 3 recognized statistical effects that occur at different time periods:

* Short term reversal (1 month time horizon, the strongest/weakest performers tend to reverse in the subsequent month)

* Medium term momentum (6-12 month time horizon, the strongest/weakest performers tend to continue for another 1 month)

* Long term reversal (over 5-10 years, the strongest/weakest performers tend to reverse in the subsequent few months or even years)

I can share the papers if anyone's interested.  The point is that apparently no one has studied the forward performance of very long term outperformers.  Now there's a good reason for this, because at that long time range, the sample set of companies and length of time available is pretty small.  Still, thinking from first principles, I'd be interested in investigating this sort of strategy further but don't have access to long term stock data (back to 1926 for example).

Checking options expiration to avoid gamma explosions against the trend.

Carbon capture. Read ahead if you want to see my anecdotes of why I think this is a severe issue.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Energy-and-innovation/Carbon-capture-and-storage](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Energy-and-innovation/Carbon-capture-and-storage)

XOM's strategy perplexed me when I first noticed it. I thought ""Carbon Capture? That's a dead-end.""

Without giving too much explanation of my background which revolves around strategy military analysis...let's just say I'm incredibly bearish on the survival of humanity in the next 50 to 100 years. Mostly because the arctic is already wiping out any hope humanity has to prevent a catastrophic climate event that causes half the world to take their nukes and make Lebensraum for themselves in the other half of the planet less impacted.

So needless to say - I think climate change has profound geopolitical impacts.  
Some examples

* About half of China's GDP is within 30 feet of sea level.
* About 70 of US's nuclear reactors are within 10 feet of sea level and many are already having to take emergency measures to prevent current flooding that wasn't happening when they were built

Blah blah blah.  


Here's my point....it makes sense why XOM chose to invest in carbon capture.

Because we have no hope of reducing carbon emissions to stop catastrophic climate change. **WE HAVE TO SEQUESTER CARBON**.

And Exxon in particular has been hammered legally for not telling shareholders what it really thinks about fossil fuel's contribution to climate change.

65,investing,DarthTrader357,Pinning a stock and Gamma Explosion," 

I tend to save posts like this for another subreddit, but this one is pretty well researched and understood and so today we see some real world examples of this in MSFT and JPM.

So it looks like both MSFT and JPM got pinned today - and consequently JPM was **Gamma Exploded**.

[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/how-options-expiration-affects-stock-prices-11346823](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/how-options-expiration-affects-stock-prices-11346823)

Pinning is when institutions close to in-the-money on their options try to manipulate the price to stay above or below the strike price they need.

On a lower volume day like today it seems the expiration of **MONTHLY** options this week really pinned the MSFT and JPM prices that I have been tracking.

And since most of the open interest **CALLS** for JPM was way too high (\~$160 strike) I think they basically didn't even try, or delta-hedged by shorting JPM, and that really hammered the price. (**Gamma explosion)**

Since Banks trade similarly, all the banks behaved similar to this way and probably for similar reasons.

Because of this, and because the **INERTIA** for JPM remains bullish...I think Banks will make a much stronger roar back toward $160 (JPM) or a nearly 6% move this next 2 to 3 weeks before the next major pinning probably next monthly's expiration.

Because the **INERTIA** for MSFT is bearish, this pinning to the strike price probably shows that MSFT's bull run is finally dead. I've had a historical frustration with MSFT making a fool of me calling it dead, but at last it just could not rally against the options-play. As such, the price's pin reveals a very weak hand for the weeks ahead.

I'm suspecting the expiration of options forced the price moves which were within their expected moves. Ironically, it appears, that open interest in the case of JPM was JUST outside the money for both calls and puts for where the most open interest was. **EVERYONE** had to delta hedge. (If my understanding is correct). So the result is a low-volume day mixed with a lot of people forced to cover their expiry's

77,investing,waynetr,A Simple Reason Why The Wheels Are Falling Off (Major Correction Incoming)," The Rich are not spending enough and are investing most of their wealth into assets. Return on assets is generated by the middle-to-lower class spending, which has been propped up by stimulus checks. Take the stimulus checks away and there is a void. The wheels are falling off and if nothing changes, we could see a major correction even with low interest rates and asset purchases.   


The only way to stop a major correction in the short-term is to keep doling out stimulus checks - not infrastructure spending but stimulus checks to the middle-to-low class.  


Solving this problem on a longer-term basis would include a lot of the policies the Liberals are pushing - Increasing capital gains tax on the wealthiest, reducing the pay gap within companies etc.  


More importantly, as the wealth inequality continues to accelerate during the Pandemic, societal stability is no longer a granted and the idea of capitalism is being tested here. It seems that many youths no longer trust capitalism, but I believe it's the best system for well-rounded prosperity in the 21st century.

78,investing,chizbejoe,Why investing in $CRTD is a no-brainer at this price (Squeeze inbound),"**The Rundown (sources at the bottom):**

* 49.72% Short Interest
* Now the #1 most shorted stock (Not sure why [highintereststocks.com](https://highintereststocks.com/) has yet to list it. If someone knows, let me know)
* $38mil - $50mil market cap (For reference, GME and AMC are both in the billions)
* Closed today at $3.18

**Here's why I bought the dip today:**

The fact that it's now the #1 most shorted stock will certainly draw attention from the media and retail investors. If it was #4 or #5, I would be more on the fence. But being #1 comes with a spotlight.

Moreover, its very low price is also enticing to retail investors and its low market cap allows for immense volatility. We've seen how it's gone from roughly $3 to $7 in a single day. And now, it's currently trading at $3.18.

Considering that CRTD has a floor around $2.50 - $3 that it has pretty much never fallen through, it is a safe bet to buy in around this price. Then, factor in that it's the #1 most shorted stock and has a very low market cap, and you have what amounts to a short squeeze (a.k.a. the next CARV). All we need is some volume. That's why I'm here.

The company is obviously young and not profitable, hence why it is shorted. So there are, of course, some concerns that they could go under and investors would lose their entire investment. They acknowledge this in the most recent [10-K report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001357671/000121390021018972/f10k2020_creatdinc.htm), but they also explain that they expect to ""have adequate financing for the next 12 months."" And with the [recent press release](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/creatd-inc.-hits-key-milestone-of-over-30000-vocal-subscribers-and-confirms-revenue) that touts an increase in revenue and a decrease in costs, they are not going under anytime soon (""soon"" meaning within the next month, at least, which is all the time we need for a squeeze anyway).

I am not an expert. I am not a financial adviser. But too many things are lining up for this shit to pop, and with how low the price is, y'all can make bank.

I ain't no bullshit artist, so let me know if any of this information is incorrect. I appreciate the advice.

 I know it's silly, but bear with me for a bit and confirm me a couple of questions.

- Where do I get the value of revenue from? (the P&amp;L statement, top line?)
- EBIT? (From the Statement of Cash Floes(SCF), top line or the P&amp;L statement?)
- Value of interest and taxes payed? (P&amp;L, financing costs note or from the SCF, financing cash flows? Usually the values are different depending where you look)

28,investing,PaulP97,Semiconductor Stocks- Boom or Bust?,"As we all know, there’s a global chip shortage, and demand is at an all time high. That’s good for semiconductor stocks right? Yes, but also in my opinion, maybe not.

Why you ask? Well the fact that there is a shortage, literally means that there is a supply issue. They can’t keep up with the demand. 

As a result, semiconductor stocks must be booming right? Right, but now that so many investors have come to the same conclusion, they rush to these semiconductor stocks, pumping the price up. Good for everyone who owns shares.

Now here comes the issue- whenever a company grows, their P/E ratio naturally grows as well as it is directly tied to the company’s earnings. If the P/E ratio of a stock goes up, the earnings need to follow or else it doesn’t warrant for the additional price growth.

Now here is where we bring the discussion back to the problem at hand- chip shortage.

With there being a shortage of chips, semiconductor companies are unable to keep up with the demand, essentially bottleneck into the companies earnings growth. You can’t keep growing and producing more revenue if you can’t produce inventory fast enough to keep up with the demand, meaning the companies earnings won’t be able to grow at the same rate as the share price, proving those price levels to be unsustainable, resulting in a drop in share price.

THIS IS MY OPINION/THEORY, FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION BELOW

tldr; chip shortage means semiconductors can’t produce enough chips for the current demand, meaning their revenue can’t grow to sustain the growth of the share price- post  your thoughts",1626451829,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oljzbt/semiconductor_stocks_boom_or_bust/

Couple of points: 
-the cash would need to be almost instantly accessible (maybe a few days of turnaround is acceptable). Meaning no CDs and that kind of useless products.
-What matters is at least to keep up with inflation and make a little extra is bonus
-Obviously less risk is the target

I thought about a couple of options. I would love to get your thoughts on them and any other ideas that are less known maybe?

- Invest in a crypto stable coin. I know it's a bit the far west but, you can make 7% on a crypto that is pegged to the dollar.
I understand there is more risk but I could do a startegy 50/50 between that and a savings account. That would gross 3.5% on the total with a risk of loss of 50% max (if the crypto disappear for whatever reason. To mitigate this risk I'd prefer a stable coin issued by a renowned US company (Gemini comes to mind)
-Invest in a high paying dividend fund that has a relatively stable price (QYLD comes to mind but maybe there are better solution). With a roughly 10% annual div, it seems fine. This solution is a bit more dependent on the stock's valuation and bad timing could be bad.

72,investing,valuescott,Best Buy company research,"## Company Summary

Best buy is an international consumer electronic retailer that operates through physical and online stores.  They were incorporated in Minnesota in 1966.  They specialize in selling computers, mobile devices, televisions, cameras, wearables, audio products, and home appliances.  They have 1,126 large format stores, 33 small format stores and employ approximately 100 thousand people. They have a market cap of a little over 27.5 Billion.

**Management overview:**

Corie Barry (CEO): She has a 21 year history with best buy.  Before that her only employment was two years at deloitte. 91% of employees approve of the CEO

The general sentiment from glassdoor is that management listens and employees are treated well.  Even the worst reviews generally approve of management.  It looks like there are different opinions from store to store. Some of the better ones say that there is a lot of support from other employees, while the worst ones say that other employees are rude.  There is talk among many reviews that long hours standing up gets very exhausting after being employed for long periods.  

## Addressable Market

Best buy’s target market is most retail users looking for non specific or generic electronics.  They can offer customized products, but lack a competitive advantage to the manufacturers as manufacturers often offer cheaper prices if you customize and order a product online.

## Risk

There are a number of risks associated with the industry.  Before listing out some of the risks identified by best buy itself.

The nature of the electronics industry is very competitive.  Even if best buy can acquire products with volume discounts, they should still be expected to have lower margins than the manufacturer as long as best buy implements its price matching protocols.

 One important component of their business is the physical experience for customers with higher end products.  [Customers still prefer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171116005542/en/June20-Study-65-Percent-of-Americans-Prefer-Shopping-at-Physical-Stores-to-See-and-Touch-a-Product-Before-Purchasing) to see items in person before they purchase them, and this preference is probably generally stronger the more expensive a purchase is. In addition to this, [computers and other electronics are delicate](https://youtu.be/RBv3HJ7y1Rs). Based on this, some or most consumers may feel more comfortable seeing their electronics and verifying its condition before they make a purchase.  If these assumptions are true, then buying from best buy compared to buying online is like purchasing antique china online versus from an antiques dealer.  Best buy may have this advantage now, but if more retailers that are manufactured or can get better deals from manufacturers realize this and can open physical stores profitably, best buy could lose their advantage and will quickly go out of business. 

They currently have an advantage over other physical retailers because of their focus on a narrow group of products and employee expertise in the given lines of products. If physical competitors can build up better varieties of consumer electronics and employ better informed employees, best buy could lose its competitive advantage.

Some of the notable risks the company has identified:

* Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences.
* We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.
* We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season

I will go over Microsoft stores in the weakness section.

## Revenue Breakdown / Company segments:

90% of sales come from inside the United States.  Sales are broken down into the following categories

* Computing and Mobile Phones: 47% of revenue
* Consumer electronics: 30%
* Appliances: 10%
* Entertainment: 8%
* Services: 4%
* Other: 1%

## Industry position

Many of best buys competitors are much larger retailers with many more product categories.  Competitors are retailers rather than manufacturers, because although BBY competes for sales with the manufacturers, the manufacturers are also suppliers and in that sense have complete control over the competition.

Major direct competitors are Amazon, Alibaba, Walmart, Costco and target.  Best buy is the smallest of these, and has the lowest P/E, PEG, P/S, P/C, and P/FCF ratios.  Their P/B is higher than Alibaba and walmart.   They have the highest dividend, ROE, and ROI out of their competitors and the second highest ROA, current ratio, second lowest D/E. They have a low profit margin, but it is average compared to competitors.

Their industry position is strong. But they address a much smaller share of consumer purchases compared to their retail competitors due to their narrower line of business.  They have an advantage for now in this narrow line of business, clearly supported by their current relative position to competitors.  Unfortunately, it would be much easier for the physical competitors to improve their consumer electronics segments than it would be for best buy because best buy already has established relationships and trained employees in the sector so there's not much more improvements that can be made.

## Overview/Growth and Developments

* They have slow revenue growth, and a consistent but low earnings
* Their profit margin is low but consistent
* They slowly buy back shares and occasionally issue them, but the overall trend is more buying back than issuing. YoY annual buybacks account for about 1-2% of shares outstanding on average
* They have an A- credit rating, not bad, not great.  
* Gross margin is consistently around 25%.​​​
* They repeatedly keep a lot of current liabilities and little debt on their balance sheet. Historically they have always been able to adequately cover obligations
* Looking at their past trends, It would be reasonable to say that they could be expected to grow at 5% per year.
* They historically do not keep a lot of cash on hand.  
* They have no notable legal proceedings.
* There is nothing notable about them recently in the news.

## Catalyst

It is extremely unlikely that there would be any massive changes in the business other than being acquired in a year's time.  If they decide to sell say groceries or sports equipment tomorrow, it would take a long time for them to create the proper conditions for the new products to be sold. That being said, if they did decide to do something like this, I am quite confident that they would implement it properly to add real good value to shareholders, just like they have integrated newer products into their business. 

Best Buy online has the advantage of being able to supply hardware inventory to customers looking for very specific parts.  If Best Buy can expand their physical hardware retail segment to sell a larger variety of chips and other components for PC building and repair, that would attract some serious value as they would be one of the first major retailers to do so.  

## Strengths &amp; Weaknesses

Best buy’s most direct competition are arguably radio shack in america and the source in canada (RIP future shop).  If any of you have been into either the source or radio shack, it is obvious that they are far behind best buy as physical retailers. Apple stores may take away from apple product sales at best buy but best buy has realized this and replaced some retail space with PCs that was once occupied by apple products.  In the physical realm, best buy has a huge advantage and will continue to have this advantage as long as people are skeptical of delivery people and making large purchases without seeing the product.

Best buy has the ability to expand into sub sectors of tech that are continuously emerging and sometimes disappearing.  For their salespeople, selling printers or whatever new technology pops up in the next five years will probably be much easier than if a Walmart salesperson was in the same position. I hate to even hear the word IOT, but it is quite likely that best buy will consider or be involved in the next ‘smart’ device.  

Microsoft stores pose a risk to best buy, even if they are all closed.  They carried a smaller variety of products that fit into the same category that 47% of best buys sales. Unlike best buy, Microsoft has tremendous capital inflows and they are able to open up 100s of stores without being close to setting off financial alarms.  Microsoft has closed all of its past retail locations, but that's not to say that if their management gets bored and has a couple billion lying around, they could really disrupt best buys market if they decide to sell more than just their own products. (Apple stores cost 8.3-10M, so I am assuming MSFT stores cost $10M each).

They are a high revenue business, but you would be an embarrassment to an analyst if you look at the revenue figures and immediately come to a conclusion about the business. Profit margins are not great.  The balance sheet structure is odd and cash flows are small.  They aren't drowning in debt but they also aren’t keeping their coffers very full.  They pay too high a dividend and buyback too many shares when they should be building up more useful cash reserves. On this note, earnings do not adequately cover current obligations, and they historically have not.  The majority of obligations seem to be inventory based.  Just under half of current assets are inventory, and about 65% of current liabilities are accounts payable. It doesn't take a genius to put two and two together here. 

## Valuation

My valuation of best buy gives them a margin of safety between -10% to 30%.  They have a good business, and they have predictable customers, but they have lacked growth and profitability that would be expected from a company with the status of their competition.  It could just be bringing profit margins to 6%.  Their return on equity/assets/investments doesn't really mean much more than a nice thing to look at.  The returns they are getting are not actually staying in the company.  They are being used to pay off whatever obligation they have next up on the list.  It's the classic romantic tragedy where a beautiful thing is corrupted by some arbitrary sin - their sin being that they are trying to sell products at a very competitive price without recognizing that the price won’t wreck the business if it creeps up a little bit each year.

## Opinion

I like best buy more than I like my wife.  They have the size and the potential to become much more valuable, but it’s a decision only their financial management can make. They are in a position they have been in for a long time.  It's a vulnerable position where they lack any ability to lower profit margins healthily. Sure, they've done fine in the past decade, and from the looks of it they could be fine in the next decade. But the risk associated with their vulnerability is high if management is incompetent.  I would buy best buy, but I wouldn't put my whole portfolio in them. It i could, I would buy the whole business outright and start increasing products offered in physical stores as long as it can be done safely and also start bringing prices up nice and slow.  They would be a business I would be more happy to own than many more financially stable companies.  But unfortunately I cannot buy all of best buy, and corporate management is often more bureaucratic and greedy than not. 

 I would rate them a hold unless they replace the CEO with a more aggressive character but can still listen to the CFO and the rest of management without any issues.  The CFO is a bit of a man of mystery. I can't find out a lot about him, but it is clear he can do better.  A new CFO from a background of successful mature growth and expansion would work wonders for the company.  If I see some shifts in management that I like, I would be very happy to make them 20% of my portfolio.

76,investing,getpsychosocial,Possible Unicorn Stock Found?,"Hello (investing) world!  This is my first time posting what I will call a ""micro"" due diligence on a company, been investing a little over 4 years.  My intent is not to push the excitement train / pumping like many recent momentum stocks, but to see whether I have a blind spot in what could be a long-term hold for me.

Just for a tad of context, I had recently begun DCA'ing into Newegg (NEGG) in early to mid June, shortly before my position leaped some 76% in one day.  Me, being one the more conservative side and a bit of a doofus, cashed out entirely from my position.  The stock then ran something like another 250% the next 2 days.  While SI was high (\~25%), the more exciting part of the company was it was being valued around 2-2.5bn when I was buying (for a company raking in over 1bn per year in revenue).  That discount was what really compelled me to buy in.  Could've held longer but still great return, can't complain.

Okay, so the company I'm DCA'ing into now and feel more bullish about is GoodRx (GDRX).  This is just a few days of research, so just scraping the surface of where the company stands.  Same type of story as NEGG, \~25% SI, but perhaps more important than that is that it is valued at 2bn with a service that has saved consumers more than 30bn in prescription drug costs. There was a big sell off from what, on the surface (price action), looks like really poor 2020 performance.  But my hunch is that most all of this can be explained by COVID and the extreme drop in the number of people going to their regular doctors' appointments, scheduled surgeries being cancelled, etc.  Even then, revenues were $550mil in 2020, ONE FOURTH of its current market cap.  The company reportedly has the third most popular health app on the app stores, and was also apparently quite helpful for those looking for their vaccines.  One portion of the company is delivering tele-health services, which I would argue is largely becoming the new normal even as things open back up.  To top it off, the company has 4 consecutive quarters of positive earnings, more cash than long-term debt on the balance sheet, and is trading only 6% above its all-time low.  If it hit a short squeeze, this could also be a long-term hold investment because the fundamentals of the business is growth/expansion and lower bankruptcy risk.  Plus it could rally much higher on next quarter(s) earnings because the re-opening could allow them to massively beat last year's revenue numbers (pent-up healthcare demand from delayed care from COVID lockdowns).

Am I missing something?  Any bearish indicators you all can find that would suggest this company is tanking and does not have a sustainable business model?

TLDR: Bullish on a Rx drug savings program with growing revenues, arguably oversold and too much pessimism.  Attractive valuation and possible short squeeze with sustainable price growth.

They have a limited time promotion going on right now: Register an account with the link below and get 2 stocks worth up to $2300.

For the first stock, you don't need to do anything. Just create an account. To claim the second stock, you need to deposit $5 into the account. Once funds are settled, you can claim the stock.

If you're not interested in investing, i'd still recommend signing up just for the cash. You don't even have to use their app, you can just sell whatever stocks you get from the promotion when the stock market is open during the week and transfer the money back to your account. And then spend with whatever you want, or transfer the money to your brokerage of choice.

89,investing,lib3rty47,"Does TQQQ break ""leverage etfs are not long term investments""?","In my opinion, i see it quite the opposite, but only using DCA. Holding TQQQ for an extended period of time even through two major bear markets can still outperform the underlying by a significant amount with proper and consistent use of DCA. However, an investor would have to be nearly robotic in their ability to stick to the plan and not withdraw any funds even when their portfolio is nearly wiped out. The investor would also have to benefit from one of the longest and greatest bull markets in history at the end of the investing period.

The Data.
The DCA assumptions were that an investor started with a portfolio size of $1000 and on the first trading day of each month, deposited $1000 to the portfolio. Based on a time period of March 1999 to March 2021, this would mean the investor deposits $265,000 of their own capital over the period studied.

As a baseline to compare to, if the investor invested this amount as a lump sum instead, with QQQ the investor would have $1.65M or about 521% return at the end of the period. A TQQQ investor would only have $360K or 36% return over 22 years. This is the danger of lump sum investing in leveraged ETFs right before major crashes as QQQ easily crushed the return of TQQQ even over this extended period of time.

Using DCA over the entire 22 period creates a completely different picture than the lump sum case. Now, investing in TQQQ absolutely crushes QQQ, with a final portfolio value of $12M compared to about $1.5M for QQQ. Using DCA for QQQ actually lowers the final portfolio value slightly compared to lump sum while using DCA for TQQQ helps smooth out the volatility in the earlier years as most of your capital is deployed in the later part of the time period, during the extended bull market post 2009. 

Final Thoughts.
I would only recommend holding TQQQ long term with a DCA strategy to investors with the absolute highest level of risk tolerance and only invest money they can afford to see fall over 90% at times and in amounts that are not needed for many years. TQQQ with DCA is not a get rich quick scheme and it is a merciless violent rollercoaster that rewards only the ones with no but holes.",1626399654,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ol6tza/does_tqqq_break_leverage_etfs_are_not_long_term/

It seems like the catalysts that led to the dot com bubble are the same ones we see in todays investing space as well


It seems like low interest rates led to leverage in the system, and once the fed started reeling in this leverage with higher interest rates, a classic blown off top occurred. Am I missing something?

If that's the case, and if we're gonna have a repeat, then I don't think the market will wait for the rate increases as long as it did in the past given that the fed didn't give advance notice in the past.

23,investing,dlt76028,What do y'all think about this $HIMS DD?,"Some general Info about HIMS-

Hims &amp; Hers ($HIMS) is a telemedicine company which allows anybody across the continental United States(and soon to be UK and Europe) to purchase medicine discreetly, safely, quickly, and inexpensively straight to your door. For prescription medicine, Hims &amp; Hers employs hundreds of specialized doctors, which can prescribe medicine through call, text, or video chat. Hims &amp; Hers offers a wide variety of products which continues to expand, such as:

-Hair Loss and Care

-Sex products (ED, PE, Birth Control)

-Skin Care/Acne products

-Covid Tests

-Supplements

-Primary Care

-Mental Care

etc...

So I wanted to do some DD because Earnings should be coming out sometime early-mid august and I expect this to be the first quarter where they can show positive EBITDA, I would expect nothing less than absolutely stellar numbers across the board, with a highlight on YoY revenue growth.

- Customer acquisition, expanding their base of users and subscriptions by expanding into multiple sectors of mens, womens and even mental health

- Bridging the gap between being a telehealth provider and the standard retail brick and mortar model, by establishing partnerships with companies like Target and Urban outfitters putting their products in these big box stores that we all shop at.

- Acquiring companies like Apostrophe, which is a multi-specialty telehealth platform, it was also a competitor, well not anymore now HIMS is the parent company. (Remember how FB liked to buy out all of their competition until they became the biggest platform on the planet... ya HIMS is taking a page straight out of the Zuck's playbook)

- Future Growth prospects; HIMS is expanding into the UK and Europe giving them access to a greater reach of customers, and as we all know, balding, ED, Acne, etc... is not something there is a permanent cure for and something a lot of people suffer from, with a subscription based model they're basically able to lock in long time recurring customers, so you put 2 and 2 together, you put the product in more countries, you get more subscribers.

- Before you tell me that HIMS hasn't turned a profit BLA BLA BLA, Let's look at their last earnings report.

Financially stable - over 90 Million in cash on hand + short term investments, with 0 short/long term debt
Gross Margin of 77% last Quarter, 74% for 2020 (54% in 2019)
2.6B Market Cap
Negative (but improving) Cash Flow
Q4 EPS of -.07 (Beat by .09)
Revenue of $148.8 MM for 2020, 80% yoy growth
2020 Q4 Revenue of $41.5 MM (Beat by $4.47 MM)
Q1 2021 Revenue expects $48 - $50 MM
$195 - $205 MM overall 2021 Revenue estimate
Over 3 Million consultations
91% Recurring Revenue

Simply put, Hims &amp; Hers has consistent, growing revenue and gross margin growth, and the driving factor for their negative EBITDA are their investments into furthering expansion, customer acquisition/company acquisitions that will only help solidify their cash flow and subscription services on the back end in the future.

Last point, just from a trading perspective, HIMS is down thirty percent the last month, and went down 8 percent today, Now is the time to buy a few weeks before a potentially huge earnings report, and with 52 wk low of 8.09, It's definitely at or near the bottom right now. Please note, this isn't a fucking short squeeze BUT the short interest 13% which is kind of high...

TL;DR I've got a boner for HIMS, Jacked to the Dick, YOLO, 8/20 10c all in",1626381813,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ol1ij7/what_do_yall_think_about_this_hims_dd/

Zillow's  commissioned Sales Executives use words like ""hot"", ""vetted"", ""Buyer""  ""leads"" to con licensed real estate agents into 5 figure, 3 month long  contracts that Zillow bots then pack with junk contacts at $300-$500 a  pop. This junk includes random contacts looking for a rental service,  random contacts who already have a real estate agent, random contacts  who have no idea what they are doing and worse. They are no where near  ""vetted Buyer leads"" as Zillow's commissioned Sales Executives claim.  Some even indicate that when Zillow's bots/logarithm's can't meet the  20-30 contact quota they are programmed to lower the bar even further by  secretly recycling old, already used, invalid or even made-up contacts  as a ""New Lead"" to a different real estate agent.

Is  a class action lawsuit against publicly traded Zillow Co. (Zillow,  Trulia, Streeteasy) by thousands of real estate agents imminent? What  will happen when the SEC/FTC publicly take action about complaints  piling in from real estate agents? Will this become a case study in the  ever widening gap between what commissioned Sales Executives say and  what logarithms/bots actually do? Do some Zillow insiders already know  what's happening? Is this why Zillow's stock continues to slide sharper  and sharper? Have institutional investors like ARK, Burry, Buffet and  Ackerman already caught wind of this somehow and done their own research  and set up short positions themselves to capitalize on the continuing  crash as the truth continues to get out? Are some propaganda machines  trying to write off the six month long continued sharp slide as just an  extended ""dip"" to give themselves and other insiders more time to get  positions? The timing of this post is purely coincidental but it begs  the question if Zillow's ten year turd of fraud will all come crashing  down by it's 10 year anniversary (July 21, 2021)?

Keep  in mind that Zillow's contracts with licensed real estate agents do  what they can to prevent agents from publicly talking about Zillow. (No  surprise, classic move by a publicly traded corporation). Also keep in  mind that if someone provided screenshots or other ""proof"" of this it  could easily be disregarded as photoshop, blah, blah, blah.... So if you  doubt this has been going on and you're looking to confirm your own  ideas, your best bet is to call a few local real estate agents in your  area or even out of your area. Share this perspective with them and ask  what they have heard. Keep in mind that only 20% of real estate  licensees have a license longer than two years and it seems most of  Zillow's targets are new licensees with a new credit card in hand so if  you can't find an active licensee to talk with this about you may want  to consider asking them if they heard about new licenses who got conned  into this by Zillow and who also aren't licensed anymore. Talk to real,  active agents who actually do deals not just whoever answers the phone  to make sure you aren't just talking to a receptionist...or a Zillow  bot.",1626378255,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ol0c2k/is_zillow_cos_zg_ever_sharpening_decline_because/

Hope you are having a fantastic Thursday. So, to give you a little background about me, I am 29 years old, I currently worth in B2B sales, my wife and I combined have a portfolio that is about $150,000, mostly mutual funds. On June 30th, this was our allocation across our savings &amp; investments which is what I consider our ""portfolio.""

\- 55.02% - Equities (Domestic) \[Clarifying here that we are in the U.S.\]

\- 26.18% - Equities (International &amp; Emerging)

\- 12.67% - Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents

\- 05.52% - Bonds

\- 00.61% - Cryptocurrency (Small allocation to Bitcoin &amp; Ether on BlockFi)

This month, I decided to switch things up with the ""explore"" piece of my core &amp; explore. Originally, I had about $10,000 in a trading account where I was trading options. I've had more mixed success this year than I had last year, so I decided to dial some of that back, to make a long story short.

I just put $3,000 into [Masterworks.io](https://Masterworks.io) on three different pieces of art and I've put $500 on Groundfloor with $10 put into 50 different projects.

Vinovest is somewhat similar to Masterworks, but with wine instead of art. Their minimum per bottle is $1,000 and they store the wine and manage the investment for you. This would basically be something for long-term buy &amp; hold and adding money when and if the portfolio gets larger. Like, I wouldn't add money to it again until I hit like $250K or higher and probably at least not until after I finish my MBA.

Is anyone here currently using Vinovest? The management fee is like 2.6%, but that makes sense because wine has storage costs and whatnot and I'd be curious to know if the management fee is taken out of the fund or out of my initial investment.

I have a call scheduled with them for Monday afternoon to go over questions but I'd love to hear from anyone currently using them successfully as part of their overall portfolio.

44,investing,catgambler,Comparing 529 Accounts vs. Series I Savings Bonds (for college or otherwise),"I've posted this as a comment, but I feel like it's good advice so I'm making a post.  Hopefully, if I am wrong, someone can point it out in the comments, and everyone can laugh at my expense (but save more money for their children).

My daughter was born late last year, and I've begun saving for her.

What comes to mind, obviously, is a [529 account](https://www.fidelity.com/529-plans/faqs-about-accounts).  As far as I can tell, a 529 account has these features:

* Interest rate largely determined by the Fed Funds Rate (some states offer a minimum of 2%)
* Interest not subject to Federal Taxes (unless you withdraw for non-college)
* Interest not subject to State tax in 30 states (unless you withdraw for non-college)
* Penalty for non-college withdrawal is 10% of earnings withdrawn + State/Federal taxation on the earnings

But when I've been investigating other possibilities, it seems like the [Series I Savings Bond](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_ibonds_glance.htm) is actually quite superior, for the time being:

* Inflation-adjusted APY, currently 3.54% adjusted semiannually
* Interest is (State) tax-free always, but taxed Federally *unless you withdraw for college!*
* No penalty for non-college withdrawal
* Penalty for withdrawals before 5 yrs is 3 months' of interest payments
* $10,000/yr limit on savings bond purchases (so you've got to start early)

So from what I can tell, the Series I is a much better choice for saving in general, and confers all the benefits (which mostly are focused on taxes) that a 529 account could confer *with a much better interest rate.* If my daughter does go to college, she won't pay any taxes on the earnings in the Series I bond. If she *doesn't* go to college, she can withdraw and only pay Federal tax, instead of paying Federal + State + 10%.

Do I sound insane to anyone who actually knows what they are doing?  To me, this seems cut and dry:  do the Series I to the max.",1626373443,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/okyq3v/comparing_529_accounts_vs_series_i_savings_bonds/

Just want to get some honest opinions here.  This ticker is down well over 50% after the disastrous CBP2077 launch, but I really think the markets overreacting to that.  Its stock is holding a very solid support at around $10-11, they're paying dividends, and trending in a positive direction with the announcement of a new Witcher remake.

CD Projekt Red has multiple revenue streams beside CBP2077 and the Witcher will always be a cash cow.  What catalyst do you think could cause the stock to go down any further?  I'm thinking the worst case is it just holds in the low 10's for a while until they actually announce their next big game.

(You can skip this part if you want) So recently I’ve been doing some DD and found mmat! I found out they had a special divi $1-20 per share the company was once torchlight (trch). I got 37 shares of that dividend. I also joined a subreddit called {deleted} and they have the best DD. 

(Important) A DD post was made explaining my the divi COULD be $35 a share. This is big and here’s why. If the dividend amount is released that it is $35 a share the price will go ballistic. Call options bought before the ex. Dividend date have 100 dividends attached. If the divi is this high then call options even $5 otm will be exercised to try and get that extra $3500 for free. This will be the gamma squeeze will might see on Friday due to options expiring.

(Short squeeze) tomorrow makes the start of the t21 rules for ftd’s this should make shorts start covering. The (possible) gamma squeeze should scare shorts into covering and this is called a double whammy squeeze. Big gains there! NFA

(The kicker) mmat is a metamaterials company. They make materials that cannot be found in nature and the potential for these materials are endless. This company is in the tech and semiconductor category on the nasdaq and if you look at other stocks in this sector you will see that none are below $50. Mmat is seriously undervalued and they barely have any competition (almost none). This company is worth $75 easy but I personally say they are worth $100 a share. I’m am not a financial advisor! But mmat (this might kill some of you to hear) will probably squeeze bigger than amc. But most of us are in it for the long run. This is like owning aapl or amzn at $4.37 a share!! This company will be known more well than Facebook in 10 years (or less). Again these are my claims and not guaranteed.

48,investing,toomuchtodotoday,Dividend Agreement Cripples Saudi Aramco,"The transformation of Saudi Arabia’s flagship asset, Aramco, from perpetual cash-generation machine into a debt-laden giant is set to pick up pace in the coming weeks with a series of schemes aimed at raising much-needed funding for the now-beleaguered oil and gas company.  

It has not been forgotten by many senior Saudis that the reason for this terrible transformation of the former jewel in the crown of Saudi Arabia’s business sector - and the cornerstone of any power that the Kingdom might have had on the world stage – into a crippled corporate money pit is that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) did not want to lose face in the initial public offering (IPO) for Aramco upon which he had staked his personal political reputation. 

Having opened up the books of Aramco to the scrutiny of the international investment community in the run-up to the December 2019 IPO, so toxic a proposition was Aramco considered to be by then that a range of increasingly desperate measures were taken to sell even a small proportion of the originally intended stake. The most desperate of these was the pledge to guarantee a dividend payment to shareholders in Aramco of US$18.75 billion every single quarter of every single year – a total of US$75 billion every single year.

In other words, each and every year, Aramco has to pay out around three times the entire amount that it received for the entire IPO. Just like the individual who cannot afford the interest repayments on their maxed-out credit card anymore so decides to take on a second credit card debt to pay the interest on the debt of the first – a deadly debt trap from which there is no exit – Saudi Arabia now has no alternative but to continue to sell off assets (the equivalent of selling the family silver, and this can only be done once), sell more bonds (taking on more debt and the interest on this form of Saudi debt is going up with every such sale), and cancel projects (which are crucial to the long-term success of Aramco). 

The entire list of money-raising schemes reads like a business school text book of how a company can destroy itself in less than five years. In this case, the start date was 11 December 2019 when the IPO of Aramco was forced through by MbS, despite all sound business logic dictating that it should be put on ice indefinitely due to the lack of broad-based interest from any serious international institutional investors, especially in the West. Since then there have been multiple bond offerings from Saudi Arabia aimed at plugging the ongoing deficit created by the gargantuan US$75 billion per year guaranteed dividend payment to Aramco shareholders. 

The problem with this strategy is that the global investment market has a limit to how much Saudi debt it wants to hold at any one time or, to put it another way, in the matrix of their global asset portfolios, international institutional investors have a certain percentage of the total allocated to holding Saudi debt, at which level the risk/reward balance is considered acceptable. After that point, the appetite of international institutional investors drops off a proverbial cliff and the only way to entice them into buying into further debt offerings is to pay them more compensation to take it, in the form of the coupon rate on the bonds. Exactly the same risk/reward analysis, albeit across a broader spectrum of a country’s and corporate’s financial assets, is undertaken by revolving credit facilities offered by banks or similar rating debt-raising mechanism, such as syndicated loans. Just like the aforementioned credit card victim that has reached bottom, there comes a point when the options to refinance the ever-growing debt and its ballooning interest payments just run out. 

A sign that this is precisely what is already happening to Saudi Arabia was that the most recent bond sale – in June – was confined to a shariah-compliant bond (sukuk) offering and not a conventional international bond offering as had been the two previous bond offerings by the company (a debut US$12 billion sale in 2019 and an US$8 billion offering in November last year). The market for bonds governed by shariah principles – forbidding investing in activities that can be deemed speculative, involve uncertainty, entail the payment of interest, are fundamentally unjust to participants, or are involved in prohibited businesses (such as gambling, alcohol, and the sale of certain foodstuffs) – is a captive one, often characterised by a lack of suitable supply compared to a steady weight of demand.

The ‘suitability factor’ narrowed the sukuk availability list down further after 2008 when a wide-ranging audit by the global shariah finance watchdog - the Accounting Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), in Bahrain – revealed that the repurchase undertakings found in around 85 percent of apparently shariah-compliant bond- and equity- fund structures that were based on ‘mudaraba’ and ‘musharaka’ actually violated the Islamic duty to share risk. Given this market structure, even the ‘junk-rated’ Oman was able to draw in more than US$11.5 billion in orders for its US$1.75 billion sukuk offering in June. Saudi Aramco’s US$6 billion tri-maturity sukuk offering did only marginally better, attracting just over US$60 billion in total bids for the paper.   

Also fitting were the very recent comments from Aramco’s senior vice president for corporate development, Abdulaziz Al Gudaimi, that are flag a range of further large asset sales in the coming months. According to these comments, these asset sales will happen “irrespective of any market conditions” and will be aimed at producing “double-digit billions of dollars” in funds. The divestment of more of Aramco’s assets will do nothing to improve its business positioning in the coming years, especially in light of the cancellations and suspensions to existing projects that it has been forced to make due to the desire to push through the 2019 IPO, whatever – quite literally – the cost. The once much-vaunted flagship US$20 billion crude-to-chemicals plant at Yanbu on Saudi’s Red Sea coast, for one, has been subject to indefinite rolling suspensions, according to various reports. The similarly high-profile purchase of a 25 percent multi-billion-dollar stake in Sempra Energy’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Texas remains uncertain, although Sempra has said that it continues to work with Aramco and others “to move our project at Port Arthur LNG forward.” In the same vein, Aramco has suspended its key US$10 billion deal to expand into mainland China’s refining and petrochemicals sector, via a complex in the Northeastern province of Liaoning that would have seen Saudi supply up to 70 percent of the crude oil for the planned 300,000 barrels per day refinery. 

In the first full year of the cripplingly large Aramco dividend coming due, it had to be financed in large part through budget cuts over and above the US$15 billion in Aramco’s annual capital spending alluded to by Aramco’s chief executive officer, Amin Nasser, just after the first half profits figures were unveiled.

This took the total capital spending down from around US$40 billion to around US$25 billion. Further reports stated that even this US$25 billion figure was reduced by another US$5 billion, taking the total capital spending in the year from US$25 billion to US$20 billion. However, every second of every day of every month of every year - whatever Aramco does, whatever it sells, whatever it cancels, whatever it cuts back, however many people it sacks – the meter keeps on running, adding US$205 million every day to its IPO debt in the form of obligated dividend payments.

Just in the last year or so alone, Aramco’s debt levels have soared, with its debt to equity gearing increasing by 28 percent from minus 5 percent in early 2020 to plus 23 percent in March this year, way above the company’s own debt/equity ratio cap of 15 percent. Even with oil prices currently around the healthiest levels they have been since Aramco was ordered by the state to overproduce to crash oil prices in yet another failed Saudi-instigated oil price war in 2020, the once formidable state oil firm is struggling every time to meet the crushing dividend payment schedule, despite continuing to make good profits. Indeed, just over a month ago, Aramco declared a 30 percent jump in first-quarter 2021 profit, thanks to the recovery in oil prices, but the company’s free cash flow still fell significantly short of the US$18.75 billion dividend obligation for that period.

50,investing,valuescott,The benefits and drawbacks of share repurchases,"Generally when I see share repurchases, I waste no time and conclude that it is a positive action made by the company.  But after spending some time thinking about it and doing some research, I’m less sure that this is always the case.

Benefits of share repurchases:

* Generally a signal that management thinks the company is undervalued, especially but not exclusively if repurchases are uncommon
* If the company issues stock options as compensation, they can repurchase shares and use that when the employee exercises their options.  
* Repurchases can be used to remove overhanging stock, that is when there is a large portion of stock that has flooded or is about to flood the market, the company can repurchase the outstanding stock to prevent or bring up the share price, or just to scoop up some stock at a lower than usual price.  
* It indirectly offers more choice to the shareholders compared to dividends.  If the number of shares decreases under normal conditions, the shareholder has the option to hold the stock or sell it and pay taxes realizing the capital gain, whereas with dividends, the shareholder has no choice but to accept the dividends and pay taxes on them.
* In times of temporary prosperity, management may be reluctant to increase dividends because it would look unfavorable when they have to decrease them after.  Instead, if they buyback shares this adds similar value but carries with it less expectation to be consistent.  
* This point ties in with the one above.  If a firm compensates shareholders with both repurchases and dividends, then the firm has a cushion of share repurchases that can increase or decrease while dividends stay the same.
* The obvious fact that repurchases increase the value per share and that price per share generally follows.

Drawbacks of share repurchases:

* The company could pay too high a price for shares
* Some shareholders prefer dividends to share repurchases
* The company may repurchase shares even when there are better alternatives for its capital allocation
* Share buybacks can be used to manipulate per-share figures 
* Buybacks could be used just to reduce dilution from massive compensation in the form of stock or options

In my opinion, a divide between consistent dividends and share repurchases is the most attractive option as long as the firm is not disregarding its own obligations and better uses of capital. 

I hope you get something out of this and I am eager to hear about things that I missed.",1626217685,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ojrd9k/the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_share_repurchases/

74,investing,jordanw71,Meet TATTOOED CHEF. The Growth Stock You've Never Heard Of.,"\*I Am Reposting With Some New Information After Today's Big Announcement\*

I don't like to take risks in the stock market. But when I do, I want the odds to be in my favor. If I am investing in a growth stock, I want to see returns of 15% annually (Double Up In Five Years) When it comes to this company, I believe we have potential for both long-term and short-potential. In this post, I am going to break down everything I know about this company and explain why it is my largest position in my portfolio. Grab your crayons folks and follow along.

# INTRODUCTION

Here is a quick run down of Tattooed Chef and what they do. They are a food company selling frozen foods products in the freezer isle at major grocery outlets. Products are plant based to take advantage of vegan, vegetarian, and plant based food trends. While products are sold in the United States, production takes place in Italy. Production costs are much cheaper overseas and allows for higher margins here in the U.S. TTCF is vertically integrated allowing for greater control of product quality and adaptation. It's a new age food company clicking on all cylinders and picking up steam competing against companies of yesteryear.

# Revenue Growth For TTCF

This company is growing like a BEAST. Here's some of the numbers from 2017 and on.

2017 Revenue ---------------- **$32.5 Million**

2018 Revenue ---------------- **$47.9 Million (+47.4%)**

2019 Revenue----------------- **$84.9 Million (+77.2%)**

2020 Revenue----------------  **$148.5 Million (+74.9%)**

2021 Revenue (Projected) **$239.3 Million (+61.1%)**

2022 Revenue (Projected) **$323.0 Million (+35.0%)**

# The Growth Number EVERYONE Is Ignoring

The growth numbers up top seem impressive right? Well this is a case where just top line revenues do not tell the whole story. TTCF sells ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products as well as some private label products. What are some of the most valuable assets in the world? Loyal brands. Tattooed Chef realizes this and for the last few years they have been solely focused on its core brand rather than private label deals. Why does Coca Cola dominate the drink space for decades? Because the brand is globally recognized and it's a product people trust. Is TTCF there yet? No. Will it ever get there? Maybe. But so far they are on the right track to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

HERE ARE THE GROWTH NUMBERS FOR **ONLY** TTCF LABELED PRODUCTS

&amp;#x200B;

FULL YEAR 2019 - **$18.3 Million**

FULL YEAR 2020 - **$84.6 Million (363% Increase!!!)**

&amp;#x200B;

2020 3rd Quarter - **$22.6 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 288%)**

2020 4th Quarter - **$23.9 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 172%)**

2021 1st Quarter - **$36.0 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 105%)**

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, branded revenue is what is really important for this company. The CEO himself has publicly stated that private label revenue over time will be 'phased out'. In my opinion, private label revenue is mostly irrelevant with this growth story. While 50%, 60%, and 70% revenue growth may be impressive, the numbers that really matter, (branded products) are growing well over 100% year-over-year.

# Earnings &amp; Profitability Potential

The CEO and founder of the company (see information below) has had a long history of running food businesses. Before running public companies, the businesses were ran to feed his family and live a prosperous life. So, Tattooed Chef is ran with the intention of being profitable **AND** growing rapidly. For a company in its early growth stages, this is very rare. Most businesses, regardless of the industry, typically lose money hand over fist. The fast cash burn usually requires companies in these early growth stages to take on debt and issue additional shares. This usually leads to weaker balance sheets and diluted long-term shareholder value. For Tattooed Chef this is not the case. Shareholder dilution is unlikely and debt is unnecessary for the **ALREADY** profitable business. I doubt long term debt will accumulate unless a large acquisition is made.

So far, TTCF has produced minimal profits. This is mainly due to them reinvesting virtually all profits back into the business for further growth. The chart is more accurate for results from late 2019 and early 2020. The chart is unfortunately skewed heavily in the last few quarters due to a large tax benefit (changing from S corporation to C corporation) and other things such as the recent acquisition. (More on that later. But, as you can see, the company can make money **AND** grow revenue for their flagship ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products &gt;100%.

The hardest part of this analysis is trying to determine future profitability. While profits are growing, it is hard to know what type of net income and EPS numbers this company will be doing in 2026. In the chart below, revenue is expected to reach $1.0 Billion annually in 2026. Forecasts this far out can sometimes be a far cry from actual results. But, in this case I believe it is an attainable number by 2026. The big question here is... How much of that will turn into profit?

Food businesses generally have lower margins. Once again, trying to forecast net income for a company like this in 2026 is very difficult. But, we will use an assumption of 10% of revenue turning into net income in 2026. Margins will be higher for TTCF versus competitors such as Tyson Foods (See Below). A Tyson Foods for example, generally turns \~5% into net income. TTCF could make 10% an attainable number in the next five years.

So assuming 10% into net income out of $1.0 Billion in revenue, that means net income would be an assumed $100 Million in 2026. Here are valuation/stock price estimates based on those profitability estimates. The stock currently currently trades at almost exactly $20.00 as of the time of writing at 07/10/2021

**Lower End - 2026 PE Ratio of 20 - Market Cap of $2.0 Billion - Stock Price of \~$24.40**

**The Middle - 2026 PE Ratio of 25 - Market Cap of $2.5 Billion - Stock Price of \~$30.51**

**Higher End - 2026 PE Ratio of 30 - Market Cap of $3.0 Billion - Stock Price of \~$36.61**

# CEO Sam Galletti &amp; Creative Director Sarah Galletti

The CEO is basically a veteran in regards to the food industry. He seems pretty credible and hard working. Rather than give my personal take on someone's character and ability to perform, it would probably be best to do your own due diligence on the CEO. But, from what I can tell, he seems to be a good leader/founder of the company. His daughter Sarah his literally is ""The Tattooed Chef"" is the face behind the company. She creates, designs, alters, etc. mostly all of TTCF's products. Here is their website posting information about the two.

# VALUATION

Tattooed Chef currently trades at a market cap of $1.65 Billion. For a growth company at this stage, P/S ratio likely a better metric to use in terms of valuation rather than P/E ratio. Here are the numbers for 2021 and 2022.

**2021 P/S Ratio - 6.89**

**2022 P/S Ratio - 5.11**

This company is trading at 5 times next years revenue. Considering the growth trajectory moving forward, I would consider this to have considerable value. The company also has $185 Million in cash. Considering this very large cash pile (relative to the company's size) it makes the company's market cap a bit more attractive.

# MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS

In May of this year, Tattooed Chef announced the acquisition New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory. This acquisition was approximately $35 Million. The company still has $185 Million in cash (as of the last earnings report). This leaves lots of room for further expansions and acquisitions.

While only $35 Million was spent, a significant amount of revenue will be generated from this acquisition. ""We will be immediately addressing the $1 billion Frozen Mexican Food category once the transactions close. At full capacity, we believe Foods of New Mexico can contribute up to $200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years and create significant value for all our stakeholders.""

$200 Million in annual revenue for only $35 Million? Sounds like a good deal to me.

# NEW DEAL WITH WHOLE FOODS

TTCF is in many large retailers already. Target, Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco, Whole Foods, etc. Many other big names are currently in the work as well. Whole Foods is there most recent big announcement in May of this year with two products being offered. The two products being offered are listed below.

# LEAKED INFORMATION ABOUT TTCF IN KROGER

Kroger is the 2nd largest grocer in the U.S. and a deal with Kroger could be MASSIVE for this company. Has a deal been announced yet? Nope. But I have some good news. I am in a discord chat full of other TTCF shareholders. It appears that (while it has not been publicly announced by Tattooed Chef) a soft launch of their products are being sold at a few Kroger locations. Photos and prices can be found listed online in certain areas of Kroger's website. Two different shareholders I have personally spoken to have been able to buy TTCF at Kroger locations. This would obviously be HUGE for TTCF if they are able to get this deal. While it may be unconfirmed for now, it seems to me that very soon a deal is inevitable. Here are some photos I was able to grab off of the Kroger website.

# UPDATED INFO FROM THIS MORNING

TTCF is not **OFFICIALLY** in Kroger. Two days ago when I posted this original post, it was all rumor and speculation. They will be fully launched two months from now in September. They will be in 1,800 Kroger locations with **12 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS!** This is huge news and the official press release is shown below.

# NEW PRODUCTS

This company is coming out with new products all of the time. It seems like every month new flavors and styles of food are announced. But you may be asking the question and saying... ""This is just a food company that sells stuff in the freezer isle. What's the big deal?"" Well the company is currently working on expanding past **JUST** the freezer isle. Plant-based tortillas are currently being talked about. Plant-based snacks are also scheduled to come out late 2021/early 2022. A new executive was just hired a few weeks ago who specializes in the snack industry. In the same way boring old PepsiCo was able to expand into dozens of brands and product styles, TTCF would be able to do the same **IF** they continue their success.

# MARKETING EXSPENSES/MARKETING STRATEGIES

Remember the massive growth numbers we talked about for ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products? Well until 2021, the budget for marketing and advertising TTCF products has been **$0.00**. Until this year, **100%** of their growth has been through their own making. **NOT** with a massive marketing budget. Small TV campaigns and mobile ads are being paid for as of the last few months. More importantly, brand ambassadors/influencers will also be sponsoring TTCF as well. Now that advertising will be impacting the company, I expect brand recognition to steadily increase.

# TARGET LAUNCH

**IN THE LAST QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL THE CEO STATED THAT TARGET CLAIMED TATTOOED CHEF WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FROZEN FOOD LAUNCH IN THE HISTORY OF TARGET.** This is obviously huge for the company. Target is already a big deal for this company and this level of confidence from Target is exciting.

# BALANCE SHEET

Going over everything on a balance sheet would make this (already long) post even longer. But I have two main things on the balance sheet I would like to point out. Cash as of 03/31/2021 is $185 Million. Meanwhile, long term debt $1.9 Million. The company currently has almost no debt and is cash loaded. Considering this is a company which has $1.65 Billion market cap, $185 Million is a considerable amount of cash. So technically, the valuation of the company is over 10% strictly in cold, hard cash. This is very appealing.

# TAM OPPORTUNITY (Total Addressable Market)

The total addressable market for TTCF is very large. Virtually anyone who eats food (regardless of dietary lifestyle) are potential customers for TTCF. Plant based, vegan, and vegetarian diets are all growing in popularity (See Below). Plant based foods of had 13% compounded annual growth rate from 2017-2019. These numbers are expected to continue for the next decade.

# POTENTIAL RISKS FOR TTCF

Like all businesses, the company does have many risks. The company is in an extremely competitive market. The food industry will always have big money moving products in and out and competition will continue to be ruthless.

The many retailers TTCF has gotten into could give away the hard earned shelf space. This goes hand and hand with competition risks. If Target, Walmart, Costco, etc. finds a better product, TTCF is at risk of losing the valuable real estate of shelf space.

Sam and Sarah are the backbone of the company. The bulk of shares are owned by them and they are what makes the company the success that it is. If for whatever reason, they were to part ways with the company, it is questionable how successful this business would be.

I believe plant based diets are a trend, not a fad. But, if vegetarian/vegan/plant diets die off in popularity, then Tattooed Chef would likely begin to follow suit as well.

Low margins are kind of the norm for food based businesses. Low margins means less room for error. Profits will likely remain constrained to certain levels for the lifespan of the business.

Inflation has been a big talk in the markets recently and rising costs of raw materials for their products could rise. This could potentially hurt profitability.

Risk free rate of return drives valuation for all equity securities. The risk free rate of return is currently at rock bottom. If this were to change, then stocks with profits that are future oriented would likely see their valuation contract. TTCF falls into this category of valuation contraction.

80,investing,valuescott,Flaws in exploration companies,"TLDR: Most exploration companies are terrible.

This post reflects what I have found after looking at dozens of medium and smaller sized canadian and american exploration companies.  There are a few that look promising - they have some revenue coming in, some attractive operations, maybe even some earnings.  But more often than not, I come across some of these common attributes:

* There is no revenue, and a lot of losses
* They issue more stock each year to offset retained losses and keep liabilities low  
* They have optimistic content on their website, press releases, and anything excluding their finances.
* They may have a lot of assets relative to liabilities - mostly with assets acquired or cash generated as a direct result of huge share issuances.
* They have many years of unprofitable operations, and a history of rebranding.
* They sometimes own or claim land that has some legal, political, regulatory, locational,  or other type of problem.

I have heard that many of these companies are mentioned in social media, and I have seen them recommended in articles, as well as all over reddit.  

Take for example standard lithium ltd (TSXV:SLL).  They have no operations.  Zero.  They have been around for 23 years and still don’t have any actual operations.  If you look at their balance sheet two things pop out at you. They have a lot of assets relative to liability, and they have two massive numbers under equity.  Their share capital is massive, and rising and their deficit (accumulated) is also massive and only increasing.  The income statement solidifies that they are issuing shares - an increase of about 12% in the past year.  Their recent press releases are optimistic, and they make it seem like they have operations by showing processing plants they have, but some deeper research shows that they are destroying a lot of shareholder value every year.

Another case is los andes copper ltd (LA).  They are currently in a legal battle with a community in Chile, and I will let you be the judge of what the legal outcome could be when LA decides to do battle with the Chilean people and their government to get mining permits.  Here is the document provided by the people who live near LA’s claim: [Letter](https://miningwatch.ca/sites/default/files/cartaalpueblodecanadaeningles.pdf?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=b448350a5f76af5368f87ce063d4319cff9b66ee-1626201317-0-AXFv2valzhSwnCpQiSIhbMo2SAIhHoLiZTc9oXNkfwh3OSKKEr13VfPLh6ZsmKsF6Tl6QwAQAgaeynHOom93zUm8xdvtCLXmN21ptH7JkgCTxAXwdG9e89blu_egpn1RCaJX0jhlUt2Y_01755uHiBhj2tOGWd9gO7gKiYzz0vDprZWVbjv04PFyaeghx3e_XbP6dC2CvcKAi7rNCO5bDsSP7tSkfidqbctRedi66KdsopM1QLzo_Y8z0HOwn9uMBskZkHJSglIYtPsbLGoew6WPHAI8RxVelWupCSx_m4fimOy_5n8exl2pxoeKjfpDZrx0h4wzkkDJ1zSg1de7bxZm9CAEF3-s_ncnNM_t9HtwF1CjhvbFCTfS2jrcJdUPFkT1vbJYVQgF1td3YFJXUaJtzDWZqp4rkaB9GL60TjB9I9zScUUv47IK4sZZxRhSaVDNjr9aHewAlH3g3hBWHfk)

And take virginia energy resources, an american company that owns the property above but has consistently been denied the permit to extract the resources.  Their claim has been re-evaluated many times over and gone from tens of millions to under 3M.  Most of their costs over their 14 year existence have been legal, and in that time they have accumulated over 47 Million in accumulated deficit (Mostly from legal fees), issued $50M in equity, and only have a $3M claim.  Who in their right mind spends 16 times what a claim is worth on legal fees to get a permit to extract it?? Certainly not a rational or competent manager.  

There are hundreds of companies like this.  One can only guess at the motives behind someone who promotes one of these companies.  I have decided that when you see someone promoting these companies, they probably fall into these categories:

* Someone who has lost a lot of their investment due to massive dilution and trying to make their money back.
* Someone who is not a long term investor in a company but trying to pump them because they are small.
* Someone who has not done enough research or has been deluded into believing that the company has good prospects.
* Someone who has done very deep analysis and determined that the company may generate some revenue.

As you can see, only the last of these categories has good intentions.  And it is hard to tell the difference between someone with an objectively justified bullish case and someone who is trying to persuade you that the company they are talking about has great potential despite its state of despair.

97,investing,BlurOcean,My boyfriend is angry at me because I convinced him to invest in crypto,"So, he had some money, like 15k USD that was his life savings, and I convinced him to invest in stocks since he wasn't doing nothing with his money.




We were successful during the stocks investments, but we got bored of getting small earnings (like, we could make about almost 10% I guess in one month, so it was small compared to crypto possibilities), I was managing and getting the credit, like ""look what I did? You are getting 4x your retirement salary!"" it was a good amount every month, then the greediness raise and I convinced him to invest in crypto. Bad mistake.




15k USD might sounds not much but we live in Brazil, the exchange rate is 5:1, 15k USD is a good amount of money. And he is also retired due to an accident that slowed him, he now has movement issues but it's not that bad, so he lives with minimum wage due to the being retired at age 23, he did labor work before, he's 29 now.




So shit goes down and now he is 90+% down. We lost everything. LoL I'm so nervous because he does so much pressure on me. Saying that it's all my fault that I convinced him, which it is, I feel so guilty, and the pressure that he does doesn't help at all, I feel anxious all the time, he throws that on my face saying that it's my fault, I feel really bad, he doesn't even treat me the same anymore, what is understandable, It's like he's angry at me, he is probably not seeing myself as someone worth anymore...




The worse part is that his family is super homophobic, they were all telling him that he was going to lose everything, they often threatened me as well saying bad things about me (they don't even know me, never cared to know me lol), and now I feel like he's giving the reason to them ""oh my family warned about this and they were right, I lost everything"". Part of me was like ""I'm going to prove that family wrong"". We were proving them wrong during the stocks investments that was successful, but when we jumped to crypto we lost everything and it sucks... he's also bisexual and kinda religious. Sometimes he says at anger ""this is a punishment, for my sins, they told me"" or something along those lines, he is conflicted, now that things went bad he feels like he's on the wrong way and this is all gods punishment...I mean, I try to open his mind about bible and Christianity, but it's hard to change, he's afraid of god due to the accident lol that sounds kinda crazy but it was a bad accident, he's luck to be alive and well

Basically it was a very strong month for Nvidia as it’s upcoming 4 to 1 dividend split has investors raising price targets across the board, leading to further investment interest and in turn raising the actual price.

And at a 15% gain for the month, I only wish I had purchased a few more shares when the last tech dip occurred. If you remember me saying in one of my recent recap videos, I am still extremely bullish on nvidia in the long term, so while this short term growth is great, I still believe the price point to be a great distance away.

8,investing,Scorface,Advice for a Vanguard Stock ETF Portfolio (25-35 year old),"I am going to start having a blend of Stocks and Bonds in my portfolio.  I'll calculate how much of a percentage of my portfolio should go to stocks and how much should go to bonds later, but for now among the Stocks portion of the portfolio, how should I divide it up among these Vanguard ETFs below:

Should I have it as:

A)
25% VOO - Vanguard's S&amp;P Large-Cap 500
25% IVOO - Vanguard's S&amp;P Mid-Cap 400
25% VIOO - Vanguard's S&amp;P Small-Cap 600
25% VXUS - Vanguard's International Stock

OR

B)
75% VTI - Vanguard's US Stock Market
25% VXUS - Vanguard's International Stock

OR

C)
100% VT - Vanguard's World Stock Market

OR
D) None of the above


I saw a financial advise videos that a well diversified portfolio is a blend of Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap, and International.  Since everybody seems to like the S&amp;P 500 I figured I would have them in with the other two S&amp;P Mid-Cap and Small-Cap funds.  Then I thought well why am I doing all three when I could just have VTI and VXUS.  And then I thought well why have VTI and VXUS when I could just have VT.

16,investing,WrecktheRIC,Which platforms allow for more flexible investing (i.e. investing in cannabis and/or China)?,"  

I'm trying to invest in cannabis and/or China and my current brokerage account is with Wells Fargo. They won't let me invest in these specific sectors because marijuana is not fully legal in the US (so they say, lame) and, regarding China, apparently it must trade on a U.S. stock exchange, so not sure how to get access to stock exchanges beyond what is in the U.S.

I am primarily interested in ETFs for both of these theses because it seems so hard to pick a single specific winner when it comes to relatively early stage investing (as, in my opinion, the cannabis industry is in relatively early days) and China is a relative unknown to me so just trying to harness the overall economic power there without getting too pinpoint specific on which firm or industry/sector.

So, in effect, I really have two overall questions –

(1) how can I get access to these individual stocks or ETFs / which trading platform will allow this? Should I be avoiding bigger banks and going for more app-based trading platforms?

(2) Any stocks or ETFs that folks would recommend in this space? Specifically, for China is there anything you know that does trade on the U.S. exchanges that could be easily accessible and broadly tracks the overall China market?",1626191449,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ojif1y/which_platforms_allow_for_more_flexible_investing/

&gt; The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.9 percent
in June on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.6 percent in May, the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. This was the largest 1-month change
since June 2008 when the index rose 1.0 percent. Over the last 12 months, the
all items index increased 5.4 percent before seasonal adjustment; this was the
largest 12-month increase since a 5.4-percent increase for the period ending
August 2008.

&gt; The index for used cars and trucks continued to rise sharply, increasing 10.5
percent in June. This increase accounted for more than one-third of the
seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index increased 0.8 percent in
June, a larger increase than the 0.4-percent increase reported for May. The
energy index increased 1.5 percent in June, with the gasoline index rising 2.5
percent over the month.

48,investing,Avid_Hiker98,Lockheed Martin (LMT) Due Diligence:,"Long story short, LMT is a $600 stock that is wrongly trading at $380. The simple investment thesis is ""you can only fire a bullet once.""

Lockheed Martin is aerospace and defense company which provides high-end military equipment. Aircraft is where they particularly shine with the F-35 accounting for about 30% of the company's revenue.

The lion's share of the company's revenue comes the united states government. Most of all aircraft used by the USAF comes from this one company.

**CEO INFORMATION**

Lockheed recently announced 2020 a new CEO in 2020 to run the company. His name is Jim Taiclet. While having several years of experience with Lockheed, his previous experience as CEO was not with another defense company.

Most of his career was spent running the successful REIT known as American Tower (AMT). The company has been very successful both during and after his tenure. (Which is another great dividend growth company which shows his experience returning capital and his dedication to increasing shareholder value).

[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/leadership-governance/james-taiclet-joins-lockheed-martin-president-ceo.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/leadership-governance/james-taiclet-joins-lockheed-martin-president-ceo.html)

**DIVIDEND HISTORY/SAHRE BUYBACKS**

Quarterly Payout:

2020 - $2.60

2019 - $2.40

2018 - $2.20

2017 - $2.00

2016 - $1.82

2015 - $1.65

Dividend Yield = 2.68%

Payout Ratio = \~40% (Very Safe)

Let me start be saying that this company is EXTREMELY profitable. The company is currently on an 18 year consecutive dividend streak. Not to mention the company buys back BILLIONS of its own stock year in and year out, with the share count having decreased by 50% since 2009. I fully expect this company to be a dividend aristocrat in a few years.

The dividend yield is about double that of the S&amp;P as of today and only has a Payout Ratio of about 40%. This means that not only does this company have a good yield while buying back stock, but this company can EASILY afford to maintain and RAISE the dividend over time dramatically.

**MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS**

The company has a long history of M&amp;A activity and the most recent example of this Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD). This is yet another example of the company using its financial fortress of a balance sheet and exemplary cash flows to acquire other businesses.

AJRD is a space and aeronautics company which could potentially extend more deals with NASA and the U.S. government. This was recently announced about six months ago in December 2020 and is likely to finalize in 2021.

**FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The company has incredible financials. The balance sheet is a financial fortress. The debt load is very controllable. Cash flows continue to pour in record numbers year after year and 2021 guidance issued by the company expects record revenue and record EPS for the year.

The Biden administration just issued an increase in defense spending of about \~1% earlier this year. All the more reason for this company's financials to continue to stay healthy. Financials linked below....

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/financials?p=LMT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/financials?p=LMT)

**GROWTH STORY MOVING FORWARD**

LMT is expected to grow top-line revenue numbers 4.50% in 2021 and 3.70% in 2022. Earnings per share for the company in 2020 finished at $24.58. This is expected to grow to $26.68 in 2021 and $27.90 in 2022.

Contracts are usually signed many years in advance. Revenues can be easily forecasted for the next several years due to the timelines of the contracts. Furthermore, innovation is not only encouraged, but expected by shareholders AND the united states military is order for our nation to maintain relevant in terms of weaponry.

New age military equipment is usually pretty ""hush-hush"" on what is in the works but Lockheed Martin does disclose some of these new products including technologies such as new highly intelligent drones, missile systems, and even targeted lasers.

One thing is for sure, the military will continue come out with bigger and more powerful weapons as time goes on. Who will likely be selling it to them? Probably good ole LMT.

Newer acquisitions such as the recent AJRD deal allows Lockheed to also focus on other products in the space category and is another wildcard with some potential.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT)

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE/ BARRIER TO ENTRY**

The regulations are incredibly strict. The demand for capital is VERY HIGH with projects frequently running into the billions of dollars. Switching from one business to another poses risks for the government and our military and are usually avoided.

This makes the U.S. government very loyal and sticky to LMT business and this is very likely to continue. While there are competitors in the space....Lockheed continues to dominate this market.

**VALUATION (WHY IT'S A GREAT BUY IMO)**

As mentioned earlier, the company is expected to produce $27.90 in EPS in 2022. Based of of today's price of $390, this gives this company a forward PE ratio of \~13.9. This is an *EXTREMELY low forward PE* ratio for a company putting up record numbers and dominating the market that it operates in.

This is even more impressive considering it's still off a fair amount from it's previous all time highs. I am very bullish and this is one of my largest positions. I am not remotely interested in selling. I am buying at these prices or really anything even close to these levels. I wouldn't sell a share if this company were to go to $800 a share tomorrow morning.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT)

**RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER**

Almost all revenue comes from one customer (the government). It is steady and consistent but if the government were to fall out of love with Lockheed then this company would be negatively impacted.

There aren't many who could take down LMTs throne but their main competitor is Boeing. Boeing has the capital and leverage to compete with Lockheed Martin long term.

This company is susceptible to a number of different geopolitical risks. Conflicts with other countries could be both a Negative AND a positive for Lockheed.

54,investing,realbeats,UK Investment Funds to research,"TLDR: This isn't my list of UK funds to research but I'm asking for any that you have interest in that would be worth me looking at. 

...

In particular this comes because alot of the talk we see on reddit is about US funds / ETF's which can have additional tax implications for us as foreign investors. 

I do my long term investing through an Investment ISA so its tax free and so I want to stick to funds that can take advantage of that.

As an example when alot of people would talk about using SPY as an S&amp;P 500 tracker the one I'm in is:

UBS GBL ASSET MGT SP 500 INDEX C ACC NAV

Very happy with it over all, but when we see suggestions of index tracker funds etc often I have to then research for the closest available to mirror of whats being spoken about. VTI is another example, Vanguard UK does have similar products but you don't buy into the same fund. 

So I just wondered if specifically the Brits had index tracker funds (not just S&amp;P 500) or other funds that they particularly liked and that I could easily read a bit more about, I'm just wanting to diversify a bit and with the impending inflation and doom and gloom of pull backs and housing bubbles etc. Be nice to have a list to research.

- Potentially this could have been put in the daily thread but as its UK specific I thought I'd make a fresh post, sorry mods if you'd rather it was there.",1626167858,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ojbwjz/uk_investment_funds_to_research/

Originally I was planning to wait it out til past earnings to see if things will eventually cool down or not.  I am hoping for the market to gradually lose a little steam rather than crash, but that’s always a possibility. 

With those concerns in mind, I was looking into ETFS with downside protection. 

Two that I’ve been looking into specifically are BUFF (an etf made from buffer ETFs) and SPYC, a “convex” etf that buys OTM puts to protect against bigger corrections.

I’ve been going through earnings transcripts just to see if there’s any thematic stuff they report quarter over quarter they don’t include in the investor fact book.

3. Pocket the 300K and invest in an index fund or possibly have someone manage it

Option 1 means I get to keep valuable Northern Virginia property which always does well. Additionally, I get to keep my home and it’s sentimentality. 

If I go with option 2, I’m thinking of buying property in Florida near the theme parks and have a management company run it as a short term rental. I’ll have a place to stay when I visit the states. Other option would be to buy my retirement home early (mountain cabin, lake house, or something?) and rent it out. Where would you buy? What are your strategies? 

With option 3, I could cash out at the height of a hot real estate market and not have to worry about being a landlord.",1626134186,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oj3pgx/with_an_extra_300k_would_you_invest_in_an_index/

23,investing,valuescott,The risks associated with goodwill,"Goodwill is the present value of the excess paid for businesses representing acquired intangible assets.  The first time I heard of it was a number of years ago in a business class, but the real risks associated with it have taken a while to resonate.  I was recently going over a company that looked great.  Their profit margins are good, revenue is stable, expenses are somewhat predictable and most of the Wall Street ratios were better than satisfactory.  But when it came to the balance sheet, I noticed that a quarter of assets were goodwill.

This may mean absolutely nothing to you or it may sound alarm bells in your head.  Goodwill generally does not represent something you can buy or sell, and when you can buy or sell it there are usually abstract estimations of its value.  Very occasionally can a goodwill item actually have an accurate number associated with it on the value it might be sold at.  Some examples of goodwill items are patents, relationships, and talent.

Goodwill must be depreciated over 40 or less years.  Other than that, the values produced are first tied to the business acquisition costs and then more tied to the opinions of auditors and internal accountants. 

My old corporate finance textbook recommends that when analyzing the balance sheet, try removing goodwill​​ and maybe the same value from shareholders equity and see what it does to the company's overall health.  It may be a decisive factor in reducing your exposure to risk and financial heartache.  This correlation between goodwill and shareholders equity is entirely fictional because goodwill is not attributable to SHE directly, but the exercise may nonetheless make the company look much more risky.  For the company I was looking at, it certainly made a difference.

The company I was looking at when I came across these figures was Clorox if you would like to see for yourself.  The figures are from year end 2020.",1626063321,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oijsyk/the_risks_associated_with_goodwill/

We all have seen heavy manipulation and shorting of SAVA the last months and year(s). Often assumed that there might be illegal actions behind the scene by MM/shorts/funds to manipulate the stock price in their favour.
But since last Friday we might have a documented indication that they break law/SEC regulation to benefit from manipulated stock!!

A hit piece appeared on STAT about FDA investigation in their Biogen AD drug approval (among others by Adam Feuerstein, who is said to be a mean of funds to write hit pieces to influence stock prices in favor of funds).
Benzinga then wrote ""Cassava Sciences Shares Fall Sharply Lower After STAT News Reports 'FDA calls for federal investigation into  controversial Alzheimer's drug approval'""
Well, SAVA was up 10% during the day and at the point of time of the Benzinga article was still up 2% on its remarkable comeback to all time high after takedown in Feb.
Then orchestrated heavy shorting of more than a million shares started immediately and took the stock down to -10% for the day. 
After the damage was done, they changed the title of the article to ""Cassava Sciences Shares Fall Sharply Lower After STAT News Reports 'FDA calls for federal investigation into [Biogen's] controversial Alzheimer's drug approval'"" 

All well described in the video above.

Their goal is to cover huge short positions cheaper, enter the stock before end of July cheaper and above all let July options expire worthless.

Well, in anticipation of very good 9 months open label data, I'm not scared in the mid and long run, but just wanted to provide some information to you so that everyone can make his/her own picture. If this manipulation holds true, this is an unacceptable example of human greed which attacks a company which could be the biggest lever to bring relief to one of the ugliest diseases of the world.

Many also filed SEC complaints already under https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html

Decide yourself on your reaction. Either filing a SEC complaint, doing nothing or buy heavy to let all shorts feel the real pain and not let July options expire worthless end of next week.

I am long with no options. And expect a bright future ahead of SAVA. But please do your own due diligence!",1626045558,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oif1a5/sava_likely_hit_by_illegal_means_to_take_the/
82,investing,somalley3,Can risk parity work as an investment strategy with near-zero interest rates?,"I wrote my final paper in my Advanced Investments class last semester on Bridgewater’s all-weather portfolio and, more specifically, their risk parity approach within that portfolio, and it was very fascinating to study this innovative strategy that so uniquely distinguished legendary investor Ray Dalio and his hedge fund Bridgewater in the 1980’s. 
Here’s a quick definition of risk parity per investopedia: 
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-parity.asp

The risk parity approach to portfolio construction seeks to allocate investment capital on a risk-weighted basis to optimally diversify investments, viewing the risk and return of the entire portfolio as one.
The risk parity approach builds off of modern portfolio theory (MPT) but allows for the use of leverage and short selling.
Risk parity requires a great deal of quantitative calculation, which makes its allocations more advanced than simplified allocation strategies.

For those interested in learning more, here’s Bridgewater’s white paper on the all-weather portfolio: 
https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/the-all-weather-story

Basically, the essence of it involves using large amounts of leverage to smooth out risk disparities between say stocks and bonds. Since stocks have higher historical return deviations they’re seen as being more risky, but you can use leverage to elevate the returns of bonds such that they mirror the risk level of equities with a different set of inverse correlations (hence making the portfolio robust to different macro circumstances depending on whether stocks were rising and bonds falling as the economy recovers or stocks falling and bonding rising during downturns). There’s a lot more nuance to this, especially considering various inflationary environments and incorporating real assets but that is the overall gist.

Notably though, the risk-parity approach gas come under heat in recent years for not performing as well as expected for a number of reasons such as bonds having a downside asymmetry since they cannot appreciate significantly more without producing negative yields (which has happened in Europe but the Fed has expressed an interest in avoiding in the U.S) and correspondingly a reduction in the inverse correlation between stocks and bonds (last march both treasuries and equities sold off during a liquidity crunch rather than bonds serving as a safe haven which they eventually did largely due to help from the Fed).

Dalio has famously written books and essays on what he refers to as the long term debt cycle where monetary standards are set after the changing of a world order, in this case following world war 2 with the emergence of U.S global supremacy. In these cycles reserve currencies ultimately rely on monetary polciy increasingly to offset economic downturns until rates cannot be lowered anymore, which is essentially where we are now.

So, all that being said, do you all believe that the inverse correlation between stocks and bonds is set to deteriorate thus yielding  risk parity portfolios and even 60/40 portfolios massively over exposed to risk? Or will can rates keep falling and reach negative territory? Could it be possible that the portfolio theory can be modified to adjust risk for something other than bonds and yield the same success? Would love to hear some thoughts and debate",1626024725,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oi8rp2/can_risk_parity_work_as_an_investment_strategy/

In the ""Potential Next Steps"" section, if any of these activities would result in any negative tax/fee consequences, please let me know. Any advice/recommendations would be greatly appreciated. 

Current Picture:
Age: 29
Current Salary: $93,000 + 8% bonus (on average)
$47,000 Roth IRA with Betterment (90% stocks, 10% bonds, conributed the max amount since 2016)
$115,000 in employer 401k with Fidelity, up until 2 month ago I was contributing 6% to Roth 401k with a 3% employer match to Traditional 401k, I am now contributing 10% to Roth and 15% to Traditonal with 3% employer match (100% invested in FID FREEDOM 2060 FVTKX, .5 ER)
$2,000 in checking account
$200,000 in savings account (I know, I know, this is way too much to have in a savings account. I bought a house and got married within the last year and a half and wasn't sure how much cash I was going to need to have readily available at the time.)

Potential Next Steps:
Rollover $47,000 Roth IRA from Betterment to Fidelity and put 100% into Fidelity Freedom Index 2060 Fund-Investor Class (FDKLX)
Transfer $50,000 from saving account to brokerage account with Fidelity and put 100% into Fidelity Total Market Index Fund (FSKAK)
Should I change my asset allocation in my 401k?

21,investing,rarelywearamask,Invest your entire Social Check in the stock market? Better to start at age 62 or 70?,"A friend of mine- who retired early at age 60- is well off and does not really need the money from Social Security.  So he plans to apply for SS and invest each monthly check in the stock and bond market and give the proceeds to his children at his death.  The question is should he start collecting at age 62 or wait till 70 and get the largest monthly check.

For the sake of argument, he said he plans to live to age 90.  So if he collected Social Security at age 62 he would collect 336 smaller monthly checks for 28 years.  If he waited until 70 to collect SS he would collect 240 larger monthly checks for 20 years.

I found this was fascinating math and investing question.  So I did some calculations from the historical stock market records.  I used both a total stock market fund and a balanced mutual fund (Vanguard Wellington (VWELX) that has been in operation since the 1930s.

I assumed the ""collect at age 62 monthly check"" to be $2000 a month and a collect starting at age 70 check of $4000.00.  Each would increase each year for inflation.  My findings:  **There has never been a situation where someone would come out ahead in any starting point waiting till 70 to collect if they die at age 90.**  **Either with a total stock market fund or a balanced mutual fund.** Check it out on this website:

42,investing,valuescott,Back testing growth predictons,"TLDR at bottom

I decided to try a back testing experiment where I would look at current and recent operations of a company ($GIL: Gildan) and come up with my own five year estimates for growth taking into account quantitative and qualitative factors.  The process was to look at old financials and come up with my judgement.  I have never analyzed $GIL before and I knew nothing about their financial state past or present. I read their annual reports in order from oldest to newest in order to maintain an unbiased opinion.

I know that some of you will point out that I could have just said that I did this in order to make me look smart by having accurate growth estimates.  I assure you that the point of this post is to highlight the discrepancies between predictions and reality, and hopefully add something to your investing toolbox for you to think about.

**Ten years ago analysis:**

**(2011)** The balance sheet has a good structure.  Current assets along can cover all liabilities quite easily.  Debts are not a problem.  There has been recent sales and earnings with good profit margins hovering around 10%.  Operating cash flow is generating consistent cash flow.  Net cash flow was negative attributable to a large business acquisition so this year net cash flow was negative but on average could be expected to reach 100M annually.

Acquisitions:

* The business they acquired was a sock supplier for 350M at a net asset premium of 137M.
* They also spent 15M on 12M assets on a vertically integrated T-Shirt manufacturing facility in Bangladesh.

Inventories are mostly finished goods (About 80% are finished goods) with the remainder being materials, spare parts, and partially finished goods.  Manufacturing equipment is about half of PPE and increased by 100M in the last year.  Goodwill increased by roughly the value excess of assets in the acquisitions.  They have an 800M RLOC with 209M drawn @ 2.3%.

Based on their past income statement data, I would not say it is unreasonable to expect 100M in revenue growth per year over the next five years.  They have increased sales by 300M per year, but to stay conservative I will use the figure of 100M YoY or about 5%. Earnings and OCF will follow this trend.  The balance sheet will stay strong, hopefully with the same structure of assets as we see now. Depending on their appetite, debt may increase if they keep up with large acquisitions.

What actually happened:

2016:

\-Current assets went up about 500M, or about 60%.  Overall assets increased by 1B

\- Liabilities doubled, Retained earnings increased by about 50%

\- Sales increased by about 1.3B, or 250M per year. Overall increase of about 12% yearly

\- Earnings increased by about 4% yearly.  OCF increased by about 50%, or 8% YoY.

Their financial health got stronger overall.  Sales and OCF did much better than expected, and earnings slightly underperformed.  The operating environments during this period were quite good.  The world economy was experiencing growth after the financial meltdown in 2008 that was above average.

**Five years ago analysis:**

**(2016)** The balance sheet has good structure.  Current assets are almost double liabilities.  Most current assets are inventory. Assuming that of these only finished products will be converted into cash and receivables nets 640M, which still covers all liabilities.  The company is on track to have almost no need for debt.  Sales are large compared to the balance sheet, and profit margins are and have been above 10%.  OCF is good, but ideally this number would be about 20% larger to cover current asset requirements with a larger debt coverage margin of safety.

They recently acquired a shirt manufacturer for 112M with 14M goodwill.  They also paid 102M for the assets + 26M goodwill in a lingerie company, the first acquisition of this sort.

It would be reasonable to say that revenue can grow by about 250M per year or about 8% YoY. This is about half of the growth seen in the recent two years, so it is considered a conservative estimate.  Net income will likely trail this trend by 20-30% earnings growth has been slightly slower than revenue growth.  Earnings growth can be estimated to be 4-5% YoY, and OCF could follow this closely.  If they manage money right, total liabilities could shrink to ⅓ of total assets in the coming years, although debt may rise as a number if they continue their current acquisition habits.

What actually happened:

2021:

* Sales are at 2B, about a 35% decrease from 2016
* Net income is -220M
* Operating cash flow have decreased by 40%
* All three of my predicted growth rates were useless.  Revenue from 2019 year end was also much lower than the growth rates would have dictated.
* Instead of selling more shears, they issued one billion in debt payable over the next six years with an average interest rate of 2.8%

It is clear that in periods of stable growth, it is much easier to be optimistic. Who would have been able to predict the pandemic? Certainly not me.  But that is not an excuse for being wrong.  This was a very interesting activity for me to do, and hopefully this can serve as a reminder that predictions and reality can very possibly have zero correlation.  The low growth in 2019 was not related to the pandemic, further proving that predictions - your own or from others or even professionals - have the possibility of being dangerously wrong.

TLDR:I tried to look at really old financials and predict what would happen in the companies near future.  It worked well from 2011-2016, but completely failed between 2016-2021.",1625975242,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ohx82a/back_testing_growth_predictons/

78,investing,valuescott,What high interest rates COULD mean for different industries,"This is all my own opinion, but I did some deep research into each industry and tried to make this post as objective as possible.  I hope you get something out of this!

&amp;#x200B;

In general:  In high interest rates, bonds do better and stocks do worse than in lower interest rates.  High interest rates means more difficulty growing. It also implies the risk free rate is high so bond yields must rise with it in order to have any demand for corporate paper.

Basic Materials:

The interest rate to commodity price index is inverted.  This is because the demand for commodities falls with the level of economic activity.  This can be seen quite clearly by comparing a chart of interest rates with commodity prices.

The implications of high interest rates are divided across the industry.  Commodity producers will have more difficulty staying profitable and expanding operations.  Cash generation will be severely strained.  Commodity buyers on the other hand will find that expenses are much lower and it easier to get competitive prices.  There are some material producers that will suffer less than others.  In general, smaller companies suffer more because the larger ones are more capable of providing the most competitive prices.

Communication services:

Communications services do well in low interest rates, and tend to struggle in higher rates.  This sector is generally the most overpriced and most leveraged.  Stock prices in this sector may decrease more than the average market does.  In addition to lower stock prices, companies that require a lot of leverage will have difficulty expanding or continuing operations.  Established companies that have less capital intensive operations will fare much better, but still won’t be able to come up with the same revolutionary technologies that come from lower interest rate environments.

Technology:

This sector is unique because it is much newer and has not been exposed to high interest rates.  If the current environment of startups are extended, many startups will find difficulty finding funding and small companies with high debt will face similar problems.  For larger companies, a unique situation is presented.  These companies are known for constant acquisitions and with high interest rates, all of the talent in niche tech businesses will suddenly look much more attractive.

It is possible that the mega cap tech companies will be nearly unaffected because of their massive operating cash flows that are vital to normal life.  Many companies in tech have become very large with a low interest rate for the entirety of their existence.  It is possible that these companies suffer more than older companies of similar operations and size because of a lack of experience operating at higher interest rates.

Industrials:

These companies have mixed implications.  On one end, commodities and other material input are cheaper, but on the other end there is less demand for industrial products in an economic slowdown.  Revenue and cost of goods sold could be expected to decrease, creating smaller, more profitable businesses.

A nice way to think about this is to examine the airplane manufacturing industry in a high interest rate environment.  The manufacturer can acquire the materials and possibly prefabs for the plane for cheaper.  The gross margin on the individual plane is higher as a result, but in the general economy, consumer activity is lower, so there is less traveling and a resulting lower demand for aircraft.

Health Care:

Health care is much less volatile than the average market because the demand for healthcare services is mostly disjoint from economic activity.  The main concerns in health care are shared with the rest of the economy - mostly issues arising in debt refinancing and upgrading or acquiring fixed assets.

Utilities:

Utilities generally underperform in high interest rates.  They take on more debt, require consistent servicing of fixed assets, and are slower to increase revenue than other industries.  When operating conditions are staying similar (utility costs for consumers are not increasing much) and interest rates are high, utilities have a much more difficult time covering capex and depreciation.

Consumer staples:

Consumer staples are historically less volatile than most of the market.  Consumers may not be buying luxury goods or a second home at high interest rates, but like healthcare, consumer staples are not things that are optional for most people.  \[Most?\] Consumers are not going to stop purchasing food and toiletries just because their variable rate debts are becoming more costly.

Finance:

Finance tends to do well in high interest rate environments.  They are able to write higher rate loans, and demand for loans increases.  Insurance historically issued higher premiums.  Financial firms can be viewed as the most obvious beneficiaries of high interest rates at the cost of most other industries.",1625949174,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ohqbl5/what_high_interest_rates_could_mean_for_different/

* San Jose water company provides water to 231 000 connections in san jose
* SJWNE has water companies in the northeast. They have 139 000 connections
* SJWTX provides 20 000 connections in Texas
* SJW Land owns land and develops it in Tennessee

1 connection can supply 1 standalone structure.  They serve about 1.54 Million people.

They have been acquiring some utility companies recently.  They also in a way get to determine the price of water.  This year they have made a request to increase their prices by 3%.  Because the Mexican government has been burning water, there will be less and less water each year because the Mexican government is burning water.

I am extremely bullish $SJW.  Their financial health is completely disjoint from the regular economy.

They have revenue growth and never had negative earnings in the past 15 years.  Profit margins have been at least 20% over the past two decades and are at around 40% YTD. Their current debt structure is not sustainable, but It is looking much more manageable in the future.  They have also consistently been increasing their operating cash flows.  They have a lot of debt issues right now.  This is throwing off the D/E and current ratios.  Wall Street hates to see some of these values when they check their ratios so the stock is at a lower price than it should be and is being overlooked by the institutions.

I don't know shit about stock. I've looked up the businesses name on the SEC Business lookup (""censored name LLC"") and couldn't find anything. Is the owner committing fraud? If so, is there any way to report this?

I'm not sure what hoops need to be jumped through to issue stock certificates as an LLC. But surely you can't valuate your own company at TEN MILLION dollars and start selling stock to vulnerable people with the claim of it 10x-ing. It seems so screwed up.

7,investing,Imboni,Benjamin Graham's followers often state that a market always converges on the intrinsic value of a business long-term. Is it always true though? Looking to discuss conceptually.,"Howard Marks has said that if you are right in the long run but it takes too long, it is indistinguishable from being wrong.

To add to this, there are always exceptions to the rule. If the rule is that the market is indeed a finely turned weighing machine in the long run, there will always be exceptions to the rule.

Moreover, there is no time scale provided. Some consider 5 years long term, some a decade.

So from a conceptual perspective, while it is clear that the market doesn't always converge on intrinsic value due to logically there always being exceptions to the rule, what principles do investors have to distinguish what is an exception to the rule and what isn't?

This is difficult as something might appear to be an exception but may not be, or vice-versa.

20,investing,MrAirborne,Joining on the trend of correction/crash posts,"I am not a smart person when it comes to stock investing. I have a gambling account where I mess around with stocks that are higher risk. I have an account where I buy local stocks that I like as in Central Texas businesses that I do business with. 
I have other accounts that are a bunch of mutual and index funds. Most of my investments are done through businesses ownership and rental properties. I followed the way of the Boomers as GenX. I read the millionaire next door decades ago and Rich Dad Poor Dad and said “I can do that” and I did. 

I want to point out a couple of things. I fully believe that all of the signs of a major correction are here. But that is not a bad thing. I go into this correction knowing that my networth will probably triple. 

Boomers have been luck and now they are dying. Their generation had some fantastic post war to today timing. I could point out every event and how Boomers were really financially able to take advantage of that event. 

If you are lucky with timing then you don’t have to be particularly smart to do well. 

Boomers are dying off so fast that I believe that millenials now out number them or will soon. GenX was a sandwich generation that was denied management positions long past our prime because Boomers stuck around in management far longer than they should have. 

What does this have to do with a correction/crash?

Well, Boomers have not invested like an elderly generation that is currently exiting this world. They were very lucky that they have had the 2010-2021 Bull Run in their golden years. They are still heavily invested in stocks and have far more risk than their parents did.

With the correction coming they will start moving their money to investments that they should have had their money in years ago. They will be the primary mover in the market and retirement funds will be the second major movers. 

They will look to trim risk and weather a correction. 

This will lead to the correction being leveraged and making the deltas larger than they should have been. However, this is an opportunity. Boomers for the first time are going to be the leaders in creating opportunities for other generations. Sudden massive movements towards risk mitigation is going to put many great stocks on sale. Undervalued stocks that are the victims of this migration.

Boomers are going to sell you their stocks at a discount and they will take the financial hit. They are terrified of hyper inflation because they are the ones that will lose the most. Fixed incomes are going to be the meat shields of hyper inflation. They know that.

Boomers by and large will exit into safer options will never come back to the market like they were in the past.

I am going to buy during the boomer fire sale. I am going to reach deep and buy their stocks, buy their rental properties, and buy anything else of theirs that will make me money. 

I have zero doubt that on the backside of this correction I will be far wealthier.

31,investing,rarelywearamask,People say that they live on the stock dividends and don't touch the principal--- really?,"On nearly every investment board on the Internet are tons of people who swear that they have the perfect plan for a guaranteed funded retirement.  Here is their foolproof plan:

**They live on the stock dividends and don't touch the principal.**

Is this genius or just ill-informed?  I vote ill-informed because if you spend the dividends paid by the stock investments you are in fact spending the principal.  People assume that stock dividends are like bank interest where you are getting extra money every month/quarter above and beyond the value of your portfolio.  This is wrong!  Stock dividends are not like getting bank account interest.

**When a dividend is paid, the cash paid to each shareholder is deducted from the cash held by the company. This reduces the book value of the company when it pays you a dividend. Therefore, the value of the company is reduced every time it pays a dividend. In addition, when a dividend is paid, the stock price of the company is automatically adjusted by the stock market by the amount of the dividend. Therefore, in our example, if the company pays a $1.00/share dividend, then the stock price would automatically adjust from $100/share to $99/share after the dividend is paid. The same would drop would occur in the book value of the company.** 

So when you withdraw the dividend payment from your account and spend it, the value of your portfolio is down the same as if you did a scheduled withdrawal of the same percentage as the dividend payment.

WASHINGTON, July 7 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday said further fiscal support in the United States could fuel inflationary pressures and warned that the risk of a sustained rise in prices could require raising interest rates earlier-than-expected.

Higher U.S. interest rates, in turn, could lead to a sharp tightening of global financial conditions and significant capital outflows from emerging and developing economies, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a blog published Wednesday with the IMF's surveillance note for G20 countries.

The IMF's assessment of U.S. inflation risks comes amid sharp criticism by Republican lawmakers of President Joe Biden's multi-trillion-dollar plans to boost spending on infrastructure, child care, community college tuition and expanded coverage of home care for the elderly and disabled.

Georgieva said an accelerated recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, where growth is seen reaching 7% in 2021, would benefit many countries through increased trade, but rising inflation could be more sustained than expected. The IMF forecasts global growth of 6%.

Other countries face rising commodity and food prices, which are now at their highest level since 2014, putting millions of people at risk of food insecurity, the IMF said in its report.

Market expectations suggested commodity prices would remain contained over the next few years, but inflation developments varied within advanced economies and were picking up more rapidly in Britain, the United States and the euro area, while remaining subdued in others, like Japan.

The IMF said the global economic outlook remained uncertain given questions about the evolution of the pandemic and progress on vaccinations, as well as the possibility that the pickup in inflation would prove ""more persistent"" than expected.

""While further fiscal support in some major advanced economies, including the United States, would benefit growth more broadly, it could also further fuel inflationary pressures,"" the IMF said.

A more sustained increase in prices could necessitate earlier-than-expected tightening of U.S. monetary policy, which could hit emerging and developing economies particularly hard, widening the divergence in recovery prospects.

Georgieva repeated her call for urgent action by the G20 countries to accelerate vaccinations to high-risk populations, warning of a ""worsening two-track recovery"" that is leaving a large number of countries behind while the United States, China, the euro area and a few others are recovering quickly.

Acting quickly could save more than half a million lives in the next six months alone, she said. The IMF was working with the World Bank and other institutions to move forward on its $50 billion plan to end the pandemic, she said, arguing that quicker progress could result in trillions of dollars of added global economic output.

The IMF urged countries to continue accommodative monetary policies, while closely monitoring inflation and financial stability risks. In countries where the recovery was accelerating, such as the United States, it would be ""essential"" to avoid overreacting to transitory increases in inflation, Georgieva said.",1625810059,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ogpbzx/imf_chief_sees_risk_of_sustained_rise_in_us/

68,investing,Bobyjoyride,I’ve seen several post worries about a market crash- mostly new investors who are worried they bought the top. Here is one way to play a crash for whom it concerns,"1 almost all the time people are predicting the next crash 

2 know what your investing in~preferably a company you know and use that is steadily showing an increase in cash flow ~ a solid company then how the market moves shouldn’t matter. The price of the stock shouldn’t even matter. You own a part of a great company.

3 use the power of DCA ( dollar cost averaging) with this strategy you buy consistently every week - month - or day. This will minimize the effect of volatility on your portfolio. 

4 DIVIDENDS. often good established companies will pay you a portion of their profits. By reinvesting these you can grow your share count. Using ETFs like SCHD or JEPI create cash flow in your portfolio quarterly and monthly. When 
The market begins to fall you are all ready accumulating more shares at discount prices. These newly acquired shares will also pay you dividends creating a snowball effect. 

5 if you can add more than your dca purchases then save it as a cash or bond position In your portfolio. This will allow you to go on a spending spree when the market crashes to buy more of your shares you picked out in (see “2”).

6 recent US history 1973+ has shown that during market turn downs the fed will try and create an artificial floor under the market. You can benefit from this buy purchasing gold and silver or mining companies. This always works as an inflation play. Ray Dalio suggest to keep ~7% in precious metals. Another inflation play would be commodities such as oil or oil companies or lumber etc….

7 I don’t not suggest buying or using these. OPTIONS. You can sell calls or buy puts when expecting crashes. If I had to chose one I would sell calls and re buy them when the stock drops for a lower premium and poker the difference. With put options I think the risk is greater. I won’t go into detail here on what options are.

I have been trying to understand what would happen if the economy is gone into a recession?

Are we looking at potentially -3-4% rates? I find it a bit mind numbing as inflation is on the rise and loads of talks about a possible ‘crash’. But if the no 1 solution for recession is lowering the interest rates, how could it be applied in current already zero-ish environment. Inflation is going to reduce value of money and on top we would give banks money to keep our money…cant see that helping anything!

My wife and I just found out that we will be having our first child in March and I decided that I would like to start allocating funds to a college fund now.  I’ve always heard that 529’s are the way to go, however, we live in the state of CA where contributions are not deductible at the state or federal level. My questions are as follows:

1) Would I be better off shopping around other states 529 plan (I’ve heard that Ohio and Wisconsin’s are good) and is there any issues in being a resident of one state while investing in a different states plan?

2) Are there any ways to transfer funds from an index fund to a 529 and avoid taxation (I’m pretty sure there aren’t) or should I simply start from scratch given that I have nearly 20 years to build this fund.

3) Am I better off simply investing the funds into our current investment vehicles and allocating the funds as needed as the child gets to that point or are there better options than a 529.

4) suggested income % to be investing each month? As much as possible or is there a good rule to go by? We already save a substantial portion of our income (have around 200k in index funds, 300k in 401ks and own our own house with around 125k in equity).

I've been investing for a few years, and am by no means an expert but wanted to get some opinions on trimming positions once a stock has gone on a pretty nice run.

I am sitting at about an 18% gain on my Apple position and am wondering if it would be prudent to trim my positions to take some profits now?

I also do not need the money right now at all, so I am wondering if given this, is trimming any position always a good idea once that particular stock has gone on a nice little run. 

The only advantage I can think of trimming is taking those profits and investing them in something else, while still holding onto Apple. Although, I can't think of many more companies I have more faith in than Apple right now and still think it will climb higher.

Schwab and other resources published information about the company's dividend, which was paid once annually together with the record date and dividend payable date. This information continued to be published even after the dividend payable date passed. Unfortunately the information was inaccurate. I only learned this after the payable date passed and no money was deposited into my account. I then contacted Schwab and they advised that there would be no dividend paid as the company had cancelled their dividend. GREAT WORK on Schwab's part. The company was $WPP and the dividend was over $2.00 at the time. 

Has anyone else had something like this happen to them? It just never sat well with me that Schwab just turned and said to me, ""Not our problem"". SMH",1625761693,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ogargy/incorrect_info_about_dividend/

This company has seen an SI recently of 200%+. Dropped some and went back up. Now its SI continues to rise along with its PPS.

The SI on MRIN is out of this world yet all I see are people talking about $carv and numerous other stocks with much lower SI.

Keep in mind that GME hit $483 with a 140% SI I believe. SO what do you think will happen with $MRIN?

53,investing,Zilllnaijaboy99,Nancy Pelosi’s Husband Locked In $5.3 Million From Alphabet Options," 

Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, won big on [Alphabet Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US) stock and added bets on [Amazon.com Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMZN:US) and [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US) in the weeks leading up to the House Judiciary Committee’s vote on antitrust legislation that seeks to severely limit how these companies organize and offer their products.

In a financial disclosure signed by Nancy Pelosi July 2, her husband reported exercising call options to acquire 4,000 shares of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, at a strike price of $1,200. The trade netted him a $4.8 million gain, and it’s risen to $5.3 million since then as the shares have jumped.

The transaction was completed just a week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced six bipartisan antitrust bills, four of which take aim at Google, Amazon, Apple and [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) Market reaction was muted, suggesting that investors don’t see the House proposals as a real threat to the companies. Alphabet’s share price has increased 3.2% since the judiciary panel approved the legislation.

[Key Takeaways: Tech’s Nightmare Bills Get Support and Blowback](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QV826CDWLU6A)

Paul Pelosi on May 21 also bought 20 call options for Amazon with a strike price of $3,000, expiring in June 2022, suggesting that he expects the online retailer to continue its gains. He also bet on Apple, purchasing 50 call options with the same expiration date and a strike price of $100.

“The speaker has no involvement or prior knowledge of these transactions,” her spokesman Drew Hammill said in an emailed statement on Wednesday, adding that Speaker Pelosi doesn’t own any stock.

 

In fact, Nancy Pelosi last month said she supports the Judiciary committee’s bipartisan effort to challenge the hold that big technology companies have over the internet economy, telling reporters that Congress is “not going to ignore the consolidation that has happened and the concern that exists on both sides of the aisle.” She said Congress’s responsibility is to “the consumer and competition.”

The six antitrust bills, especially the four that target a narrow set of companies, have a long road to become law. Pelosi’s top deputy, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, said the legislation needs work before getting a vote in the full House. And the Senate presents an even tougher hurdle, where support from at least 10 Republicans is required to pass.

Paul Pelosi made his fortune in real estate and venture capital in the San Francisco area. His transactions are not suspected of violating any laws regarding members of Congress, their spouses and insider trading.

Disclosure reports must be filed within 30 days that lawmakers are aware of a transaction, or no more than 45 days after the transaction took place, [according](https://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/documents/Periodic%20Transaction%20Report%20%28PTR%29%20Form.pdf) to House guidelines.

Carl Icahn, George Soros, Peter Lynch, Peter Thiel, Bill Miller, Jim Rogers, and Guo Guangchang studied philosophy at the university. Icahn says that studying philosophy of the XXI prepares you for acquisitions; Peter Lynch in One Up on Wall Street assures that history and philosophy are the best preparations for investment than mathematics and statistics, and that his courses in logic and philosophy were the ones that helped him the most; Jim Rogers recommends studying history and philosophy in college; Dan Loeb says that to be a good investor you have to be a bit of a philosopher.

David Abrams, Terry Smith, James Anderson, and Nick Train majored in history. Paul Singer and Leon Levy studied psychology. Steinhardt specialized in sociology. Stanley Druckenmiller studied English. Bill Ackman studied Social Sciences. David Einhorn and Stephen Mandel studied Government.

There appears to be a pattern of lean towards the social sciences and the liberal arts. I personally want to pursue asset management professionally, and after reading the advice and suggestions of those I admire, I plan to study philosophy at university.

1,investing,BringATwenty,"Will Zillow's TEN YEAR LONG TURD OF FRAUD come to an end on July 20, 2021","10  years ago, on July 20, 2011 Zillow went public on NASDAQ. No big deal. Now days companies are taken public and raise billions in a puffed up IPO before they even have anything to sell. (CANOO) Since then Zillow has thrived on selling junk ""leads"" to real estate agents across  the country. It might not have been like that at first but what Zillow hasn't told real estate agents for the past few years is that nowdays any contact from anyone to Zillow in Zillow's 10 year history can be disguised by Zillow's quota bots as a ""hot lead"" and batched with 30 or so other random contacts as ""hot leads"" and then sold to gullible real estate agents as part  of $10,000/3 month misrepresented contracts that commissioned sales reps con real estate agents into agreeing to pay for.

To  do this to gullible real estate agents, Zillow has cultivated hundreds of sales  reps culturally taught to use puffer words like ""hot"" ""vetted"" ""Buyer"" and ""lead""  to disguise Zillow's random contacts and dupe real estate agents into buying them. In exchange for agreeing to pay $10,000+ the real estate  agent is made to believe that they will be getting about 30  of these ""hot,  vetted, qualified Buyer leads"" over the course of the 3 month/$10,000+ contract. 

However, as the years have gone by and Zillow's true colors  have shown to everyone, Zillow isn't getting as many qualified leads  from the throngs of random people it pays a fortune to drive to it's websites but it keeps  selling these five figure contracts to thousands of real estate agents every month. To bridge the every widening, doomsday gap that other ""lead gen"" type websites have encountered over the years and fulfill these new contracts to gullible real estate agents Zillow's quota bots secretly rely on Zillow's backlog of old, outdated, expired, random contacts. The agents believe they are getting a ""hot, vetted, Buyer  lead"" but instead the contact is just a random old email address, phone number or drunk that Zillow's quota bots recycle from one gullible new real estate agent's $10,000 contract to another.

Other examples of ""hot, vetted, Buyer leads"" Zillow sells to gullible real  estate agents include: People looking for a rental service not a real estate Buying agent, people who don't speak the same language as the real estate agent, people who already have a real estate agents but that agent  doesn't want to show them that specific Zillow property, drunks who email Zillow things like ""I have no idea what this, people from out of state who just  want an agent to host on demand tours of luxury properties, people who just want agents to email them video tour content they can secretly use on youtube and worse yet Zillow's quota bots still have no problem passing them along as ""hot, vetted, Buyer leads"" to gullible real estate agents at $300-$500 a pop as part of secretly fulfilling Zillows ""commitment"" to each of those thousands upon thousands of $10,000 contracts. It's highly likely that thousands of new real estate agents got duped into these contracts and paid for them having no idea what Zillow was really doing. 

Zillow might not have been like this at first but this is what it is doing now and it is F'd up and ALL shareholders should be aware of FTC/SEC  complaints rolling in. It seems some shareholders on the inside have  already caught wind what is coming as Zillow's stock continues to slide  since February. I'm Just putting the word out in case you're a  shareholder and you don't know about this yet. Gonna be one hell of a  shitshow when the FTC/SEC goes public with this. Maybe a lawsuit from tens of thousands of duped real estate agents is next when class action attorneys start spreading the word of what billiion dollar, publicly traded Zillow did to them?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  -Zillow is a 10 year long turd. Thousands of real estate agents have  gotten conned into paying five figure contracts that are intentionally  misrepresented by Zillow's commissioned sales reps.

UAE, a member of OPEC+, has been asking to increase their percentage share of OPEC's production. This is essential for them to be able to pay for and benefit from their shiny new facilities. Saudi Arabia and Russia firmly opposed this and the talks fell apart recently.

Iran has essentially ""won"" in all of the region's arenas: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.

Here's one from Aug. 22, 2017: ""The FANG stocks and others like TSLA have been over-hyped and overbought for a long time. The unwinding of the Fed's balance sheet announced for this Fall along with rising interest rates are the harbingers of the contraction of the money supply by the central bank. As the money supply contracts, asset prices will contract with it. Since one of the biggest assets is the 20 trillion dollars in the stock market, it is inevitable that we will see a big contraction in stock prices. As this becomes apparent, prices will snowball in a downward direction, perhaps similar to 2008.. GLTA""

28,investing,valuescott,The relationship between intrinsic value factors and market price," The following is a slightly edited excerpt from the book Security Analysis. The passage was written in 1934 and it is amazing how valid it is today.

In security analysis, there are two general attitudes that go into determining the market price of securities. They are investment attitudes and speculative attitudes.

Speculative attitudes include the following:

Market factors:

* Technical factors
* Manipulative factors
* Psychological factors

Speculative and investment attitudes may share the following attitudes:

Future value factors:

* Management
* Competitive conditions
* Possible and probably changes in volume, price, and costs

Investment attitudes are distinct from speculative attitudes in that they asses objective intrinsic value factors:

Intrinsic value factors:

* Earnings
* Dividends
* Assets
* Capital and Debt Structure
* Terms of the issue
* Other metrics that are considered fact.

All of these factors together form the attitude of the public towards the issue - causing them to present bids and asks at the price they deem appropriate to exchanges that in turn forms the current market price. Of course there have been many new developments since this was written, but big banks scalping for a few cents per share on each trade doesn't change the facts above.

It seems like good practice to think about all of these before making a purchase or sale to form a final opinion on if the transaction is an investment or a speculation, and even to think about what the person on the opposite side of the transaction is thinking.

Also goes to show that if efficient market theory really does exist, then the value of equities may be extremely disjoint with what its financial intrinsic value is.

The purpose of this post is not to enrage or start an argument like how some people tend to interpret posts, but rather to create some discussion points and hopefully add to all of our knowledge base or at least make you take a second and think about it.",1625688391,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ofqxsu/the_relationship_between_intrinsic_value_factors/

I did some reading and it seems like it's really taking hold and sticking around after the pandemic. So, how do I make money off it, right? Well, WELL is already becoming an empire in their industry. They're the largest clinic provider in Canada and they're a top 2 telehealth provider.

Along with their expansion in Canada, they've been buying up companies to break into the US, and they're getting ready for a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 with Fenwick &amp; West.

As for financials, they're maintaining $500M in Revenue and $100M in EBITDA, and they've got half a billion in credit lines which they've put towards their aggressive acquisitions and expansions. What blows my mind as well is that their recent cap raises all happened above the current stock price (at $9.80) so they're well positioned to buy back in at a profit if they want to, although I don't really see that happening.

43,investing,hefnertes,Diversify or keep buying the same stock? [LONG POST]," 

Basic info:

I  started trading 2 years ago and through the years i basically bought  and sold all kinds of stocks from Usa, EU, China and from all sectors  really (usually holding for 1-3months or a few weeks) this is mainly  because im constantly researching, reading, learning and experiencing  new stuff.

I have a chill job so i  research stocks a lot i think i looked up 70-80% of the USA stocks  excluding pennystocks and bank/oil companies

THE QUESTION:

So  im balls deep in corsair which i dont regret buying i kinda felt it a  safe investment and i still feel like it is very undervalued and it  could easily hit 10-20B market cap (which is a 500%growth) but i was  getting into reading all kinds of reports, checking financial data and i  feel like this stock is kinda ""stuck"" since eagletree owns like  60-70%of the shares and as soon as the stock goes up they just sell  their positions which is something i dont really care about but im not  sure how long this could last. It now goes on for half a year and they  still have shit tons of shares in their hands so it could take 2-3 years  of corsair not leaving the 30$ price range or even if it does it will  bounce back due to the heavy sell off.

So  my plan is either to diversify and keep around 20-30%of corsair and if  it leaves the 40 or 50$ range then i open a bigger 60-70% position OR i  keep buying corsair every month until it is undervalued in the 30$  range.

I have troubles selecting  stocks since the ones i like have risks not related to the performance.  Alibaba Tencet, Facebook are one of my favorite companies but they have  really high political risk. Im always thinking about getting some crypto  as well but i just dont understand it and for me it feels like a scam  since there are so many of them and every one of them is saying they are  better than the others.

There are  a lot of other companies like nvidia, apple, microsoft, tesla etc. but i  just feel like they are too overvalued im actually afraid to investing  in them. Corsair has a nice value just like Tencent or Alibaba they are  pretty well priced probably because the political situation tho

So what do you think  i should do?",1625683872,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ofpeqi/diversify_or_keep_buying_the_same_stock_long_post/
51,investing,HD140283,"PSA: If you have no understanding of the markets, and no willingness to lose money, gamble, and manage your own risk and research, please put your money in an Index Fund.","Sincerely, the guy who buys exclusively pennies and makes out with serious gains, serious losses, and serious time spent browsing ihub , random subs, Twitter posts, and news articles to scrape together a Picasso idea of what a stock could potentially do if it's even a real company and has been burned so now he pulls up said companies in Google Earth, translates addresses, types them into USPS to check legitimacy,  calls their phone, emails, etc. 


You'd be surprised how many companies out there are legitimate, just badly managed, and unfortunately you can't see those actions from tickers, numbers, etc. It's more a cumulative identification that comes with time spent trading as a stock on the market and having good quarters, news, etc. 

Case in point I bought DPLS when it was 2 cents and some bought in at .0001 or lower I imagine, but at the end of the day it only takes $100 in a single 0.0001 to go from having $100 in the market to having $10,000 if it hits a penny.  

If you are a gambler you can make way more money in the pinks just throwing money at the wall and holding. As a statistic, if there are 1000 stocks at 0.0001 and you invest a dollar in each, you will have spent $1000. If a single stock hits 10 cents, you have recouped your entire investment in the market and make out with $1000+ whatever your final losses or gains are. 

To suggest that all pinks fail is ridiculous, it's just a function of time in the market. 

If you like to gamble, just invest equally among a bunch of low price stocks and use leverage to cover your losses. It just common sense and loosely follows some of the principals available to index or hedge funds. 

If you were a disease and knew you could multiply to a very large multiple, you wouldn't care how you got to the next person. You'd just know you need to spread it around and *hope* to get someone because the benefits massively outweigh risks. Losing 1k isn't nearly as painful as telling yourself if you have bought into x penny stock, even $10, you'd feel rich as fuck, but because you had too much pride to give it even $10, you get nothing, in fact, maybe a net loss. 

Womp womp markets aren't for normal people and markets don't follow logic until the companies is in enough light to give a sense of objective direction to shareholders and market at large. 

To the guy who lost money in penny stocks and posted a PSA this morning, I feel you, but as a poor chap you gotta math it out and know there's a way to make pink markets work for you, it's just not investment in the typical, ""big boi"" market sense. 

If you want security just throw it in an index fund. You'll do good and your time investment will be minimal. 

But given most of us probably have played lotto or scratch tickets, or bought liquor, or cannabis, or other vices, if people channeled some of that money into basic investment or broad investment they'd have a sizeable chunk of money from their money doing work instead of themselves. 




Just my opinion, but if you struggled to read this opinion article from an emotional standpoint, understand that your emotions really are a part of your trading too.

If you want to check yourself before you wreck yourself, type out or write down what you want to do, think of someone you care about, and then tell yourself that *they* are making this decision for they future instead of yourself.  Ask them to write down 5 reasons why they feel the need to do it. Running out of reasons? Finding emotional reasons? 

Just stop trading for the day, go have a burger, and go people watch and enjoy life.

The reason I think this is the case is because in terms of international laws, futures are much simpler than equities (one is a pretty simple cash settled contract on another, whereas the other actually represents a real ownership stake in a company), and as a result futures are easier to trade for international market participants, who are trading while the US is asleep.

However, if given the choice, which of the two stocks would you buy and why?

Some pros and cons for both that I can think of:

**WBA Pros**:

\- Sitting on a lot of cash after selling Alliance business for $6.3 billion

\- Had a good earnings report where they beat estimates and showed good growth

\- Hired Rosalind Brewer as their new CEO, who was instrumental in Starbucks' digital transformation as their COO

\- They are looking to open up urgent care style clinics in their stores which will drive more traffic

\- It offers a nice dividend of \~3.9%

**WBA Cons**:

\- Their most recent earning numbers were good largely in part due to the Covid vaccine rush, which they predicted would be a lot less next quarter and later in the year

\- Wallstreet analysts are still not very bullish on the stock with a Hold rating on it and a 1 yr price target of $54

**CVS Pros**:

\- also offers a nice dividend yield of 2.4%

\- has more favorable analyst ratings and a 1 yr price target of $95

\- has shown good growth and earnings

\- their merger with Aetna will help drive more customers to the stores for their in-store clinics

**CVS Cons:**

\- could see a similar drop in traffic due to covid vaccine demands going down after summer

\- There are talks of Amazon moving into the pharmacy business but not sure how much of a threat that would pose and how realistic that is

Many lower quality companies intentionally divide their company into shares with a low price to attract young investors that don't do good due diligence. Also, many of these companies don't trade on popular exchanges that subject them to harsher terms. To further prove this point let's looks at Captain's Pizzeria. 

Captain's Pizzeria is worth $1,000

If I divide Captain's Pizzeria into 1000 shares each share is worth $1.

$1000 valuation / 1000 shares = $1 a share

If I divide Captain's Pizzeria into 100 shares each share is worth $10

$1000 valuation / 100 shares = $5 a share

89,investing,Ok_Resolution_3670,"[DD] $VMAR, Tesla of the Sea","Okay first, let me get through the buzz words... *ahem*... 

“NEW EV SECTOR??!? TESLA WAS AN EV!!! EV + BOAT = 🚀🚀🌊🚀? “

Now that that’s out of the way, let me tell you what Vision Marine does and why I really like this stock.

	 
	- Company
	
Vision Marine is a Canadian boating company that specializes in electric motors. Until now they’ve just made their own boats and sold packages to  OEMs. Recently, however, they announced their first consumer outboard motor, the 180E. This is a 180 horsepower (think 24 foot center console boat) fully electric motor that they rate for 70 miles at 20 mph. It is emission free, quiet, and requires 90% less maintenance! (This is huge). Downsides are cost and limited charging options.


	- Health of Company

One thing VMAR has going for it that Tesla did not, is that it is already* a profitable company. (Was profitable until it began RnD on the 180E). They have amassed enough liquidity to continue their current spending rates for 3 years before going into debt. As many of you know, Tesla was in debt from the start. 


	-The Bad

The bad things about the product are that the entire package is $80k. This is VERY expensive. The motor itself is $26k and the rest goes towards battery, operating system, monitor, and charging kit. For reference, a Yamaha 175hp outboard engine costs only $18k. Another downside is charging solutions, this motor is not made of off-shore voyages, but more for inland fishing and days on the water. However, I don’t think these are dire problems. I will discuss the charging in a moment, but as for the cost, you have to remember this is their first product. The next generations should be more accessible.


	- The Good

These things are efficient. I mean REALLY efficient. The package ships with a 90 kWh battery. Those familiar with EVs are thinking “70 miles? Tesla’s are pushing 300 miles with a battery like that!” And... you’re right. But the thing about boats is that they are inherently inefficient. Not only do they have to move air out of the way, but water too. It is impossible to find exact stats due to the variety of boats this could go on, but the average center console with a 175 hp engine will see 3 mpg ON A GOOD DAY. Suddenly only 25% efficiency of its land counterpart looks pretty good.

I said charging would be a pain right? Well it is a pain, more more of a hangnail and less of a broken finger. These engines require 220v to charge which needs to be installed at your home, just as with a Tesla or other EV. The good news is that many docks and most marinas already come equipped.

Also note: they just received a $1.7m grant from the Canadian government… as if their financials weren’t good already good enough. 

Oh and did I mention that according to Forbes, Drake and Robert De Niro rock their tech? (Can’t find their sauce but it’s cool I guess?)


TL;DR:  VMAR makes water Tesla’s, have a healthy company history, and are on the right track. If they can produce a product the public likes within 3 years, the possibilities are endless.

91,investing,Far_wide,The utility (or otherwise) of CAPE,"As someone who likes to stick with index funds and most of the passive investing mantras, I'm always intrigued by CAPE.

I'm led to believe there's a moderate correlation between CAPE and forward stock returns. With the US stock market having an astronomical CAPE of 37 at present, the median expectation of those forward returns are -0.9% p.a. on a 10-year basis.

Meanwhile, the same valuation mechanism is highly encouraging for the long underperforming emerging markets and Europe areas.

It superficially seems quite a useful metric, and yet also, it's actually balls isn't it?  Who here wants to plump all of their money in EM/Europe and out of the USA? If we had listened to CAPE 8 years ago, we'd have done abysmally, as those areas that haven't done well have largely continued not to.

So I find myself believing that my forward returns are likely to be poor, whilst also not being anywhere near confident enough in the metric to either disinvest or substantially rebalance to low CAPE regions.

I guess I'm asking, is anyone else wrestling with whether to pay attention to CAPE at all? Does it have any actionable value to you for your portfolio that I might not be appreciating?",1625664507,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ofiw26/the_utility_or_otherwise_of_cape/

**Management**

	There has been a rumor going around that the Chinese government has taken away Jack Ma's power. In an interview with Joe Tsai (Alibaba Co-founder), Mr. Tsai explains that Jack Ma stepped down as CEO from Alibaba two years ago and also handed over the chairmanship to current CEO Daniel Zhang. Joe Tsai continues to explain that, ""the idea that Jack has this enormous amount of power is not quite right."" When Jack Ma stepped down, he relinquished his responsibility for handling the company. Jack Ma has stepped away from his success to pursue other opportunities such as creating a business school and hobbies like painting. ""He is living a normal life after business"" - Joe Tsai. Watch the full interview \[here\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KveMLJNhwkc)

	Before becoming the current CEO of Alibaba, Daniel Zhang was CEO of Taobao and president of Tmall which is now owned by Alibaba. Zhang is credited with creating the Chinese shopping holiday ""Singles' Day"" which grosses three times as many sales as Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.

	I believe that a descending wedge is forming. If true, then this would indicate that an uptrend is going to occur. However, we won't be able to confirm this pattern until months later. My estimations indicate that the breakout will occur somewhere between the $198-208 range. I want to make it clear that this is based on MY analysis. I am by no means a professional.

**BABA Vs. AMZN**

	Alibaba acts as a marketplace that connects sellers to buyers. In other words, Alibaba does not own any of the products/merchandise. Amazon is a re-seller that owns the inventory and supply chain of its merchandise and sells directly to customers. One feature that I like about Alibaba is that most sellers offer discounts on bulk orders which is something that Amazon does not currently offer. Alibaba dominates the Asian market while Amazon dominates the U.S market. Alibaba owns an 8.4% market share of all global retail e-commerce in 2020. Amazon owns a 13.7% market share of all global retail e-commerce in 2020. I know there has been some heated discussion involving Amazon's private label brands. AMZN has been accused of creating products and removing competitor products to make more money. In retrospect to Amazon, Alibaba is a much cheaper buy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

	IMO, Alibaba is a strong buy. The financial statement and balance sheet numbers are some of the best I've seen compared to other companies I've done due diligence on. I like the fact that Alibaba doesn't own the products themselves. Instead, they connect the sellers to the buyers.  Alibaba makes money off of commissions and advertising storefronts instead of buying and selling the products themselves. Alibaba owns a wide range of subsidiaries making it a more stable company. If one market goes down, they stand to lose less by diversifying their assets.

97,investing,dailyidea,Startups to check out and invest in?,"Hello people of Reddit!

Ever since I started looking at startups and thinking about investing, I find myself bombarded with information and statistics on every site with their ‘’TOP 5’’ or ‘’BEST OF’’ startups, so I figured – this is a perfect place to ask for opinions. How do you guys manage trusting your decisions about investments? Do you have a certain system in place for this or do you just trust your gut depending on the company you are interested in? I have made a list for myself with several startups that I think are worth investing and I would like to hear your opinion on them.

**Quell** ([https://playquell.com/](https://playquell.com/)) – a new form of gaming, involving a full body activity. It uses a chest and hand strap that connects to your PC wirelessly. Seems like a good team, currently focused on providing user testing soon. From the looks of it, this could be integrated in the current VR eco-systems to provide that ‘’feel of movement’’ other VR are currently lacking. Finally, a workout we can all relate to.

**Fathom** ([https://www.fathomhq.com/](https://www.fathomhq.com/)) – Financial intelligence, performance reporting, dashboards…I’ve always hated Excel for not being easy on the eyes and was never a huge fan of Google Analytics (not saying it’s bad), because it always felt like a chore to watch al the tables and lines in boring colors. What I see here is the opportunity to personalize your own setup that combines the beauty of the ‘’presentation version’’ and the detailedness of the entire set of data. It’s like having Excel, Word, Powerpoint and Google Analytics all in one place. 

**AirGarage** (https://airgara.ge/) – now this is the one I think everybody should have. A full-service parking operator. If you have an extra space you can rent it to someone and AG takes care of everything, and by everything I mean setup, payment processing, maintenance…etc. They even put security cameras so no car would park there illegally. Every person with a house and a parking lot should have this. Just think about it…when you are at work, what does your parking space at home do? Nothing! But with this, you can charge people to use it while you don’t need it. 

**Capella Space** ([https://www.capellaspace.com/](https://www.capellaspace.com/)) – since most of us are not Bruce Wayne and cannot afford our own satellite, this is the next best thing. This company made it possible for other people to ‘’book satellite time’’ and take pictures of your desired location on Earth or certain constellations. The technology it uses is called Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and you can use all that on a web portal. Seems they provide you with the console and the API.

**XFARM** ([https://xfarm.ag/?lang=en](https://xfarm.ag/?lang=en)) – I think this is the best thing that can happen to a farm. With the IoT growing each day, we find ourselves in need to simplify and seamlessly connect different things. XFARM allows farmers to monitor and analyze their crops with great precision, over a simple mobile app.

Since I am no expert, just a guy following his gut, I would like to hear your thoughts on these companies. Have you heard of them? Would you invest in them? Why not? If there are any more startups you think are worth checking out, feel free to leave a link in the comments or DM me.

In my opinion, it makes more sense to go for the blue chip stocks… you know they are strong, not gonna go anywhere and their fundamental history can reassure you. Whereas “undervalued” companies, I feel like there is a much bigger risk there. Most of the time they are relatively newer companies with next to no fundamental history to back anything up. 

Just my opinion of course. If you prefer to buy “undervalued” stocks over blue chill stocks, please give some reasoning. I’m not against them, just can’t quite understand the risk vs reward.",1625661536,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ofi2ul/blue_chip_stocks_vs_undervalued_stocks/

8,investing,TouksMode,Kaleyra price target increase to $26 by order.market,"Source: www.order.market

107% upside potential 

Kaleyra, Inc. is a global group providing mobile communication services for financial institutions and enterprises of all sizes worldwide. Through its proprietary platform, Kaleyra manages multi-channel integrated communication services on a global scale, comprising messages, push notifications, e-mail, instant messaging, voice services and chatbots. Kaleyra’s technology makes it possible to safely and securely manage billions of messages monthly with a reach to hundreds of MNOs and over 190 countries. After renaming itself Kaleyra in February 2018, the company acquired India-based bulk-messaging provider Solutions Infini in June 2018 and Virginia-based Buc Mobile, a transactional and promotional messaging service in July 2018.

Kaleyra traded lower on the weaker-than-expected revenue outlook, but we expect the impact will be largely isolated to FY21 with little spillover to FY22. We expect recovery from COVID-related lock-downs in Europe, India and Brazil will lag the US by one, two and three-to-four quarters, respectively. We also note Brazil, the likely laggard of the group, is for Kaleyra the smallest of the four regions and represents ~10% of pro forma revenue. The bottom line is that while COVID-related revenue pressure will linger in FY21, the impact will significantly subside in FY22, and underlying business fundamentals remain extremely favorable, in our opinion. As such we think y/y revenue growth in FY22 could be well-ahead of the 20-30% rates seen pre-COVID.

mGage Acquisition. Kaleyra is now among the top-5 global CPaaS platforms with strong positions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions. Perhaps best of all, the company's existing North American customer base now contributes ~30% of consolidated revenue. We expect significant cross-selling, given that a) despite the large combined size, the two companies have virtually zero overlap among a combined 3,800 enterprise customers; and b) the companies have to this point focused primarily on distinct phases of the customer transaction, with mGage specializing on marketing and customer acquisition while Kaleyra has focused on execution and customer support.

COVID Impact. Though the pace of vaccinations and economic reopenings continues to impact near-term results, conditions are generally improving, with the US leading and India continuing to lag. Structurally, however, the industry is likely to remain in a high-growth phase for several years, with global revenues from CPaaS services like secure messaging and voice expected to see CAGRs of 25-35% through at least 2025.



Potential Further M&amp;A. Kaleyra acquired mGage for $215 million including $195 million of cash plus 1.6 million shares valued at $12.50 per share. In a related transaction, Kaleyra issued 8.4 million shares at $12.50 per share and raised $200 million in unsecured notes convertible into common shares at $16.88 per share. The financing added ~$90 million of cash to Kaleyra's balance sheet, i.e., leaves Kaleyra with ~$130 million of cash. The combined company generates positive free cashflow (seasonally-weak 1Q aside). While under no pressure to execute additional transactions (underlying organic growth should remain strong for at least several years), management will continue to evaluate any opportunities that might arise.

Our target price of $26 per share (4.2x FY22E revenue) for cloud-based mobile messaging and telephony service provider Kaleyra represents &gt;100% upside versus today's valuation that in our opinion places too great a discount on the growth opportunity in enterprise SMS messaging and, in particular, Kaleyra’s secure mobile banking prowess. ~30% revenue growth and margin expansion, driven by U.S. market share wins, as well as the unwinding of preexisting SPAC commitments, should translate into multiple expansion, in our opinion.

Zoltan Pozsar Sees a $1 Trillion Problem for Money Markets Ahead

The Credit Suisse strategist estimates up to $1.3 trillion of Treasury bills could be rotated into the Federal Reserve’s reverse repo facility by the end of August.

By 

Tracy Alloway

July 4, 2021, 8:59 PM EDT

An explosive mix of  excess cash sloshing in the financial system, ongoing quantitative easing and a looming debt ceiling deadline could combine to create a headache for major money markets, according to Zoltan Pozsar.

The Credit Suisse Group AG strategist and long-time Odd Lots guest has earned a reputation for predicting the repo madness of late 2019, and is once again predicting volatility in a key funding market. At issue is the amount of money that could flow into the Federal Reserve’s reverse repurchase facility (RRP) as money market funds and banks reshuffle their existing holdings to take advantage of a recent increase in interest.

The Fed surprised the market last month by tweaking interest paid on the RRP from nothing to 5 basis points, a move that’s been luring billions of dollars into a facility intended to help the central bank keep a floor under interest rates. Already Pozsar estimates that usage of the facility has jumped by $300 billion since the RRP rate hike as money market funds dump lower-yielding T-bills in favor of parking cash at the RRP.

Now he sees the possibility of more money flowing in:

“The first chart on page six shows the results for the largest fund complexes – as of May 31st, the largest money funds had capacity to rotate out of $1 trillion of bills and place that much more money in the o/n RRP facility – that’s a lot.

In other words, Pozsar argues that money market funds are incentivized to rotate out of Treasury bills and into the newly-lucrative RRP, potentially leaving billions of dollars worth of bills that the market will need to absorb, thereby draining reserves from the banking system.

So far that hasn’t been too much of a problem, with shorter-term investors keen to snap up bills ahead of an expected crunch in supply. A reinstatement of the debt ceiling, which was suspended during the depths of the pandemic, is expected to hit supply as the Treasury will have to slash its balance at the Fed to $400 billion before July 31.

But ongoing QE from the Fed ($250 billion in the next two months) will leave some $400 billion that still needs to be drained, according to Pozsar’s estimates. That could lead to market weirdness as banks retool their balance sheets:

$400 billion sterilized is a lot, but nothing relative to the $2.25 trillion in reserves added during the pandemic – we shouldn’t really hyperventilate about all this in the aggregate. But we don’t like to look at things in the aggregate.

If institutions spend $400 billion of non-operating deposits on Treasury bills, which banks will lose those deposits? Probably those that grew the most during the pandemic, which were J.P. Morgan and Bank of America, where the sum of brokered and non-operating deposits grew by $200 and $125 billion, respectively (see charts on page 3 and 4). Maybe these pandemic deposits are just as sticky as pre-pandemic deposits, but maybe not. We’ll just have to see. But if these deposits go, the J.P. Morgan portfolio will lend fewer reserves in the FX swap market, and Bank of America will have less excess reserves to fund its recent, “programmatic” purchases of duration. The liquidity posture of the lender of next-to-last-resort and the buyer-of-last resort will thus change. None of this is an issue for the banks in discussion, but it could lead to events in the markets – FX swaps, long-dated Treasuries, and MBS – that they backstop… Bank of America enters this period with its reserves at the lower end of their post pandemic range.”

Pozsar’s promised more info on the market effects on Tuesday.

42,investing,Dynasty__93,"Opinions on using borrowed money to invest in ""safe"" ETFs and index funds?","Debt is bad, religions even teach it is bad. Using debt to invest when those investments could go ""blip"" sounds crazy, and I retyped this about twenty times, deleted a few times, and here I am again posting it. 

The reason I am writing this is because of conversations (2 in particular) I have overheard or been part of over my life talking to people who went from the middle class to becoming part of the wealthy. One was when I was a kid at the Grand Ole Opry in Tennessee. A company my dad worked for at the time sent our family down there for a week vacation. My dad who at the time was considering getting in to real estate began to explore the idea of going into investing/real estate and began talking to a multi-millionaire who has since passed away. The millionaire's chat with my dad can be summarized with him saying ""At one point, in my early 30s, I realized I had the same amount of money as most who were my age. So I took all of my savings and I invested all of it in one options trade, also using as much borrowed money as I could. That one options trade made me more money, and saved me time from having to continue working. That is how you become a millionaire before 40."" 

This seemed ridiculously dangerous, and it was only a few years before the sub-prime mortgage crisis (debt caused). Then, I saw a post similar to this man's story on a subreddit about a guy who had $10k at the age of 22. He realized most people who are 22 not only have $0, but they are in debt. So he took all of his $10k, and borrowed another $15k and bought a bunch of large cap stocks that he felt would go up 200% in 2 years. They did, and he I believe after paying his debt back was worth $100k by the age of 25. I remember him writing ""once you are at 100k, the hardest part is over because then you can throw that money into one index fund and let compound interest soar for a number of years."" 

I have read over 20 books in my life regarding debt, wealth, investing, etc. I want to believe these two stories are simply luck, but I am not beginning to believe this. Most brokerage firms charge low interest to borrow money, and I do believe if you know what you are doing you can easily make a profit. But I am only 28 yo, and I have lived through more massive market recessions than previous generations - so I am actually not so sure if using debt to build wealth is a good idea. 

Before anyone tells me to read Dave Ramsey - I have read two of his books and mostly agree with him. However, there was one time on his show he took a phone call from someone who used a lot of debt to become very wealthy, and Ramsey said to this caller ""I want to learn from you."" Ramsey listened to how the man used debt to build wealth, and it was an eye opener I think for us listeners who are used to him screaming debt is bad listening to a man basically say debt is the reason he was able to become wealthy. 

Last - I want anyone's opinion on this who would be willing to share their opinions. If you do reply to this post, tell me how much debt I should at most tolerate knowing my current situation: 28 yo, single, no kids. Low cost of living (live with a relative for cheap). Full time job, gross income is $50k. Current assets in bank/brokerage/crypto = $17k. Debt (student loans) = $11k. Car is paid for. I have had friends who invest on both extreme spectrums. One friend told me to pay off my student loans and keep investing slowly for the next several years. Another friend told me to use as much money my brokerage is willing to borrow for stocks I like long term (semiconductors).",1625622790,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/of9887/opinions_on_using_borrowed_money_to_invest_in/

Theoretically,  it shouldn't be that hard. The market return is an average of stocks going up and down.  Some go up, some go down. For instance, if I mirrored a portfolio of the SPY holdings, I will have 500 stocks in various amounts. Some of these will do better than others. For active portfolio managers whose full time job it is to manage funds, all they would have to do is identify one stock that may not match the SPY and wither sell or buy more of that. And yet it is notoriously impossible for any fund to ever beat the market consistently.

52,investing,SignificantConflict3,Investing Strategies and College Question,"Hello everyone, I had a question about adjusting my current investment strategies as I am beginning my first year as an independent, in my own apartment, at a new school. 

Currently, about 60% of my income goes to my Roth IRA, into an index fund for retirement, which I plan to continue no matter what, I'll just have to find a job ASAP after transferring. (I'm 19 btw, so that's why it seems like such a large %.)

In addition, I throw about 15% into a long term growth account in real estate, and then I'll throw about 10% into a brokerage, where I actively trade options in a non-degenerate fashion to keep myself intellectually stimulated and entertained. The rest (15%) is cash. 

My question is, would it be a smart idea to temporarily shift the focus of my accounts from long term growth to short term dividend payments to help provide a bit of an income stream through college where I won't be able to work as much? 

My thought was that I'd shift my real estate account from ""long term growth"" to ""supplemental income,"" then, I would liquidate my brokerage account, as well as some cash, and purchase safer dividend etfs to supplement my income as well. 

  
TLDR:

I want to temporarily adjust my investments to supplement my income through college, as opposed to having a long term growth focus, although I would continue to invest roughly 50% into my Roth IRA as an index fund. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on the matter?

59,investing,CrimsonRaider2357,Change my view: The market's reaction to $SHEN this week is completely irrational.,"Now, I'll start by conceding that I don't know very much about this company specifically, and there could be things I'm missing here. I'm hoping to gain some insight into the rationale of people buying this stock in response to its recent news.

The context, for those unaware: Before last week, $SHEN had spent the last year trading mostly sideways around $50/share. Last Friday, $SHEN announced it will pay a special dividend of $18.75 per share to its shareholders, a total payment of around $1 billion. This money came from the company selling assets to T-Mobile of about $2 billion. $SHEN proceeded to shoot up to a close today (Tuesday) of over $61/share. People are going crazy over this dividend.

This makes no sense to me, for several reasons. First, dividends are not free money, they come out of the company's purse, and thus decrease the current value of the company. The $18.75/share that the company is ""giving away"" was already priced in to the price of the company. If the company was worth $50/share before last week, and it pays out $18.75/share, the fair value of the company after the dividend should be $31.25/share, all else being equal. From a fundamental market efficiency perspective, this doesn't make any sense, unless the entire market had forgotten to price in this sale (which I'm assuming wasn't a massive surprise, but even if it was, the assets that were sold to T-Mobile should've been priced in anyway before their sale, so there shouldn't have been much price movement.)

Instead, people seem to be jumping on the company just to get that sweet, sweet dividend. Why? It is irrational to buy a share just to get a dividend, so the price of the share can drop by the value of the dividend. This would result in a break-even. Except it's worse than that, because dividends are tax-inefficient compared to the capital gain of holding the higher valued share (especially if you're not planning on holding the share for 60 days, which I think many of these people aren't).  On top of that, the $1 billion the company is giving out to its shareholders is $1 billion that could've been used to invest in the company and grow its future profits. If anything, the company has lost value by giving away so much money instead of getting a return on it.

I'm not trying to insult or attack anyone who has bought this company, I'm open to having my mind changed and I hope I can gain some insight into why the market is reacting the way it has.",1625614974,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/of712g/change_my_view_the_markets_reaction_to_shen_this/

65,investing,killerwhaleinvesting,What is Junior Mining and how to decide which stocks to buy?,"Junior Mining companies are low market cap and thinly traded exploration companies that are primarily involved in the exploration of gold, silver, or other elements &amp; minerals. Juniors seek potential opportunities by acquiring properties that can yield large resource deposits. These companies usually start off as private companies and then go public to raise capital for their different stages of exploration to reach the ultimate goal of mining.

Junior Mining Companies go through various stages throughout their lifecycle of discovering minerals. Check out our blog explaining every stage in detail: [The Company stagesLifecycle of Junior Mining Companies](https://www.zimtu.com/junior-mining-company-stages/).

How to decide which Junior Mining Stock to buy

* Analyze drilling results
* Check locations of the properties
* Watch for the market cap of the companies
* Estimate the political risk involved with the project
* Look at the long-term plans and future demand of the mineral
* Research about the geologists’ backgrounds and their expertise
* Look for the companies with strong balance sheets, low debt and positive cash flows

75,investing,Temperature_Full,Why Bitfarms Stock Should be on Your Watch List,"Bitfarms (NASDAQ: BITF) is currently one of the best-performing cryptocurrency stocks. Bitfarms stock is up by more than 100 percent year-date, and its business model of mining Bitcoin indicates that the company is on its maturity cusp. Below are reasons why Bitfarms stock should be on your watch list.

## China Ban

China’s ban on cryptocurrency mining companies means that Bitfarms is facing less competition. Chinese miners accounted for about 70 percent of the global supply of cryptocurrency this year. Now that dominance has been surrendered.

Less completion translates to less difficulty in mining each Bitcoin. Experts estimate that the difficulty in mining bitcoin has declined by 40 percent. A further drop will improve Bitfarms productivity margin even when the Bitcoin market value declines.

## Solid Bitcoin Operations

Bitfarms had a solid performance in the first quarter, and its stock has been surging. Its first-quarter revenue came at $28.4 million, and its gross profit equated to $19.3 million. Bitarms mined 598 Bitcoins in the first quarter, at an average price of $8, 400, the company made 548 million. Since the end of the first quarter, Bitfarms has continued to accumulate Bitcoins inventory to about 1,000.

## NASDAQ Listing

Bitfarms has three private placements for gross proceeds of about CA$80 million. That net profit keeps the company’s finances in a position to expedite infrastructure expansion and make deposits for miners. The company has been listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This is an important milestone that gives Bitfarms exposure to the capital market.

Bitfarms stock is trading at a price to sales multiple of 14, and the price to book the multiple of five. The stock is still worth buying given that a Bitcoin comeback of Bitcoin will allow the company to generate more revenues that will bolster shareholder value.

## Bottom line

Bitfarms is outperforming Bitcoin, and its mining operation benefits from China’s ban on cryptocurrency. It faces less competition, and it is in a better mining margin. In addition, the company has access to the capital market on Nasdaq, and thus its stock will continue to outperform.",1625603698,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/of3ijf/why_bitfarms_stock_should_be_on_your_watch_list/
77,investing,green9206,Elliot Wave - Can this really predict the long term future of the stock markets?,"I am not really into technical analysis, however I have heard about this supposed Elliot wave which can use chart patterns to predict long term outcomes. I stumbled across this guy named Mark Galasiewski, I saw a video of his from June 2020 and I can't believe all the stuff coming true looking at it now. He says that if you stop looking at the stock market in a rational way, everything will make sense. You have to look at it non rationally. Like for example he said markets did not crash due to Covid pandemic but instead pandemics happens at the end of the bear market(although usa was not in bear market at the time), same with oil prices and other stuff. He also said that the market did not recover due to the Fed's interference but inspite of it.In the long term, it does not matter what individual countries and their governments do, the stock markets will keep going as per the chart patterns of the Elliot Wave.

82,investing,pyrolovesmoney,I experimented with committing to a $25 dollar per week investment in TSLA for at least a year and here are my results.,"Last year I challenged myself to invest at least $25 automatically in Tesla each week using a recurring transfer. I figured it would be a good way to build up my investment in the company while taking a manageable risk and potentially getting some market gains. Since my brokerage offered partial share investments I figured it would be a fun way to see where my money was in a year.

After 1 year here are my results:

Start Date: July 6, 2020

Initial investment: $30 (.023017 shares at 1,300.38)

July 6 2021 Investment Value: $2,546.70

Total Invested with Auto-Transfer: $1,300

Total Return: $697 (+37.64%)

Extra periodic market buys: ~$550

Average Cost of entire stake: $447.40

Current price of Stock: 657.54 (about 150% gain since initial investment date)

Conclusion: Although it would have been great to be able to increase my investment on each dip, having the recurring transfer helped me take advantage of the partial share feature offered by my brokerage and keep my average cost low. During the same time period SPY has gained about 36% so my results are comparable to investing in SPY during the same time so, i potentially took on more risk than if I had just been investing in SPY the whole time. Although it would have been nice to be able put $1300 back in July 2020 and see it more than double, because I didn't have cash on hand, I only got about 1/3 of the potential gains of holding the stock the entire time. Although my returns aren't much better than SPY, I am happy with the results of my little experiment and plan to continue this process and add a few more dollars per week into other companies and ETF's that I feel strongly about.

Let me know your thoughts. I know this isn't groundbreaking stuff, but it's a small look into what you can do if you are literally storing the equivalent of 3 lunch meals a week in an investment account. Obviously one side note, the biggest downside to this way of investing is that my tax lots are all over the place and if I have to sell, I have an ongoing 1 year rolling date for ""long"" tax rates but, I don't plan on selling any time soon, so as time goes on, that will be less of an issue.",1625599749,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/of26bq/i_experimented_with_committing_to_a_25_dollar_per/

86,investing,Empty_Performance308,"DD and thesis on Sea Limited ($SE) - Bet on EM and TAM of ecommerce, gaming, and financial services model).","Hello everyone! Wanted to share my thinking on $SE... which is my largest position!

I think Sea Limited ($SE) will see growth in e-commerce, gaming and financial services businesses in its South East Asia and Latin America markets.   I think $SE’s revenues will grow from $8.9B in 2021 &gt; $48B in 2025, or about 41% each year (compound annual growth rate or CAGR).

[$SE](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SE) has a leading share in SE Asia, where e-commerce is still early (penetration or share is 10% of retail) so I think its e-commerce revenues can increase 7x to reach $30B by 2025.   SE Asia + Taiwan + LATAM population is roughly size of China. I think it could scale like [$PDD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PDD).

Based on the size of gaming markets, I think gaming business can increase 3.5x to reach $15B by 2025 and which will be ½ the current size of a leading gaming company, Tencent, [$TCTZV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TCTZV),  by comparison.  Expansion of battle royale games in Latam + India. Plus new developments.

And finally Financial Services to grow rapidly with the e-commerce business and become a $3B business by 2025, based on adoption on the e-commerce platform.  I look at AliPay in [$BABA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BABA) as a model of growth (has $7.6B in revenues).

I assume business will deliver profits as it starts to become more efficient with logistics and marketing costs, once it gets to a larger size (i.e.it “scales”).   The e-commerce model seems similar to [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN) (i.e. fixed costs), which has scaled profitably.

I think management will likely continue to invest the profits into new businesses.   They acquired asset management firm to help with capital allocation.  Founder-CEO owns 25% of shares. Insiders and Tencent another 50%+.  Think all aligned in terms of share-return focus.

I apply a forward 10x “multiple” of sales based on similar companies, one e-commerce and one gaming (Tencent and PingDuoDuo), on 2025 estimated revenue. This estimates $SE’s share price will reach $520 / share over the next five years.

Risks in the bet IMO  Gaming is mostly based on one-title and needs to be evolved. Shopee e-commerce could be challenged by other players. Execution of financial services as a new business.  

Bet on the execution and strategy of Forrest Xiaodong Li.  (Has been amazing so far.)

Summary:

Bet on lots of growth from EM with TAM size of China using business models (e-commerce, gaming, financial services) that have worked in other markets.  And also bet execution and strategy Forrest Xiaodong Li.

**MKS Instruments** (Nasdaq: **MKSI**) is a global producer of measuring and controlling devices used in advanced manufacturing and semiconductor processes. They also provide services related to their products including installation, maintenance, repair and training. Primary industries are semiconductor, healthcare, research and defense.

&gt;!Recent News!&lt;

July 2021: announced acquisition of Atotech Ltd (ATC), a process chemicals technology company

May 2021: announced acquisition of Canadian company Photon Control Inc. in an all cash transaction.

Both these recent acquisitions broaden their product and service portfolio and increase future market share. It highlights the upwards trajectory of the company, liquid balance sheet and overall healthy financial position.

&gt;!Markets!&lt;

*Semiconductors -* A significant portion of sales (around 50%) are derived from products sold to semiconductor device manufacturers. This is an explosive growth industry where both demand and revenues continue to grow. With this demand and a chip supply shortage the semiconductor industry looks poised for a great 2021 and beyond.

*Advanced Markets -* MKSI products are also used in the industrial technologies, life and health sciences, research and defense.

*International Markets -* Overseas sales accounts for around half of MKSI’s net revenues. Out-with the company’s US facilities MKSI benefits from overseas manufacturing facilities located in Austria, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Romania, Singapore, and South Korea.

&gt;!Financials!&lt;

Market Cap: **9.88B**

In 2020 MKSI reported record EBITDA of **$555.7 million** and an EPS of **$6.33**

On Apr 26, 2021, MKSI reported Q1 2021 revenue of **$693.90 million** up **29.53%** year over year. Revenue has increased annually by an average of **16%** over the past 5 years.

EPS has increased by an average of **45% per year** over the past 5 years. This company demonstrates health and consistent growth.

A healthy balance sheet and ended 2020 with a healthy debt to equity ratio of **0.35**

Strong through cycle free cash flow. 70% of capital reinvested in growth initiatives such as acquisitions, debt management, product development and dividends.

&gt;!Stock Price &amp; Valuations!&lt;

Currently trading around **$166** at the time of writing. Consensus price targets of **$226 have a more than 30% upside**. Several analysts have price targets of over **$240**

P/E of **23.04x** &amp; PEG of **0.87x**

&gt;!Why do I think this a buy?!&lt;

MKSI continues to benefit hugely from the high demand and revenues from the semiconductor market. Demonstrating revenue growth and a large and diverse product portfolio providing many revenue streams and growth opportunities. An even split of domestic and international sales puts the company in a strong position going forward without having to rely on a single market for success. Institutional investors now own **96%** of the total shares outstanding.

91,investing,Lost-Guarantee229,Understanding Chainlink...,"\*I am new to Chainlink and this is my initial research/understanding, if you can correct me, or help me to understand more about Chainlink, please do in the comments\*

***Summary:***

Chainlink (LINK-USD) is a decentralized network that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Chainlink provides off-chain data/information to the blockchain, making it on-chain data that can be used for smart contracts via their Decentralized Oracle Networks (DON’s).

Chainlink has been able to revolutionize smart contracts through the integration of off-chain data. This is because the off-chain data allows for exponentially more use cases for these smart contracts, which may help us adopt crypto faster than previously thought.

In the future, Chainlink plans to improve upon their anonymity (where they can and where it makes sense) and implementing what they call “meta contracts”.

Note: There will be a list of definitions at the end of this article to help clarify some general and technical terms used throughout this analysis.

***The History of Chainlink:***

The Chainlink protocol was created in 2017, they were able to do this through a $32M round of funding. Chainlink’s main goal is to solve the Oracle problem so that the power of the blockchain can be unlocked and adapted quicker. Chainlink aims to do this through their DON’s.

Through their network, Chainlink is able to provide Price feeds (useful for DeFi), verifiable randomness, proof of reserve, the Keeper network, and more.

Recently, they have released Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper, which broadens the capabilities of their Decentralized Oracle Networks, provides tamper-proof data delivery, and secure off-chain computation. This update was made to make Chainlink even more scalable by providing more security, privacy, and authenticity.

Lastly, this update lowers Chainlink’s gas (transaction) price of Oracle updates by 90%.

***General Information:***

Chainlink is a fixed supply coin and has a supply cap of 1B coins (currently there is only 435.51M coins in supply).

Currently, Chainlink has a price of $19.05 (USD), and is actively traded, with their volume being approximately $1B traded in the last 24 hours.

Chainlink has a market cap of $8.38B, making it the current 15th largest cryptocurrency. Furthermore, their fully diluted market cap is $19.25B.

Chainlink’s (1B) token supply is distributed as follows:

· **Company:** 300M of their tokens are reserved/allocated to their parent company (Smartcontract.com). This number fairly standard and it is good that this is not higher, because the higher this number, the more likely a rug pull, and less of a potential upside.

· **Community Holders:** 350M of their tokens are reserved for their holders, investors, and community. This number being so high is good for Chainlink because it gives them the potential to have big returns.

· **Node Operators:** The other 350M tokens are reserved for Chainlink’s node operators. This is also good to see such a large allocation of tokens to them.

***Chainlink’s Decentralized Oracle Network (DON):***

Chainlink is able to bring real world data to the Chainlink network and blockchain, through their DON’s. This is especially important when looking at the application of Chainlink’s smart contracts because DON’s were made specifically to enhance and extend the capabilities of these contracts. **By utilizing a DON, Chainlink is able to improve upon existing smart contracts because they can now be connected to the real world**.

DON’s offer networking, storage, and computation systems, while providing confidentiality, integrity, and accountability. These are offered through 2 functions of DON’s, executables, and adopters.

· *Executables:* Programs that run continuously, and in a decentralized manner to improve performance and allows for confidential computation, which will be discussed in-depth later. Executables run and perform their operations on Chainlink’s DON, working hand-in-hand with adapters to link external data.

· *Adapters:* Adapters (when working in DON’s) can send and retrieve data from off-DON systems, operate bidirectionally, and leverage joint computation to achieve more features (ie. Encryption for privacy)

**Adapters communicate information from web servers to executables, then communicate the information from the executable to the blockchain. This is how Chainlink is able to fetch their off-chain data for their DON’s (which consist of the executable and storage).**

An example of how this works is given through Chainlink’s founder (Seregey Nazarov) in a podcast with Lex Fridman, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXTmVdlyoc).

Nazarov described their DON and smart contract capabilities through an example of crop insurance. Where he went on to say they could use their smart contracts that run on Ethereum to make crop insurance contracts between a farmer in Bolivia and an insurance company in America, in which the farmer gets paid if it does not rain for let’s say 14 days straight. Chainlink’s smart contracts can collect external data from 5-7 different and trusted API’s (could be weather stations, radars, local news channels etc.) to determine how long it has not rained for, and if the period of time that it has not rained is verified and 14 days (as stated in the hypothetical contract), the contract will be executed, and the farmer will be compensated. This is a game changer and allows people (like farmers in Bolivia) to hedge their risk, which would never have been available to them otherwise. And all of this runs on DON’s, adapters, and executables on Chainlink’s system.

*This technology, combined with smart contracts, has never been seen before, and has enormous potential in terms of future use cases.*

***Hybrid Smart Contracts:***

Chainlink refers to their “hybrid smart contracts” as combining on-chain and off-chain components securely. These hybrid contracts are what differentiates Chainlink from the thousands of other cryptocurrencies out there.

Chainlink saw a problem in the way smart contracts were previously operated as they were very limited in their uses, slow to execute, and overall expensive. So Chainlink decided to go all in on improving on the use cases for these contracts through the adoption of off-chain components to the blockchain. One of the use cases that Chainlink solved can be seen in the Crop Insurance example above.

Chainlink has been able to adopt this off-chain information through their DON’s, which enable them to offer these hybrid smart contracts. Chainlink still recognize that there is a long way to go to further improve on their technology and add new features like anonymity which they plan to address in the future.

Hybrid contracts are the first step involved in eventually reaching “meta contracts” which Chainlink believes will revolutionize the way in which we use crypto. Bringing us closer being able to transform the current monetary system into a digital one.

*Example:*

This kind of technology has various uses that can improve the efficiency for all parties involved. Once again, I will use an example from the Lex Fridman podcast with Sergey Nazarov, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXTmVdlyoc)

In this podcast Sergey pointed out that this confidentiality technology could be used in the data marketplace very effectively. This is because there is one party who is buying the data (person A); however this party does not know the quality of the data they are purchasing from the other party (person B). Based on this fact, person A does not want to pay for person B’s data because they do not yet know the quality, and Person B does not want to send the data over to person A for a quality check because then they would be giving it away for free. However, Chainlink’s smart contracts provide a solution to this problem because their smart contracts can work as an impartial agent, because of the fact that they can process off-chain data. This ensures that Person B gets paid and knows nothing about person A’s data algorithm, Person A gets their data automatically placed in their algorithm to keep person A’s data private.

This process would work like this:

· Person A provides their funds and states what data they are looking for

· Person B provides their data

o Chainlink assesses this data by taking random cross-sections of this data and internally assesses the quality and potential match based on Person A’s criteria.

o Chainlink determines the fair price of the data for both parties.

· If both parties agree upon the price, then the contract is executed and the transaction is approved.

***Confidentiality:***

Blockchains by their nature are very transparent. However, many people value confidentiality and would like to see some sort of confidentiality on the blockchain where it makes sense. This inherent transparency clashes with peoples desires for confidentiality and needs to be addressed in a way that makes sense for the users and for the blockchains.

Chainlink has proposed some ways in which they can implement confidentiality in their system to accommodate the need for confidentiality. These proposals include a combination of the following:

· *Confidentiality-Preserving Adapters:* Two technologies (DECO and Town Crier) enable oracle nodes to retrieve data from off-chain systems in ways that protect user privacy and data confidentiality.

· *Confidential Computation:* DON’s can conceal their computations from blockchains to a certain extent.

· *Supported Confidential Layer-2 Systems:* Many layer-2 systems use zero-knowledge proofs to provide various forms of transaction confidentiality.

This kind of confidentiality is very important to people and has many cases where it can be used effectively. Once again, I will use an example from the Lex Fridman podcast with Sergey Nazarov, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXTmVdlyoc)

The example that he gave was with health insurance companies in which he explained the following. Through Chainlink, you can have a smart contract that hold a person’s data and evaluates the data of the user (ie. Age, sex, medical history, medical conditions etc.) without sharing it to the insurance company. However, the insurance company will know that the smart contract will be able to effectively evaluate the patient properly and give them a policy with a price that fits their information. This solves the confidentiality worry about providing this data over the internet/blockchain and is only one example of a potential use case in which having confidentiality does not have an impact on the outcome of a result.

***Trust Minimization:***

Chainlink’s goal is to create a trustworthy layer of support for smart contracts through decentralization and crypto economic guarantees. This is because users favour a trust model for smart contracts made possible through Chainlink’s DON’s. Chainlink is always working on ways to improve their trustworthiness and security, and already have the following measures in place to ensure this right now.

· *Data-Source Authentication:* Data provides sign their data to ensure it is correct which helps to strengthen the relationship between the contracts and the data.

· *DON Minority Reports:* Flags can be issued and examined when there is malfeasance in the DON.

· *Guard Rails:* Detects anomalous conditions and halts the execution of the contract if it is suspicious.

· *Trust-Minimized Governance:* Gradual-release updates facilitate inspection and intervention in the case of a system failure.

Furthermore, there is incentives for people when they help to identify and solve cryptoeconomic security concerns.

***Chainlink Staking:***

Staking in Chainlink is very different from staking in other cryptocurrencies. Staking in Chainlink is aimed to ensure the timely delivery of correct oracle reports. Chainlink’s approach to staking is as follows:

1. *Adversarial Model:* Covers attacks that are overlooked, such as prospective bribery (bribing nodes)
2. *Super-Linear Staking Impact:* An adversary must have a budget greater than the combined deposits in all of the oracle nodes (which is large due to staking in these nodes)
3. *Implicit-Incentive Framework (IIF):* Chainlink’s incentive model that stretches beyond explicit, deposited, staking funds.

***Transaction Execution Framework (TEF):***

A TEF is an approach to the efficient execution of a Smart Contract across a mainchain and a DON. A TEF can support any layer-2 execution techniques, allowing it to process smart contract transactions. The TEF allows Chainlink to do so confidentially, with lower fees, and with higher performance. The TEF can do this because of the following functions:

· *Transaction Ingestion:* Executes, receives, or fetches user transactions through DON’s or the mainchain.

· *Fast Execution:* Processes transactions locally (on the DON)

· *Low-cost Oracle &amp; Adapter Access:* Reduced cost through off-chain oracle access (on-chain storage is expensive).

· *Syncing:* Periodically updates their smart contracts.

***Node Reputation and Performance History:***

Chainlink documents the performance histories of their nodes on the chain. Users can reference the past operations/performances of these nodes to make informed decisions. This decentralized compilation of accurate performing histories allows both users and operators to build their reputations to distinguish themselves on Chainlink’s network. Something like this can be very important in the future for insurance companies or any other companies adopt Chainlink’s technology, this is because users will be able to see the satisfaction scores and previous performances of these companies before they decide to do business.

An example may be an insurance company. By having performance histories, users can see if other users have been satisfied with their services, how many claims that they have settled, how many claims have been neglected, and how many customers this company serves. This gives very important information to the user, as they decide which company, they want to do business with. Furthermore, this history makes companies to compete for the best satisfaction and successful claims rate, in order to beat out their competition.

***Exciting News:***

Augur is launching a new platform to capture the quickly growing sports betting market. This new platform is called “Augur Turbo”. Augur has decided to use a combination of Polygon Matic $MATIC and Chainlink $LINK in order to decentralize their sports betting, reduce their fees, and improve their services.

Augur will use $MATIC to keep their fees low (due to their very low gas fees.

Augur will use $LINK for their Oracles, allowing them to transfer up-to-the-second, real-world data to the blockchain to help their increase their speed of adjusting the odds, updating the stats/scores, and paying their bettors out after the conclusion of their match(es).

***Key Definitions:***

· **Oracle:** An oracle sends data from off-chain sources (ie. Temperature information) to a blockchain, namely Ethereum, which then transforms it to on-chain data. This data is then used in applications like smart contracts.

· **Decentralized Oracle Networks (DON’s):** DON’s are formed by committees of oracle nodes that cooperate in order to fulfill a specific task to provide persistent services to clients. DON’s are a powerful tool that helps developers create off-chain support for smart contracts.

· **Verifiable Randomness:** Several types of developer applications require a verifiably correct source of randomness to enable verification. An example of this is a PoolTogether, where a promotion promises to give 5 lucky winners $50 in $LINK. This randomness will select these winners and automatically pay them out (via smart contracts) ensuring that their contest is legitimate and truly random.

· **Off-Chain:** Transactions, and/or data that takes place in the real world and can be put into a blockchain via Chainlink.

· **On-Chain:** This consists of transaction and/or data that is registered/recorded on some blockchain technology.

· **Smart Contract:** A Smart contract is a self-executing contract with terms that must be met by both sides for the contract to be executed. These contracts are traceable but irreversible. An example of this would be the sending me an automatic release of $50 in $LINK on my birthday. This smart contract would have to know my birth date, however once it does, a smart contract will execute every year on my birthday sending me this money.

· **Fixed Supply:** This means that there is a limit to the amount of supply, and that more supply of a coin cannot be created.

· **Fully Diluted Market Cap:** This refers to the market cap of a coin, given their maximum supply at current prices.

· **Node:** A node is a computer that connects and supports a given cryptocurrency network. The computer works on validating and relaying transactions onto the blockchain.

· **Oracle Node:** A committee of nodes with the goal of supporting/working alongside existing blockchains, rather than providing its own separate functionality.

· **Proof of Reserve:** Chainlinks Proof of Reserve (PoR) is the solution for maintaining end-to-end transparency for any platform utilizing backed/wrapped assets.

· **Keeper Network:** The Keeper Network is a decentralized network for projects that need software development and IT operations (DevOps) and eternal teams to find keeper networks (jobs).

· **Node Operators:** Chainlinks node operators are the backbone of their network. These operators participate in DON’s, allowing engineers to fetch external data securely/reliably via API’s. These operators are crucial for smart contracts and the real world data they need to use to run properly.

· **API’s (Application Programming Interface):** API’s provide real time data, by letting one software application to interact with another. Chainlink uses API’s to take real-time, and real-world data and transfer the into the blockchain through their DON’s.

· **Staking:** Actively participating in validating transactions, anyone who meets the minimum staking (balance) requirements can participate and earn rewards. Staking locks up your holdings and earns interest.

# About SHEN

[SHEN](https://www.google.com/search?q=shen+stock&amp;rlz=1C1GIVA_enDK879DK879&amp;oq=shen+stock&amp;aqs=chrome.0.35i19i39j69i57j69i60l3.1018j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), or Shenandoah Telecommunications Company is telecommunication company providing various broadband, wifi, fiber optic services. Totalling 1139\~ employees and being in business since 1902, you can see that we are talking about a company that has been around for some time, managed to adapt and be a relative success in oversaturated market.

SHEN has few major streams of revenue:

* Access, Local, and Fiber Lease
* Cable Service
* Wireless
* External revenues and investments

I won't go deep into the all of these streams, briefly what you need to know is that the Company has sold their wireless asset sale to T-Mobile US and is focusing more on their broadband infrastructure, further expanding their main source of revenue.

# Fundamentals

Remember reading [Intelligent Investor](https://www.google.com/search?q=intelligent+investor&amp;rlz=1C1GIVA_enDK879DK879&amp;oq=intelligent+investor&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j46j0j0i395l4j69i65.1819j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) or listening to any financial legend talking about P/E ratios, EPS, ROE and bunch of other things that you barely understood even though they seemed important ?

In the times when everything is priced in several years ahead, it's really hard to find a company with solid fundamentals, that is still going under the radar.

* Shares outstanding - 49.94 mil
* Market Cap - 2.84 B
* P/E - 17.24
* EPS - 3.30$
* Divi yield - 0.60%
* Avg. volume - 187K
* ROE - 29%

For a company in oversaturated market such as Telecommunications and controlled by giants such as T-Mobile, Verizon, Viacom, to keep such a great fundamentals is nothing but amazing. How did they achieve it ? Simple, while everyone was trying to dominate big cities and get the main piece of cake, SHEN was focusing on expanding their influence in the rural areas.

Let's sum up why these fundamentals are a good sign of a healthy company. Anything with P/E under 20 is almost a unicorn nowadays, everything is being priced in several years ahead and on potential that might not be there yet, while SHEN goes under the radar this entire time.

In Short, SHEN does better in fundamentals than most of the Industry respective to the company size.

What this all mean ? In the most simplistic way, with 52 Week 38.77-57.65 you can be certain that the company is not going away anytime soon, they have been around for more than 100 years, they are slowly expanding, sure it's not Google, it's not T-Mobile, but they are keeping it lowkey in the rural areas where there is still plenty of room to expand, opposite to the big cities where you have to rival the giant companies.

The company is beating expectations on quarterly basis.  


Regarding the potential market cap and share price targets. I believe the company just solely based on their fundamentals and stable revenue/earnings streams, could be worth much more. However, the average volume on the stock is barely 187K therefore it's been going under the radar for some time.

**Why there seem to be no interest in the stock?**

Even though it's only a speculation, we are living in the time where everybody wants to get rich quickly on the most notorious stocks or invest in the to known giants that took control over their respective industries. If you want something a growth stock, you can always just buy some giant company in the sector or just buy some index fund.

That could be one of the reasons why it's hard to notice a company that had been around for a long time, is growing in the rural areas, expanding, closing deals and makes sure there is a stable income/revenue stream. However, that does not change the fact that the company has much more potential and could be undervalued.  


#  SPECIAL DIVIDEND - $18.75 / Share

Now to the actual play. To be honest, I too haven't known about SHEN since this announcement, I had couple of dividend paying stocks, but this opportunity was too good to ignore.

SHEN is focusing more and more on their main revenue stream - broadband and decided to sell of their Wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile in an [insane sale](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shenandoah-telecom-declares-special-dividend-122122682.html). The sale totaled 1.94 billion dollars which at the time was almost the amount similar to the company's market cap.

SHEN is giving away 936.6mil of this sale back to the shareholders. ,making it 18.75$ per share, which is insane and will be payed out on August 2nd if you are a shareholder as of recorded date July 13th !

The rest of the proceeds they used to cover all of the debt and are expected more than 19.6mil to be reinvested back to the stock, further pumping the price up.

Why is it such a big deal ? If you didn't just skim through the fundamentals, you would have found out that the company's fair value is around 56$/share. What is it trading as of this moment ? 56.81$ so even despite the news of crazy special dividend, we are trading around the fair value of the company !  


**Will the share price will always rebalance itself after the payout date?**

Yes and no, in some cases it doesn't have to, but if you enter anywhere under the 70$ in order for you to lose money on this play, the stock would have dump close to their 52 week low. This is basically free guaranteed gain. You don't have speculate if Richard Branson reaches the Space or if Elon finally delivers on the self driving system. This is almost free win.

Just the fact that 19.6 mil is expected to be reinvested back. That's 345k shares bought at the current price, almost twice as much as your average daily volume. So even if the stock dumped right after the Dividend payout, you have guaranteed stock buybacks happening, all while the fundamentals and future outlook for the company is still holding strong.

**I don't know a lot about dividend stocks, how can I judge it ?**

One of the best metrics for the dividend stocks is to see if the company keeps increasing the dividend. Which they have continuously adjusted and kept increasing.

# Final Thoughts

Special dividends does not occur that often, they are here and there and can cause massive spike in the share price in the short amount of time while. Especially if the pay out is literally almost 1/3 of the entire market cap.

I believe that any entry below 70$ / share is still amazing because in order for this to go terrible, the stock would not only have to drop close to it's 52 Week low (38.77), but also stay there, all in while being fairly valued at $56/share

Moreover, selling a big portion of their assets to T-Mobile could make the company an acquisition target. Since they are popular in rural parts of the country, acquisition of SHEN could be an easy entry for any of the telecom giants to enter rural areas. Which in turn could further skyrocket the price, but that's purely a speculation.

I am planning on holding after the special dividend pay out with selling a small portion of the position on the dividend payout and holding rest for the longer term.

I would like to hear any opinions on this play, any bull/bear case is very welcome. Any criticism is welcome, let me know what you think !

# Buying Dates Disclaimer

Due to special dividend being greater than 25% of comapany's value. You would need to hold through the ex-dividend date in order to receive the dividend. Therefore you need to hold shares from 9.7.2021 through 3.8.2021 in order to receive the $18.75 special dividend.

There is a 2 day settlement period for transactions. Therefore your shares have to be settled in by this Friday (9.7.) the latest in order to receive the special dividend

# Possible play for traders who want it only short term:

Givens:  
\- SHEN share price $60 (right now)  
\- record date 7/13  
\- payable date 8/2  
\- ex-dividend date 8/3

Since the market takes 2 days to settle. The shares need to be purchased by Friday, July 9th to be on record with the company. Due to the circumstances of this special dividend, in order to receive payment, you need to hold through the ex-dividend date which means tying up funds for a little over 3 weeks.

**Play**:

Purchase shares in multiples of 100, and buy an equal amount of puts with a $55 strike price expiring on 8/20. These currently trade for approximately $2/contract ($200 is the full value of contract). If purchased correctly your maximum downside potential is $7/share, even if the stock price falls below $53 after the ex-dividend date. However, here’s the kicker. You are entitled to the full $18.75 special dividend because you held shares during the appropriate time frame. Therefore you are guaranteed to net approximately $11.75/share which is a return of 20% with little to no risk over the course of 3 weeks.

# TL;DR

Company paying out insane special dividend 18.75$/share on August 2nd if you hold shares before July 9th, while maintaining solid fundamentals.

5,investing,mexxmann,ETF Investment return questions,"Hello, I have two questions about investment returns of ETFs:

1. Taking the Yahoo finance performance page for QQQ ETF: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/qqq/performance?p=qqq](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/qqq/performance?p=qqq)  
What does the 3-Year return number mean?  I would have thought it would be something like the Time-weighed Return so using this example, the formula would be the following, using the returns for 2018, 2019, 2020: `(1 - .14) * (1 + .3912) * (1 + .4860) - 1 = .7779` (79.79%)  
However, the 3-year return on this page shows 26.20%.  I realize it is probably taking some of 2021 return data, but it I wouldn't expect the number to be that drastically different. It would likely be higher if anything.  
2. Is there an easy way to look at the 3, 5, 10 year time-weighed returns of ETFs? (the premise of the question assumes that I should be wanting to look at multi-year time-weighted returns when evaluating ETFs for investing across 10+ year horizons - please correct me if this is not the right way to look at things)
3. I use Questrade for trading these in an RRSP account.  I use the difference in balance for a given ETF between Dec 31 2019 and Dec 31 2020 to calculate my rate of return for 2020.  For my QQQ holding, I calculate 47.57% while on the yahoo finance page, 2020 shows as 48.60% for a diff of 1.03%. My DIA holding shows a discrepancy of 2.37%.  According to [https://etfdb.com/etf/QQQ/#expense](https://etfdb.com/etf/QQQ/#expense) and [https://etfdb.com/etf/DIA/#expense](https://etfdb.com/etf/DIA/#expense) the MERS are 0.20% and 0.16%.  I haven't made any deposits or withdrawals to these in the past couple years.  Are there other fees or factors that would contribute to the discrepancy?

""Do not use the words “Bullish” or “Bearish.” These words fix a firm market-direction in the mind for an extended period of time. Instead, use “Upward Trend” and “Downward Trend” when asked the direction you think the market is headed. Simply say: “The line of least resistance is either upward or downward at this time.” Remember, **don’t fight the tape**!"" - Jesse Livermore

8,investing,harsh25176,Got a question about The Big Short,"Got a question about The Big Short that has been bothering me: did Michael Burry and others make money by buying up credit default swaps (which I believe works like an insurance where you have to pay yearly premium and in case the homeowners default on their mortgages, the bank has to pay the amount to the buyers of the credit default swaps) or by short selling mortgage backed securities? because at the end of the movie, they were talking about ‘offloading before it’s too late’ which really confused me and I don’t get what’s they’re offloading if they just bought credit default swaps and I guess they just make money out of those swaps if there are defaulters so what are they short selling or offloading?",1625594299,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/of0bi7/got_a_question_about_the_big_short/

22,investing,Shyamallamadingdong,Redbubble (ASX: RBL) - My investment thesis and valuation,"Redbubble (ASX: RBL) is an Australian listed website and mobile app ([redbubble.com](https://www.redbubble.com/)) which acts as a marketplace for independent artists to showcase and sell their art on a wide assortment of formats (T-shirts, mugs, stickers, bedsheets, coasters etc). They have a market cap of AUD \~ 958mn (USD 721mn).

Redbubble is quite similar to another marketplace ETSY with a couple of exceptions: with ETSY, the artists creates the product an is responsible for producing and delivering to the buyer. Redbubble, on the other hand, handles all the production and delivery with the artist only needing to supply a digital format of their artwork . Redbubble's website allows the artist to choose which products their artwork gets printed on, while the company handling everything else.

They sell the following merchandise categories (% indicates FY20 marketplace revenue):

* T-shirts: 38%
* Stationary &amp; stickers: 17%
* Other apparel: 14%
* Accessories: 12%
* Artwork: 10%
* Homewares: 10%

They had high growth thanks to the COVID fueled eCom growth - YoY growth for all of these more that 30%, except for stationary &amp; stickers which grew at 21%

Source: [Redbubble 2020 Annual Report](https://shareholders.redbubble.com/annualreport/2020/12-13/)

Redbubble's take rate is 35-40% of the sale, while the artist gets 20% and the fulfillment partner gets 35-40%. The artist can also choose to increase his / her margin and list the product for a higher price (e.g. normal t-shirts sell for \~$20, but an artist can choose to list their t-shirt for $40 if they are well known, so they make more money on every sale). Redbubble has been growing at an impressive rate (40% revenue CAGR over the last 5 years). They also have zero debt and are free cash flow positive.

Their strategy is focused on a 3 part marketplace ""fly-wheel"":

1. Getting more **artists** on their site and making the artist experience as easy as possible
2. Getting more **buyers** on their site, both organically (artists drive their fans onto redbubble via their instagram and other social media pages) plus in-organically (redbubble markets their site on google so that it shows high up in search results for things like t-shirts, masks etc.)
3. Making sure their **fulfillment and production** partners make high quality products, the deliveries go out on time and the buyers get value for the money they are paying

**Management:**

The company was founded in 2006 by Martin Hosking, Peter Styles, and Paul Vanzella.  Martin Hosking is still the largest shareholder, and currently owns 16.4% of outstanding shares.

In June 2018, it was announced that Hosking would be stepping down as CEO. COO Barry Newstead, who has been with the company since 2013, would take over as CEO in August 2018. In October 2018, Redbubble acquired US-based peer [TeePublic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeePublic) for AUD 57.7 million. 

After Redbubble reported below-expectations performance in 2019, Newstead was asked to leave with Hosking replacing him as the ""interim"" CEO.

The 2 year search for a new CEO ended in Jan 2021, when Michael Ilczynski was hired for the role.  Ilczynski was a former CEO at SEEK (an online job site matching jobseekers and employers) where he spent 13 years. 

Institutional ownership stood at 48% and the general public owned 29% of outstanding shares. They have issued new shares in the past year to fuel their expansion, with total outstanding shares growing by 3.3%

**Catalysts for growth:**

Artists are looking to capitalize on the eCommerce growth to diversify their income streams and increase their passive income. Redbubble provides a great way to do this , as the artist just needs to upload their art on to the platform and link their Redbubble page on their social media channels. Redbubble also provides a boost, by marketing the site on google and other social media sites.

An artist can start selling almost instantly with zero capital required and no risk. Once the artists reaches a certain scale, they might choose to set up their own website and move to different production and distribution partners. However, I don't see this as a huge risk to Redbubble's long term prospects, as a good % of artists would still choose to use Redbubble's production and distribution networks and focus on producing art, which they are more interested in.

Even though I'm not an artists myself , I did set up an account and uploaded a [few simple designs](https://www.redbubble.com/people/AntifragileDC/shop?asc=u). Each design took around 5 minutes to upload, tag and select which products I wanted my designs to be listed on. Because it is such a risk-free and easy process, everyone with access to a computer can become a seller on Redbubble. However, this has also caused Redbubble a bit of trouble, with many sellers uploading content they don't own and stealing other artists' works. Redbubble [actively monitors this](https://help.redbubble.com/hc/en-us/articles/202270929-Community-and-Content-Guidelines) and tries to detect and take down any stolen content. 

Multiple influencers (such as  [Greg Gottfried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWFwKSEByw), [Wholesale Ted](https://www.wholesaleted.com/top-5-print-on-demand-websites/) &amp; [Kasey Golden ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdGCQntx4hs)) have used Redbubble to monetize their brands and huge online following to earn substantial amounts of passive income through the site. 

As long as Redbubble focuses on artists' needs , providing great production &amp; printing quality and making the process as seamless as possible, they will be able to retain and grow their 800k artist base. The average number of Instagram followers for personal accounts is 150 ([source](https://workmacro.com/instagram/follower-following-ratio-say-instagram-account/)). Hence, by my estimates, Redbubble already has an organic reach of \~120mn fans.

**Website ranking &amp; competition:**

redbubble.com has \~28mn monthly visits, out of which \~10% are directly from social media pages (the biggest ones being Pinterest, Youtube, Twitter and Reddit).

They have a few competitors (including Amazon who have starting to offer their own version of a ""print-on-demand"" store), but they had the advantage of being a first mover and also focus a lot on retaining and growing their artist base, so they have a market leading position and seem to be able to maintain this position even with a lot of new websites popping up offering similar services. Some artists also list their products on multiple sites (e.g. Redbubble, Threadless, Society6 and Amazon). There are some sites like printful and spreadshirt, which pursue a slightly different model - they do the printing and fulfillment, but artists need to set up their own page (using Shopify for example) to sell their artwork.  

In term of monthly site visits (28mn), they are 3\~4 times larger than their closest competitors: society6 and threadless, but way smaller than Etsy as seen below. They also own the US based teepublic.com, which has 8.1mn monthly visitors in May-2021.

Source: [similiarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/website/redbubble.com/?competitors=teepublic.com)

**Future growth and return on capital:**

I don't see Redbubble completely dominating this industry, but as long as they succeed in keeping their flywheel going, I expect them to grow by at least 10\~15% in the next decade (their own growth estimates are a bit more optimistic at 20-30%).

As they are a capital-light business, they have very respectable ROE (Return on Equity) and ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) of 31% and 36% respectively, which shows that the management has been allocating capital quite well.

They also have a strong balance sheet, with zero debt and AUD 129.7mn in cash.

**Summary and valuation**:

I think Redbubble are a high quality compounder who is just starting to scale and has a long runway ahead. They also follow Nick Sleep's ""scaled economy shared"" model to an extent: the bigger they get, the more products they add for artists and the more markets they can reach with the products (they still have a lot of untapped markets like China &amp; India) . One of the reasons I think they are not overpriced already is that they are listed mainly in Australia as of now and only have a US ADR as of now (RDBBY).

After their recent earnings report, their stock price took a big hit , as they did not provide solid guidance for 2021 and committed to spending heavily on search marketing going forward. However, as you can see in my DCF valuation below, considering conservative and pessimistic scenarios, they still look significantly undervalued. 

Valuation: [https://imgur.com/a/7b6QwU1](https://imgur.com/a/7b6QwU1)

**DCF calculation assumptions**:

* **Discount rate**: I've used 12% &amp; 14% as the discount rates in my conservative &amp; pessimistic scenarios
* **Annual revenue growth**: The conservative case assumes a 15% growth from 2021 to 2023 which slows down as Redbubble gets larger to 12.5% from 2024 to 2026 and finally 10% 2027 onwards. My pessimistic case assumes they only grow at half this rate until 2030.
* **Terminal value**: I've used 10x and 8x in my conservative &amp; pessimistic scenarios. Redbubble's current EV/FCF is 9.8, while ETSY, who has a comparable business model, trades at an EV/FCF of  48
* **FCF margin:** Redbubble is a purely tech business, hence it does not require significant capital expenditure. Their major expenses are marketing and improving their systems / processes - both of which will reduce as a % of revenue as the scale becomes larger. Hence, for the conservative case , FCF margin starts at 12% in 2021 and goes up to 16% by 2030, while in the pessimistic case, it reduces from 12% in 2021  to 6% in 2030 
* **Margin of safety:** I've assigned equal probability to the conservative and pessimistic case, as Redbubble does have a lot of competition and a lot of the performance will come down to how well the management executes. My conservative case values the business at AUD 1.98bn, while the pessimistic case values it at  AUD 0.535bn. Equally weighted, that brings my estimated value to  AUD 1.258bn , which presents a margin of safety of 72% from current enterprise value (AUD 0.732bn).

**Potential risks:** 

* **COVID growth may not be sustainable:** Redbubble have had huge tailwinds due to increased eCommerce during COVID and sales of masks on the site. Hence, volume growth may slow down in the next few quarters
* **Product quality:** their product quality &amp; printing quality declines or some of their key suppliers have quality issues. Redbubble needs to constantly monitor quality to make sure this doesn't happen
* **High competition**: Amazon or one of their other competitors aggressively spends on marketing and discounts, eating into redbubble's user base as well as margins. Also, Redbubble's logistics and distribution is not as developed as Amazon and it focuses on fewer countries at the moment. Shipping to ""non-core"" countries (countries other than North America, EU, UK and Australia) from Redbubble comes with long lead time and high shipping costs.
* **Artists infringe on brands and copyrights:** in the terms of use for artists, the responsibility lies with the artist to ensure their posting don't infringe on copyrights. Redbubble polices for infringement as well as takes down any infringement when notified. The interesting dynamic is many brands are okay with artists using brand images as passionate fans are buying brands they care about.
* **Offensive content:** They have had cases in the past where artists have posted racist and obscene images on their site, causing significant public outrage. Redbubble have been forced to remove content on multiple occasions due to this.
* **Multiple management changes**: The management team has had multiple changes in the last few years with the founder Hoskins coming in and out of the CEO role multiple times. The current CEO, Michael Ilczynski, is only 6 months into the role, so he has yet to prove that he can continue to scale Redbubble and keep the flywheel going.

**Conclusion**:

Redbubble has established a sustainable marketplace fly-wheel and has solid fundamentals which should fuel its growth over the next 5\~10 years. They do face high competition and other risks, but I think their current valuation and upside potential provides sufficient incentives for long term focused investors.

I've initiated a position recently, with Redbubble representing around 10% of my current portfolio - I'm planning to hold for at least 5\~10 years. Let me know what you think in the comments! ",1625585824,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oexebw/redbubble_asx_rbl_my_investment_thesis_and/

26,investing,valuescott,Canadian Pacific Company Profile and Developments,"I will be referring to them as CPR

## Summary if you don’t want to read a lot

CPR has some good things going for it, but in general the outlook is bland.  They have some deep problems, and they don’t manage money well.  Rating: Do not buy, but maybe hold.

## Company Summary

Canadian pacific is a transcontinental railway headquartered in Calgary, Alberta and founded in 1881.  They transport bulk commodities, merchandise freight, and retail goods.  They also are engaged in marine shipping, although this is a secondary business.  They have 13,000 Miles of track across North America and own 22.9K freight cars and lease 12.2K.  They own 1336 Locomotives and lease 76.

I grew up with someone whose dad was an engineer for them.  He said they treated him like shit and he was never home to spend time with my friend.  I think his job at CPR was the reason he divorced his wife.  Workers are non unionized. This goes to show that CPR can make the most out of their workers.

They have one operating segment: rail transportation.  The subsegments of this are bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic (transported multiple ways like train -&gt; boat).

**Management Overview:**

The CEO has been in the business for 29 years. Only 55% of employees approve of him on glassdoor.  The CFO has over 20 years of experience but there is something wrong with his teeth.  The sentiment from glassdoor is that there is no respect for employees, especially at the lower level.  The management has done a good job keeping the company running well, but they are neglecting their human capital.  I have nothing bad to say about the COO.  He seems well qualified and his teeth are more normal.

**Board Overview:**

[LINK](https://www.cpr.ca/en/about-cp/board-of-directors)

The board looks like the husbands and wives of wealthy politicians who all meet up once a week to play bridge.  Only 411 have past railway experience.  There are a lot of finance people on the beard, which is good and bad.  On one hand they will have good advice on capital structure, but less on general operations.  

## Company history

They have a long complicated history that includes a lot of death and a lot of labour so dangerous and cheap it was pretty much slavery. But all of that history won’t have much impact on current operations.

In 2020, they acquired the Central Maine and Quebec railway.  This added 481 Miles to their track.

In the third quarter of 2020, they acknowledged climate change.

In 2020 they announced that they would be working on the development of a hydrogen locomotive.  If it gets working, they will have to retrofit old locomotives with the new technology.  I am not sure how cost effective this is.

They recently bid and failed to buy Kansas city southern.  I see this as a big loss.  This could have brought their track miles up to almost 20000 and would give them a line direct from canada through to mexico.  It would have been a 25 Billion dollar deal.

## Risk

When I think about risk I tend to not look at the risk section in a 10K right away.  CPR talked about the risk of transporting hazardous goods, environmental stuff, terrorism and war before they talked about supply chain and human capital risk.  Seriously!  If one of their trains blows up, they might lose 4 engineers, 100M of goods and assets, and cause 200M in damage MAX.  This money doesn't mean anything to them.  They're just trying to follow the trend of hyping up pointless risks while downplaying the real ones.  The risks below are all from me, not from what the company has put in their risk section.

CPR is uniquely exposed to economic risk.  Its business is directly dependent on supply and demand.  In prosperous times, there will be a lot of goods and commodities to transport, but in a slow economy, there will be less need for CPR, so they will follow along with the unfavorable economic conditions.  Not as severe as seasonality.  Naturally there are periods of high and low demand throughout the year, so CPR experiences seasonal sales and earnings fluctuations.  

Because they lost the Kansas city bid to CNR, CPR is more vulnerable to CNR - CNR has more capability to bring goods where they need to be, so clients will probably favour them.  

I don't see railways going anywhere soon.  Trucking is much more expensive for now - but there is a risk that in the near future it becomes much much cheaper.  This could disrupt CPR and potentially render them useless.  Sure this is improbable but still something to think about.

The way they treat their employees is a liability.  60 hours of work in 7 days is rough for anyone, and the lack of work life balance is a sure way to keep the employees miserable.  If the employees decide to strike or demand less hours and higher pay, the business could be severely disrupted.

## Revenue Breakdown / Company segments

The subsegments of this are bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic.

The breakdown of the segments is as follows:

[Bulk commodities](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g7.jpg):  43% ([Grain](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g10.jpg), [coal](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g13.jpg), [potash](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g16.jpg), [fertilizers](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g19.jpg))

[Merchandise freight](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g22.jpg): 36% ([Cars](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g34.jpg), [forest products](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g25.jpg), [energy and chemical products](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g28.jpg), [metals](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g31.jpg))

[Intermodal traffic](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16875/000001687521000008/cp-20201231_g37.jpg): 21% (Moving containers around. Doesn't matter what's inside)

These segments are very well diversified.  I would be here for weeks talking about the different business sediments here so instead I added links and sublinks to the breakdowns of categories and subcategories.

Two percent of their revenue comes from non-freight.  This is related to fees for their tracks, leases, and random arrangements.

## Industry position

Relative analysis. Ratios, competitors, market share

By track length, CPR is the sixth largest north american railway.  They are also the sixth largest railroad by revenue in north america. 

Of the 10B+ market cap railroads, CPR is the fifth largest and they have the lowest PE out of all of them.  They have a yield of .79 which is lower than average.  Their PS, Profit margins and PB are very competitive. On the surface they look relatively undervalued - I will go deeper into their financial to see if they are intrinsically undervalued.  

## Company base statistics

Market Cap: 51 B

Total Debt: 6B

Cash &amp; Liquid assets: 219M

Goodwill:336M

Total Assets: 23B

Equity:7.3B

Revenue:7.6B

Earnings:2.6B

Operating Cash Flow:2.8B

Enterprise Value:61B

Shares Outstanding:680M

EV/Sales:8x

ROE: 35.5% (Not much of this makes it to equity)

## Overview/Growth and Developments

Growth:  

* Revenue has stayed relatively stable.  It fluctuates over 5 year time frames, probably following macroeconomic trends.  
* Earnings have had some pretty good growth.

Margins/ratios: 

* Profit margin is growing with earnings.  
* Past 7 years have had +20% margins every year

Net reinvestment:

* They don't have great credit ratings - average BBB+
* They don't have any paper R&amp;D, but they have claimed that they are working on some pretty interesting tech to reduce locomotive emissions and hopefully operational costs

Share buybacks:

* \# of shares is constantly going down.  They are adding great shareholder value over time from this.

Costs:

* Costs and expenses are low.  This gives them a lot of opportunity to invest back into the company - which it doesn't seem like they are doing even with a 30%+ profit margin

Debts: 

* Their debt is not sustainable based on traditional debt structure analysis, but their earnings easily cover it.  
* They seem to have recently been issuing less debt
* They are issuing debt with very high interest, which is reckless.  The bond market is looking for good yield but there is no need to commit over 6 percent - CPR is committing over 9% interest rate on some 30 year issues.  Why would they do that??  Maybe because the CFO did not brush his teeth so people don't want to hear him explain why he is acting recklessly
* They are adequately covered for repayments in the next five years.  2021 is the worst year with 1.178B due - but it is not very concerning.

Assets:

* Most assets are in equipment (Trains) and property (Tracks)
* They have a tiny cash reserve.  Tiny.  If it wasn't for their split and consistent cash flow generated from operations this would take down the company very fast.  They really need to build this up instead of issuing 30 years of debt at 9%+

Legal: Nothing worth noting

Recent/expected developments: 

* There was a recent oil spill that CPR had something to do with.  A small 32 000 Litres.  There is a possibility that this gets way blown out of proportion and their stock loses, but unlikely.

## Catalysts/Entry points

* An employee revolt would be good for non-owners. We would get a chance to buy when the market outlook is low
* A large environmental disaster would probably obliterate the stock price for a few days presenting a good time to buy in.
* It is possible but unlikely that they will get acquired.  They have good operations but some obvious problems. An acquisition would fix this.

## Valuation

Their market value is probably pretty close to their intrinsic value.  I was hesitant with a DCF, but came up with a little bit under the market value.  Their margin of safety can be assumed to be nil.

## Valuation Market Comparison

All of the railroads seem to be sitting between a little bit undervalued and decently overvalued.  CPR is fitting in nicely here.

## Opinion

If you have it already - fine, it could be a solid hold for now.  There is some good cash generation here that seems to be lost before it becomes cash.  But c’mon.  Were retail investors.  This company will not make us rich, and might even make us poor.  There are better places for us to put our money.  I would give this a “Warning: you will probably lose money with $CP” sticker and a weak sell rating.

## Notes and sources

Notes:

Note 1. I am not a financial advisor.  This is my opinion not my recommendation.  Do your own research.

Note 2: I do not hold $CP in my portfolio and I will not profit in the event that their shares gain or lose value.

Stock price is trading at a premium.

**The Details**

They own three growing players in the food delivery market(look them up) and are only expanding YoY. They have 3 great technology platforms that they can use in the game, or pivot to something else. They had a $7 million increase from last Q1 to this Q1, and are locking down partnerships and sponsorships with people like Drew Brees, and large restaurant chains.

Marketing spend is going up, so they clearly are prioritizing market share, and it clear that they are finding success. They are the only delivery service where revenue exceeds operating costs!

Oh, did I mention that they are looking to pioneer in the THC, CBD delivery market?

DIDI -22.73% went public in the U.S., China’s cybersecurity watchdog suggested the Chinese ride-hailing giant delay its initial public offering and urged it to conduct a thorough self-examination of its network security, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

But for Didi, waiting would be problematic. In the absence of an outright order to halt the IPO, it went ahead.

The company, facing investor pressure to list after raising billions of dollars from prominent venture capitalists, wrapped up its pre-offering “roadshow” in a matter of days in June—much shorter than typical investor pitches made by Chinese firms. The listing on the New York Stock Exchange raised about $4.4 billion, making it the biggest stock sale for a Chinese company since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.27% ’s IPO in 2014.

Back in Beijing, officials, especially those at the Cyberspace Administration of China, remained wary of the ride-hailing company’s troves of data potentially falling into foreign hands as a result of greater public disclosure associated with a U.S. listing, the people said.

34,investing,TheStonksHub,The Weekly DD - Full Robinhood (HOOD) S-1 Analysis and Breakdown,"**Overview**

As infamous as Robinhood may be, the company has seen solid growth over the last 6 quarters. This growth, lead by covid lockdowns and the rise of the Gamestop saga most likely sped up the process of the average Joe becoming acclimatized to trading from their pocket.

Although this growth was unexpected, there was another phenomenon that set Robinhood up for the layup. This was the fact that the average retail trader is becoming more and more educated on trading equities, options, and cryptocurrencies. What was once a risky thing to do has now become almost standardized in a short period of time. Let’s go through some of the key-stats for the company.

**Business Model**

The full range of what “Robinhood Markets” (RHM) does is structured into 3 subsidiaries: Robinhood Financial (RHF), Robinhood Securities (RHS), and Robinhood Crypto (RHC). The combined products offer:

* Trading/brokerage services for US listed stocks and ETFs
* Crypto trading through subsidiary, Robinhood Crypto LLC
* Fractional trading
* Recurring investments
* Cash management (debit cards, paying bills, writing checks)
* Robinhood gold - Subscription based model for premium features: professional research, level 2 market data, margin investing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Key Stats**

Net cumulative funded accounts: 18.0m

Monthly Active Users (MAU): 17.7m

Assets under custody (AUC): $81b

First time investors: &gt;50%

Organic or referred customers: 80%

Robinhood Snacks Newsletter + Podcast: 32 million subscribers

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenues**

*Comparing FY 2020 to FY 2019*

Revenues from for FY 2020 were 960m versus 277m for FY 2019, 245% increase. Comparing the same time period operating expenses increased 150%.

Net cumulative funded accounts grew 143%

Monthly Active Users grew 172%

Assets Under Custody grew 346%

Average revenue per user grew 66%

&amp;#x200B;

*Comparing Q1 2020 to Q1 2019*

For the 3-months ended in Q1 2021 net revenues were 522m versus 127m for Q1 2020, a 300% increase. Comparing the same quarters operating expenses saw a 250% increase.

Net cumulative funded accounts grew 150%

Monthly Active Users grew 106%

Assets Under Custody grew 317%

Average revenue per user grew 65%

&amp;#x200B;

*Segmentation of Assets Under Custody*

Equities: 80.3%

Options: 2.48%

Crypto: 14.32%

Cash: 9.46%

Less - Customer Margin: (6.67%)

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenues - Broken Down by Segment (most recent quarter)**

Transaction-based revenues: 81% (payment for order flow (PFOF)\* + other)

Net Interest Revenues: 12% (lending activities/margin borrowers)

Other Revenues: 7% (robinhood gold, proxy rebate revenue)

&amp;#x200B;

\*PFOF makes up 75% of TOTAL REVENUES for Robinhood, broken down by the following market-makers.

Citadel: 34%

Susquehanna International Group &amp; Subsidies: 18%

Wolverine Holdings &amp; Subsidies: 10%

Others: 13%

This 75% of total revenue in 2020 is up from 2019’s PFOF percent of total revenues of 62%

&amp;#x200B;

**Operating Expenses - Broken Down**

Brokerage &amp; Transaction: 12%

Technology &amp; Development: 22%

Operations: 14%

Marketing: 19%

SG&amp;A: 31%

&amp;#x200B;

**Robinhood’s Current Focus**

* Customer acquisition: significant opportunity in continued customer acquisition/referral program.
* New product offerings to existing customers (growing with the customer)
* Technological innovation: product development, educational content, technology and infrastructure improvements, customer support.
* International expansion (Europe and Asia)

**Opportunities**

* Approximately 60% of Americans do not invest outside retirement accounts.
* 68% of adults aged 18-29 do not invest at all.
* Estimated that total assets in the investable market that exists for retail investors is approximately 50 trillion (Charles Schwab estimate).
* Robinhood’s cash management service highly complementary service to what they currently offer. They’ve also vertically aligned every aspect of their business model to stay within the Robinhood ecosystem.

**Risks**

* Experienced huge growth 2020/2021, might not be able to maintain growth.
* 2020 they were net profitable, but might not maintain profitability in the future.
* PFOF payment for order flow is dependent on market activity. Any bans on PFOF or regulation moving forward could reduce profitability and expand potential negative publicity.
* Systematic market risk to economic and political conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Underwriting**

Notable underwriters of the IPO:

Goldman Sachs

JP Morgan

Barclays

Citigroup

Wells Fargo

&amp;#x200B;

**LockUp Expiration**

According to the table below taken from the S1, 15% of the class A shares will be available for sale in the public market **on the first trading day** after being listed on the Nasdaq.

Another 50% of class A shares will be available for trade on the “tranche I release date”, described in the S-1 as: “during the period beginning on the date of this prospectus and ending 28 days after the effective date of the Form S-1 resale registration statement that we have agreed to file in respect of such shares”

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

Robinhood has (obviously) been the beneficiary from not only covid lockdowns and the adoption of the stay-at-home retail trader, but also from the exposure they received during the Gamestop short-squeeze. They are growing incredibly fast on all key stats and metrics that include cumulative funded accounts, monthly active users, and net assets under custody. To put things in perspective in a stellar 2020 they did roughly 1 billion in revenues and so far in Q1 2021 alone they’ve already done 522 million (on pace for 2 billion revenues for fiscal year 2021). Their bottom-line is teetering between net-profitability and net-loss and management has said it is uncertain which side of the coin net revenues will fall on in future quarters (short-term).

Having said that, from the S-1 management also see’s growth continuing with a large share of the market still being un-tapped. Their biggest opportunities lie in the fact that 60% of Americans do not trade outside of their retirement accounts and majority of young-adults aged 18-29 still do not invest at all (the median customer age is 31 years old). Robinhood also has a lot of room to grow in international markets, mainly Europe and Asia.

Going off the data from previous years and looking at how Robinhood scales as they grow. It seems that on average for every $1 in revenue the company grows in scale, operating expenses will increase by approximately 75 cents. The most notable *increase* in expense for Robinhood has been their technological and development expense. This is understandable as the company has been scrutinized for when their services have gone down at seemingly inconvenient times for retail traders.

Lastly, the biggest risk for Robinhood is their PFOF component which constitutes nearly 75% of total revenue. Robinhood’s business model relies on PFOF and any regulation on that segment would put their business at risk.",1625578390,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oev0k3/the_weekly_dd_full_robinhood_hood_s1_analysis_and/
37,investing,AwesomeMathUse,The Role of Binance in Bitcoin Volatility Transmission,"[Source](https://www.resistance.money/research/binance_volatility_transmission.pdf)

Abstract

We analyse high-frequency realised volatility dynamics and spillovers in the bitcoin market, focusing on two pairs: bitcoin against the US dollar (the main fiat-crypto pair) and trading bitcoin against tether (the main crypto-crypto pair). We find that the tether-margined perpetual contract on Binance is clearly the main source of volatility, continuously trans- mitting strong flows to all other instruments and receiving only a little volatility. Moreover, we find that (i) during US trading hours, traders pay more attention and are more reac- tive to prevailing market conditions when updating their expectations and (ii) the crypto market exhibits a higher interconnectedness when traditional Western stock markets are open. Our results highlight that regulators should not only consider spot exchanges offer- ing bitcoin-fiat trading but also the tether-margined derivatives products available on most unregulated exchanges, most importantly Binance.",1625576005,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oeubqj/the_role_of_binance_in_bitcoin_volatility/

52,investing,iprovo,Ethical investing - an oxymoron or an important responsibilty?,"I came across many articles that praise businesses that did extremely well over the last century and usually strongly recommend investing in them. Many times the common denominator of all such businesses are questionable ethical practices at best and plain murder at worst.

Altria and CocaCola are two companies often mentioned im such context. Both have a stellar historical performance and unmatched dividend payout history. That being said, Altria earns all of its income through tobacco products that are very well known to be extremely harmful and very addicting. Cocacola started off with selling literal cocaine. See where I am getting at?

Not really a problem having ""solid fundamentals"" when you are pushing addictive drugs, is it? That being said, both above mentioned corporations have some very unethical practices on record including but not limited to massive funding of research solely intended to cover up the harmful effects of their products and inciting violence in the developing world throigh politics.

Same goes with some pharmaceutical companies like J&amp;J that did great but spent millions if not billions on covering up known and dangerous side effects of its patented drugs (hyperprolactinemia from risperidone for example). A similar problem is also very prominently present in other sectors like energy where companies destroy indigenous communities for midstream piplines and so on...

And we as shareholders are (at least partly) responsible for (at least some of the) harmful practices that are carried out mostly to ensure future revenue

So my question is, do you guys ever consider the ethical implications of owning a share of a certain company? And if you do, where do you draw the line?",1625566371,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oes1i2/ethical_investing_an_oxymoron_or_an_important/

56,investing,PheonixStarr,Billionaire Space Race + Trickle-down on relevant industries?,"I had a thought. Not a good thought, but a thought nonetheless.

Bezos &amp; Branson are currently having their own little mini-space race right now. Assuming they're successful and return alive, I wonder if this might start a trend of the global 1% all clamoring to get themselves to the great black void?

If so, I also wonder if we can expect modest growth for all the various companies and industries that go into bringing a human into space. A wild amount of contractors are involved in engineering and constructing a space vehicle--not to mention their suits, life support, and all the coordinators &amp; logistics that would go into pulling off such an astronomically massive project (pun not intended). Each time somebody insanely rich goes into space, they inject millions of dollars into each industry involved, all the way down to foundries forging their steel and mines pulling aluminum from the ground.

I thought NASA contractors might be a good indication of which companies are involved with spaceflight. I referenced a non-comprehensive list and picked a few that I recognized:

* Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc (AJRD)
* Boeing (BA)
* Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH)
* Lockheed Martin (LMT)
* Maxar Technologies (MAXR)
* MDA Ltd. (MDA)
* Honeywell (HON)
* ITT Inc (ITT)
* Héroux-Devtek Inc (HRX, traded on TSX)
* Teledyne Technologies Inc (TDY)
* QinetiQ (QNTQY, traded OTC)
* Jacobs Engineering Group Inc (J)
* and ofc Branson's Virgin Galactic (SPCE)

Honorable mentions go to Musk's SpaceX &amp; Bezos' Blue Origin, should they go public. I do recognize that most of these corporations are very diversified in their offerings, and may grow due to other reasons anyway.

96,investing,Roostea,OPEC holding off increasing supply,"The dispute between UAE and the rest of OPEC has come to a halt with both sides failing to meet an agreement. I think this is a great short term catalyst to the oil trade. The futures for Brent and WTI are near their yearly highs and I see this sticking for the near term.

Tuesday we may see a rally in oil companies and stocks as the price of oil doesn't seem to have much reason to come down, other than the unlikely scenario of a price war between the countries in OPEC. I do not feel like this will happen.

Before the long weekend I sold my July 16 Exxon calls. Probably shouldn't have, but I took my profits and put them into January Halliburton and SLB calls. Hopefully I didn't bite myself in the ass, given the news, I bet my itm Exxon calls would've done well tomorrow, although they were 10 dte. I erred on the side of caution with that call, fearing theta would take majority of my gains.

I doubt we will see energy dip tomorrow and I expect american companies to see modest gains actually, since OPEC doesn't seem to be raising supply at this surge in demand. If energy does decide to dip into tomorrow, I will be a buyer.

The OIH should see good gains in this news, as well as the XLE. The companies I am choosing to play this with are Exxon, Devon, Suncor, Halliburton, and Schlumberger. I have shares of Exxon, and 6 month calls on everything else. I am very overweight this trade.

I still believe there will be room to run on this trade and I think we may see peak prices in December, when many are going to travel for the winter. The other catalyst being Europe's reopening, which is still relatively early, catching steam and putting the oil market on fire.

I wasn't a big believer in $100 a barrel, and I plan to exit my side of the trade before the price gets there, but I see it as more of an upside risk now due to the latest OPEC news.

Good luck oil bulls, so far, everything is going as planned and better![ ](https://cov.etnomatematica.org/videos-xop-z-bra-v-a02.html)

97,investing,gawizneigs,Small/medium cap value stocks are worth a look,"I'm a relatively new and young investor, but I've been migrating a large portion of my IRA into small/medium cap value in the form of VBR (considering viov or avuv). I have looked at many of the holdings in VBR, not necessarily the numbers/stats but the companies themselves and what they do. 

They're not the companies that many would expect to be at the forefront of changing the world right now (more involvement with basic household products, components, chemicals, and infrastructure) and not so much information technology. I honestly don't see this as a bad thing, and I feel like these fields still have so much to gain from advances in automation and technology in general over the long-term, perhaps even more so than IT companies. After all, creating a website/app is less complex than  chemical engineering, or even running a bank efficiently. It will take time for these companies to show their true potential. 

Yes VBR, VIOV and similar etfs have done much worse than the sexier tech filled etfs over the last decade, but that has resulted in them being relatively cheap considering how crowded the stock market is as a whole right now.",1625524107,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oehwi7/smallmedium_cap_value_stocks_are_worth_a_look/

0,investing,satchelsofgold,"Stock delisted, how do I assert my stockholder rights?","So a stock I invested in got delisted last year. They went private on purpose. It is an Irish based (but actually mostly US) company called Mainstay Medical. If all goes well they'll most likely go public again at some point in the future, most likely with a US listing.

Now my EU based broker (DeGiro) kept the stock listed in my account for the shares I own (worth a couple of thousand euro's when i bought them), but the worth was set to zero and it was marked non-tradeable. I was told by customer service the line was still in my account because ""our custodian still keeps the record of stockholders"".

Now fast forward 15 months and they removed the line from my account today. So basically I now feel pretty vulnerable and like I need to make sure my ownership of the shares can still be proven and remains intact. Of course I sent my broker an e-mail already and waiting for a response, but I would appreciate some more input. I'm pretty sure my broker can basically tell me to figure it out myself now, because they have nothing to do with this company anymore. 

So my question is, does anybody have experience in this field and know the proper course of action for me? There is lots of info on Google about stock delistings, but I find nothing about how to assert your rights when you're all of a sudden a private shareholder. Who even keeps the record or knows who owns which shares at this point? I guess I can simply contact the company myself, but I would like to know what I need from them before I do that.",1625522002,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oeh9b5/stock_delisted_how_do_i_assert_my_stockholder/
1,investing,mrtdott,Why the world doesn’t need Bitcoin,"1. It is not a hedge against inflation: 

As a hedge against inflation, there are better alternatives. Equities, Real estate, commodities etc. All of which are regulated and more secure. The recent fall in Bitcoin’s price - at the same time inflation fears are at the highest in decades - proves it is not a useful tool to hedge against inflation.

2. It has no value as “money”, because it is not accepted for taxes:

Although people generally refer to the USD as “fiat”, it’s true value comes from taxes. 300M+ of some of the wealthiest people on earth, are mandated by their govt to pay their taxes in USD. That gives it its value. Even a non-American understands that other Americans would accept it, so it has value to non-Americans. People use USD a unit of account, because it is easier to transact in the same unit of account for which taxes would be paid.

Contrary to popular belief, taxes made Gold valuable as money. Not just it’s metallic properties. If the Roman Empire had requested taxes be paid in copper, lead, etc all Roman citizens would have had to sell a portion of their Gold for the acceptable tax payment commodity. Eventually, it would have been too inconvenient to transact in Gold, just to have to exchange it to something else each year. And people would inevitably have changed their unit of account to the form accepted for taxes. Gold had other useful properties, like scarcity. But ultimately, it was used as the unit of account, because it was the method of payment for taxes.

3. As a currency, it is deflationary: 

While deflation can be a good property for an asset, this is a terrible feature for a currency. When a currency is deflationary, it removes the need for investments. Why would a business owner spend the currency to build a new factory or hire more workers, if they can simply hold on to their currency? No need for new factories, new innovation, new investment in that scenario. A currency needs to have some predictable ‘moderate’ inflation, because it forces people to invest it into the real economy. Or risk it losing its value. These investments - like a new factory - create job as well as useful products.

4. There are cheaper more secure ways to transfer money:

Venmo, Apple Pay, Cash app etc are much safer and secure way to process transactions. Between exchange fees, miners fee, volatility. The cost to transact in Bitcoin is not nearly as low as people think.

5. Developing countries have better options:

Bicoiners would argue that developing countries have many citizens that are “unbanked”. And would benefit from access to cryptocurrencies. However, developing countries are able to use more stable currencies like the USD or the Euro. This is especially useful for countries with hyperinflation - different from earlier mentioned ‘moderate’ inflation. There are already phone apps - outside the normal banking system- that allow people to complete transactions in developing countries.",1625521941,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oeh8l0/why_the_world_doesnt_need_bitcoin/
2,investing,korengalois,Timing Traditional 401K -&gt; Roth IRA conversion,"I recently left a high paying job ($200k) where I contributed to a traditional 401K for about 2 years (balance is \~50k). I also have a Roth IRA (balance \~150k). I'm taking a short (voluntary) break between jobs to travel and anticipate my next job will be around 300k total compensation.

My question is - should I take advantage of my (comparatively) low income in 2021 to take the tax penalty associated with this conversion? I say low because I'll be not working for around 4 months. By contrast, if I waited until 2022 to convert this sum to my roth IRA my tax bracket will be significantly higher. Lastly, I don't really know if I should even convert this 50k to my roth IRA. My original reasoning was that I expected my 200k income would exceed my retirement income (therefore I'd be taking advantage of the tax rate differential), but I no longer remain confident that my retirement income will be that low.

10,investing,NickiNicotine,Investing in homes with Airbnb demand,"One of the downsides of (owner-occupied) home ownership is obviously that you're tied to the property insofar as you do not have the flexibility to migrate or travel as easily as you can on a year-long or month to month lease, other liabilities of home ownership i.e. risks of not paying mortgage, going underwater, etc. notwithstanding. Additionally, many HOAs prohibit short-term rentals a la Airbnb.

One of the investment notions that occurred to me was looking at something like AirDNA to determine where the demand is (or isn't) for short-term rentals and then using that as (part or most of) your purchasing criteria, so that if you want to, say, fuck off to travel for a few months you are not having to finance *two* living arrangements, as you normally would.

What are the down-side risks to taking this approach beyond the ones I'm listing below?

So far I can think of:

1. tenants damaging your home, although I assume that would be covered by the short-term-rental merchant's insurance less a deductible
2. (1a.) additional wear and tear on your home and appliances, furniture. which would probably not be covered by the merchant's insurance, although you could buy extended warranties on some stuff
3. You could potentially pay a premium for purchasing in an area with high short-term rental (STR I'll call it) demand outside of the regular premium you would pay for living near a beach, etc.
4. Your local government could ban STRs, as has been attempted and probably accomplished (off the top of my head I know parts of San Diego were trying this)",1625519010,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oegb65/investing_in_homes_with_airbnb_demand/
17,investing,MvCSpiderman,Best Brokerage suggestions with instant deposits/withdraws and options trading?,"Hello, I am looking to for a new brokerage site/app to use for my investments. I am looking for one that has fast deposits so I can get started fast, with instant or quick access to options trading. It would also be great if I could withdraw without long waits as well. I want to avoid any hidden fees or wait times.

I dont care if it's a Bank or investment org/firm as long as it's not some sketchy alley company with little info, otherwise I'll accept any suggestions.

EXCEPTIONS:

1. NO ROBINHOOD. I am in the middle of a dispute with them and I have no intention of using them.

2. No Chase bank. Their app &amp; desktop is slow, there's a 4 'business day' wait before you can trade options, and withdrawls can in some cases be 1 day or up to 3 days. It also takes 1-2 days to deposit from an outside bank, that's on top of the 4 day wait which means you could be waiting 6 days to trade.

3. No Schwab or TD due to a separate issue going on with them currently. But may use them in the future, but not now.

4. No Tasty, the UI is uneven and inconsistent, it's a pain to use with mobile and desktop is poorly labeled and slow.

I'm open to any suggestions, though cheap to free options would be preferred. A decent interface also isn't required but if your suggestion has one great! That just makes things better.

Being able to get started the same day or within 48 hours is an additional plus.

Let me know of any standout pros and cons of your suggestion I should know. I appreciate your input.",1625516855,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oefm4r/best_brokerage_suggestions_with_instant/
18,investing,valuescott,TD Due Diligence and characteristics," 

TD:

TD is the sixth largest bank in north america.  They have over 26 million customers.  Their main operations are:

* Canadian retail (TD canada trust, TD auto finance canada, TD wealth canada, td direct investing and TD insurance) 
* American retail (TD bank, TD auto finance US, TD wealth US)
* TD securities

They have 14m online customers and 1.7t in assets.  They implemented a deferral program which worked quite well in 2020.  25% of canadian lending accounts took part in this program in april, and by late october, there were only 2.2 percent of accounts still participating.  This likely artificially depressed some financial values such as cash flows, interest payments and accounts receivable which could have been reflected by a lower price, justified if one is speculating but truely an artificial value as loans return to normal. This program accounted for 45.7b in loans.  Similar results were seen in America, with 11.9b in loans, representing 21% of accounts in April later transitioning to 5.2% of accounts.  This is not as attractive as canadian accounts, but is only 25% of the size, and a tiny fraction of balance sheet items, as well as having a shorter deferral period.  

The bank recently carried out what they call the Schwab transaction, where they acquired 13.5% of the Schwab corporation.  This transaction is healthy, and Schwab has about 80% of its market cap covered in cash alone, as well as 6b in FCF for a 120b cap.

TD has managed to increase revenue and net income in 2020.  They allocated more capital for credit losses, but managed to pay less taxes likely in light of the current economic and societal situation.

**Business segment overview:**

They have 16m customers in Canada.  This is almost half of the population, which likely will have a monopolizing effect.  They have credit cards, auto finance services, business banking, merchant solutions, asset management services, and an insurance business in canada.  In the United States they have personal/business banking, and TD ameritrade.  

They operate a wholesale banking segment which operates like any investment bank.  This segment operates under the TD securities brand.

There is a vast segment called the corporate segment which does a number of different operations.  These operations include technology solutions, shared services, treasury and balance sheet management (asset management?), marketing, human resources, finance risk management, compliance \[management\], legal, anti-money laundering, and ?other? Operations.  It seems quite difficult to find information on this segment, other than it has a margin of about -20%, making it even more curious. 

Segment analysis:

All segments other than corporate are profitable, and have similar margins around 25%.  

Canadian retail has seen slight increases every year since 2018.  Net income in this segment has been declining.  A decrease in personal banking revenue by 750m was countered by a 200m increase in business banking, a 400m increase in wealth banking, and a 250m increase in insurance, resulting in increased revenue from 2019 to 2020.  There is quite a high ROE for this segment.  

US retail has seen stable, cyclical revenues with a macro up trend.  Net income significantly dropped in 2020.  Deposits grew in personal and business banking and in sweep.  The ROE in this segment is significantly lower than in the canadian retail segment.

In wholesale banking, there was a sharp increase in revenue and in net income.  This segment has a ROE of 16.9.  They were a part of a number of large name broker actions, acting as an intermediary.  They carry out some trading, research, underwriting, securitization, trade finance, cash management, brokerage, and trade execution services in their global markets segment.  In the corporate/investment banking sector they do corporate lending, debt/equity underwriting and advisory services.

The corporate segment is a number of service and control groups.  It seems to manage tax items, treasury and balance sheet activities, and some other shady sounding operations.  It seems like this segment manages some accounting, as well as some issuance of equities/debt equities.  

The balance sheet is very large.  There was a $300 billion increase from 2019-20.  This was mostly related to a large increase in deposits.  The bank has 718b in loans.  Of these, only about 2b were stage three.  Factoring in allowance for credit loss, there is a possible delinquency rate just below 2 percent at around 12b which is covered 15 times over by cash alone.  With most liabilities in deposits, there is no immediate concern in the balance sheet.  There are almost 200b in securities sold under repurchase agreements, which will be evaluated over at least 5 years, presenting again little threat.  

The loans can be broken down into regional and segmental sections.  Canadian residential mortgages account for 213billion of the loans.  Mortgage delinquency rates in canada are 0.23% as of Jan 31, 2021.  This equates to about 212.5b in real value from the mortgage loans, although TD has allocated about 100 million less than I recommend.  HELOCs account for another adjusted 95 billion.  All together, personal loans account for 369.256b on the balance sheet.  Conservatively taking delinquencies at 1b, this figure is adjusted to 268.256b for analytical purposes.  Real estate represents about 40 billion in canadian loans, and assorted business and government is another 115.2b, predominantly in the financial and consumer staples industries.  All of these loans look healthy at first glance.  

United states loans are similar.  There are 100b in personal loans, 35.4b in real estate, and 148.3 in business and government with a similar allocation as the corresponding canadian section under the same name.  There is 9b in other international loans.  The total is about 734.9b.  There is about a 5.3 percent average increase YOY in pure volume of loans.

TD decisively estimates that 1.3b of loans are in stage 3, which may be a little conservative for most analysts.  Preparing for up to one percent delinquency is in order because of the recent volatility in the market right now as well as in the canadian economy as an expected third wave of Covid-19 expands its grasp.  In table 33 of the 2020 annual report, they allocate 7 billion to credit losses which is much more reasonable because they account for stage 1 and 2 as well. In this time of great uncertainty, it is not unreasonable to change this estimate to 20b.  The bank has apparent backing from the canadian government so there is no immediate threat to allocate a tenth of capital reserves to delinquencies.",1625516382,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oefgp7/td_due_diligence_and_characteristics/

23,investing,JaiminDesai93,Primer on wash sales for newer investors,"Simply, wash sales are an IRS rule designed to keep investors from booking artificial losses. Because it's not a well publicized rule, many investors accidentally violate it and cost themselves thousands more in taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

**There are two main ways to violate wash sales.**

1. Rebuying a stock within 30 days of selling it at a loss.

Example: Sell $GOOG for a loss on June 1 and rebuy $GOOG on June 30.

2. Adding to an existing position within 30 days of selling at a loss.

Example: Held 100 shares of $GOOG. Bought 50 more $GOOG on May 1 and then sold 50 shares at a loss on May 20. 

Note: if you closed your entire position on May 20, then there would be no wash sale.

&amp;#x200B;

**Remember:**

Wash sale losses cannot be deducted from your net gains, so it's important to avoid these violations. 

Instead, the loss gets added back to the cost basis of the latest buy. 

Example: $1000 WS loss after buying 10 shares for $100. New cost basis is $11 instead of $10.

24,investing,AIONisMINE,Questions regarding reading the Cash Flow from Financing Activities.,"I am slowly but surely learning more about how to read the SEC and get meaningful information from them. Mostly thanks to reddit for answering questions regarding the particulars.

I am stumped on something else and was wondering if i can get some confirmation. This is regards to looking at corsairs 10k and 10q.

I am trying to find concrete information on exactly how much Corsair paid to buy out Elgato, Origin, and SCUF. and it seems like i have to do some digging because the buy out value is never on any of the articles. I am assuming its because CRSR was a private company when these were purchased?

so digging through the CFF on their 10Q for Q3 of 2020. it states

&gt;Cash used in investing activities was $22.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and consisted of $10.3 million payment for the deferred consideration of Elgato acquisition, $7.0 million for the purchase of capital equipment and software and $4.8 million for the acquisition of Origin.

1. is this flat out saying corsair bought Origin for $4.8MM? under their section of ""Origin Acquisition"" i cant seem to figure out how they got this value.

if so, in their 10K, it states

&gt;Cash used in investing activities was $145.4 million for 2019 and consisted primarily of $126.0 million that was used for the acquisition of SCUF and Origin,

2. does this mean for both SCUF and origin, it costed CRSR $126MM? if yes, does that mean i can deduct that SCUF costed $126MM - $4.8MM?

again how can i find this information better in the SEC filings without digging through multiple overall statements to do the math myself? i would assume it would state somewhere ""corsair bought X for $Y and A for $B"" but i cant seem to find that.

3. also in their 10K, for their 2018 ""Acquisitions of business, net cash acquired"" section, it does $30.210MM. does that mean that the buyout price for Elgato?

reason why i ask question 3 is because it seems like every year, corsair also had something called a ""payment of deferred consideration"". from investopedia it says its simply payment part of the buyout thats paid later. which means a company's real buyout price is ""Acquisions of business, net of cash acquired"" line + every year's listed Payment of deferred consideration? and once again, that is very tedious and annoying. And again, is there a way i can simply find ""CRSR bought Elgato for $$$x"" ??",1625514450,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oeetmw/questions_regarding_reading_the_cash_flow_from/

at the moment I am invested with 200k in stocks. About 50% in ETFs, about 20% in individual stocks and 30% I use for trading options (european version). This is working out quite well for me. 

But my wife and I have a dream of an own house with a garden. Prices are hell high at the moment but somehow thats always been the case in the last years. 

So with my income of approx 6k a month and with my 200k I can easily get a credit of 800k to build my dream house. The land we want alone costs about 400k. 

But here is my problem:
I have to sell all my investments and then pay off a credit. So I will switch from a financial comfortable to a credit situation without any investing. 4 months a year i pay off the interest of the bank and 8 months a year I pay off the credit. 

I am 35 now. 

But on the other hand: what am I investing for? To be able to get things i desire and to live a peacefull life without money issues.

62,investing,Peacetoletov,"Growth stocks do not grow your capital, dividend stocks are not good for retirement","I've seen way too many misconceptions about growth and dividend stocks on this sub recently.

Let's address growth stocks first. They are not called growth stocks because they would grow your capital. They are instead called growth stocks because they have high prices relative to some fundemental measures (P/B, P/E etc.), and they are the opposite of value stocks. We are currently experiencing a period where growth stocks have massively outperformed value stocks, and I assume that's why most people think that growth stocks are good investments. However, there is strong theoretical and empirical evidence that over the long term, value stocks provide much superior return.

Is the value premium dead? Nobody knows for sure, but I'm much more confident in an investment class that had been consistently outperforming for the last 100 years, rather than the last decade or so.

Second, let's talk about dividends and retirement. I find it hard to believe that so many people see dividends as some sort of magic cheat code for bad markets or passive income. It does not matter whether you receive cash in the form of a dividend, or by selling some of your shares (pre-tax at least). Your mental accounting bias does not change that, regardless of market conditions. If your goal is lower portfolio volatility, add more bonds. Dividend paying stocks are still stocks. They can easily lose most of their value, no matter how ""mature"" the company is or how ""conservative"" the management is.",1625498072,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oe9fer/growth_stocks_do_not_grow_your_capital_dividend/

one is before taxes, interest, depreciation etc., the other is after interest but before taxes, then another is after substracting everything..

71,investing,Wanderer1066,Alternative to bonds in this low interest rate environment.,"Bonds historically have served as a way to hedge your risk in an equity bear market. The problem is that in recent years that inverse correlation has broken down. Bonds are not serving their purpose, and it has prompted many articles proclaiming “the 60/40 portfolio is dead” (the 60/40 portfolio is a mix of 60% equities and 40% bonds. It was trumpeted as the go to allocation for decades). 

So given the fairly simple and easy solution past generations enjoyed isn’t available to us. What should we do? Well you can accomplish the same goal, but to do it, we must use different tools. 

A put option contract gives you the right to sell 100 shares at an agreed upon price, for a period of time. For example, currently SPY is trading at $433. If you want to cap your potential loss at a maximum of 10% for the next 1.5 months, you could buy the $390 put that expires on 8/20. This example was not chosen randomly. One of the best ways to gain the stability we’ve lost is around this sweet spot. This put option will cost roughly $150 per contract, and when one expires, you buy another one, for a total of 8 per year. 

Per 100 shares of SPY: 

1. 100* $433/share = $43,300 

2. $150 * 8                = ($1,200)

3. 2.15% * $43,300 = $930.95

(The average dividend yield of SPY the last 10 years has been 2.15%, which is why is why we’re using 2.15%.)


4. Net of 2&amp;3           = $269.05

The cost to cap losses at 10% and simply maintain a 100% SPY portfolio will, if these assumptions hold, cost .62%. 

Ps. You may be asking: why don’t I just buy a put for 1 year out and do that each year? Good question! The answer is that it’s more expensive. As opposed to the roughly $1200 cost of protection per 100 shares each year, that will cost you about $1900 per 100 shares.",1625495162,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oe8gig/alternative_to_bonds_in_this_low_interest_rate/
77,investing,Phynaes,What type of bonds do you buy for a bond tent?,"One of the Sequence of Returns Risks mitigation strategies is to be heavy on equities going into retirement and then to build up a bond tent for the first few years of retirement before transitioning back to a larger equity position, to maintain capital through a longer retirement.

I suppose to an extent it depends on how long this bond tent is supposed to last, since you're supposed to buy bonds that match the duration you plan to hold them, but if so, doesn't this mean that you'd actually have to set up a sort of 'bond ladder tent' of ultra-short, short, and intermediate bonds, primarily treasuries, to keep you safe through the transition period? Or do you just buy intermediate treasuries and accept a potential loss selling a portion of them earlier than their duration match if something weird happens with interest rates during the first few years of your retirement?

79,investing,notapersonaltrainer,An update on Bitcoin miners,"A lot has changed since my [introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mq3sz8/guide_to_bitcoin_mining_stocks/) to the bitcoin mining sector. The great miner [exodus](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/chinas-bitcoin-miner-exodus-.html) as part of China's larger tech crackdown has begun and has drastically changed the [economics](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/03/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-drops-after-hashrate-collapse-in-china-.html) of mining. There are three catalysts of interest for the sector happening at once.

***

**Margins have [increased](https://twitter.com/PeterGWall/status/1411307908378284037) at least 30% overnight**

Bitcoin has a [difficulty adjustment](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty) to adapt to hashrate changes. 

&gt;What this means for miners, is for the same amount of hash power, miners are getting significantly more Bitcoin - over 30% more, in some cases. 

&gt;Margins for miners with new generation machines are close to when BTC was 65k. Remarkable.

**A flood of used machines entered the market**

Prices for machines have dropped as chinese miners look for hosting capacity around the world. Expansion for capital rich western miners has become a lot cheaper. Bitmain has even ceased new orders.

Hosting seems to be the limiting factor. It was already fully occupied so it will take 6-18 months for new capacity to be built and absorb the miners. This also creates some investment opportunities for hosting companies like Core Scientific, Northern Digital. 

**Three large mining stocks just uplisted to Nasdaq**

HUT8, Bitfarms, and Hive Blockchain have uplisted to Nasdaq Global Select Market, Nasdaq Global Market, and Nasdaq Capital market tiers respectively (highest to lowest). Argo is in the application process.

These stocks have competitive hashrates to giants Mara and Riot with a fraction of the market cap and one to two higher tier listings (higher tier = more access to capital and meets stricter balance sheet requirements). [RandomInvestor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1oo5MvK4Uo) and [Cheshire_cat](https://imgur.com/a/JCecGrz) are doing some great analysis right now.

These stocks currently have a confluence of catalysts: Uplisting + access to capital + increased margins + suppressed stock price + discounted machine acquisition

Note: These are all in the [BLOK](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok-holdings.html) etf as well as some hosting companies.

***

This is a very interesting inflection point in the sector for those who have been interested. These miners could experience significant price appreciation even if BTC continues to range and much more if price appreciates on top of these new margins.",1625491781,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oe7eur/an_update_on_bitcoin_miners/

About ten years ago when I really got interested in money and investments, I was asking friends and looking at message boards for investment advice. Everyone told me to put most of my money in ETFs that had a higher than normal dividend yield. These ETFs were recommended and I was told they would give me a higher total return than a standard total stock market fund, like VTI, SPTM, or ITOT.

So I invested over the last ten years much of the money I have in my Vanguard Brokerage Accounts in these high dividend ETFs and now after finding the Portfolio Visualizer website have determined I have lost nearly $100K in stock market gains by buying these high dividend ETFs-listed below- instead of a simple total stock market fund.

Do Hong Kong listed stock provide any additional protection from investors versus the NYSE listed ADRs? I'm assuming that in a black swan event of total US delisting of all Chinese stocks off American exchanges, the HK versions would still trade, though at a discount from present prices. 

If the Chinese government were to close the loophole of listing shell ADRs on American exchanges, would 9988 still legally be able to trade? (albeit at a discount again, due to reduced audience).

There is such a special oil company in Russia - Surgutneftegaz (SNGS\_p). It is one of the largest oil companies in the Russian Federation. The main areas of activity are oil and gas production, oil refining and retail sales. At the same time, Surgutneftegaz has not been considered by Russian investors as a purely oil company for many years. Since 2000, the company began to save money in dollars on deposits. At the end of 2020, their volume was about 3.7 trillion rubles. For comparison: the current capitalization of Surgutneftegaz is 1.6 trillion rubles. At the same time, the dividend yield depends on the revaluation of this dollar piggy bank. Upcoming dividends: 6.72 rubles (14.58% of the current price). Given the trends in the oil market, the systemic increase in energy prices and the increase in demand from emerging economies, this is a promising oil story and an interesting dollar hedge in case the monetary bubble bursts.

As i was looking in to the current market for hydrogen as a fuel for ships. I found out about Teco2030. I wanted to share a couple of my findings with you. 

Teco is a company that is focussing on the reduction of emissions within the shipping industries. The ultimate solution Teco sees for the shipping industie is the use of hydrogen based fuel cells.

Currently Teco is working on the development of the Teco 2030 Marine Fuell Cell System. This system will provide a ship with an emission free propulsion. Teco has signed a letter of intent for the delivery of cells during 2022.

[TECO Marine Fuel Cell – Teco 2030](https://teco2030.no/solutions/teco-marine-fuel-cell/)

While the company is still starting and thus is burning money they already have products that can help both their environmental target and also provide some revenue.

At this point Teco has 2 product ready for delivery:

\- Teco 2030 Future Funnel: This product provides a way to reduce emission. This product is developed to comply with not only existing, but even upcoming and far stricter regulations in the marine industry.

[TECO Future Funnel – Teco 2030](https://teco2030.no/solutions/teco-future-funnel/)

\- Teco 2030 Balast water treatment: A schip carries ballast water to stabilize the ship and its cargo. In order to prevent invasive species end possible health issues, a ship’s ballast has to be threated before being discharged back to sea. While existing ships are not yet required to do so they have to comply before October 2024. 

[TECO Ballast Water Equipment Solutions – Teco 2030](https://teco2030.no/solutions/teco-ballast-water-treatment-system/)

TECO Is very new to the stock market and currently in no ETF abouw hydrogen (at least, what I could find). 

TECO 2030 aims towards an annual fuel cell production capacity of 400 MW in 2025 steadily increasing to 1.2 GW by 2030. Provided the current estimations for future sales prices and expected reached production capacity, this indicates annual revenues of approx. EUR 290 million in 2025 and approx. EUR 600 million in 2030. The EBITDA-margin is expected to be in the range of 10-15 % in 2025 and 15-20 % in 2030

This systematic global macro strategy appears to be a complement to other alternative risk premia — such as trend-following and long-short value, momentum, and carry strategies — and does not appear to be fully exploited by existing global macro managers.*

**- - - My Summary (in layman’s terms)**

Global macro is a type of investing that involves looking at macroeconomic factors, well, globally. These factors include stuff like unemployment, business cycles, interest rates, international trade, and monetary policy (actions of the Fed and central banks around the world). Global macro investors make predictions based on studying these factors to figure out their outlook for the economy, and invest accordingly. This means their investment universe is much larger than just stocks. They look at long-term government bonds, currencies, and interest rate-affected assets (like short term bonds).

Momentum trading is a strategy that typically involves looking at trends in stock prices and assuming that those trends will keep on going for a short period. For example, if there is upward momentum on a stock, momentum traders want to get in now while it’s still going up. Clearly, this is usually a short-term trading strategy.

In a nutshell, macro momentum is a macro investing strategy that pulls from momentum strategies. Instead of looking at price trends, it looks at macroeconomic trends. It goes long (buys) assets that have positive macroeconomic indicators (explained below) and short (sells) if vice versa. The four asset types this strategy looks at are stocks, currencies, long-term government bonds, and short-term bonds (the paper calls this “global interest rates”). The four macroeconomic indicators this strategy looks at are business cycles (generally, how is the economy doing), monetary policy (what is the Fed doing, is it conservative or aggressive), international trade, and risk sentiment (are stocks going up or down). 

[Exhibit 1: Summary of Macro Momentum Indicators](https://i.imgur.com/x1nJJcF.png)

Let’s talk through how I think about this, starting with the column “Increasing Growth.” If the economy is doing well, people have money, so they invest their money into stocks, making the outlook good for stocks. Stocks usually give more of a return than bonds, so their demand goes down, as does their price, making the outlook worse for longer term and shorter term bonds — I’m aware this isn’t the full picture but it’s how I think about it, bond folks please chip in if you’d like to add anything here. Growth is good for currencies as it is accompanied by more business and foreign investment, meaning more demand for the currency - the paper talks about the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis here, which pretty much says countries with high productivity and therefore prices for tradable goods have higher prices for services too (developed countries vs. developing countries).

Moving to int’l trade, this is captured by looking at whether the currency is depreciating (getting weaker, purchasing power decreasing) on a 1-year basis. Depreciating currency is good for stocks (because our currency is weaker compared to int’l currencies, our goods are relatively cheaper and there’s more demand for them and the companies that sell them), bad for currencies (similar idea to momentum, if currencies have been depreciating, we expect them to continue), and bad for bonds and interest rates. For this last bit, here’s how I think about it — if my currency is depreciating and getting weaker than other currencies, global investors don’t want to be holding it (effectively, its “price” is decreasing). Something that makes a currency attractive is a high interest rate, so parking your money in that currency earns you interest, so a weakening currency’s central bank has less incentive to decrease rates. The price of bonds and other interest rate products increases as rates decrease, meaning this environment/scenario is overall negative for bonds.

Monetary policy, captured by looking at 1-year changes in the yield curve - this is where the x axis is the term of the bond and the y axis is the interest rate paid, it’s usually upward sloping in a good economy and downward in a bad one. If the Fed gets tighter (money printer out of ink), this is bad for stocks and bonds because there’s not as much money to go into these; and it’s good for currencies because it decreases the money supply and increases interest rates (more int’l investment into our currency).

Finally, the risk sentiment is captured by looking at 1-year stock market returns. Increasing risk sentiment is when the stock market has strong returns. This is good for stocks (momentum) and currencies (int’l investment into our stocks), and bad for bonds (who wants to invest in bonds when stocks are doing so well).

**- - - Creating a Macro Momentum Portfolio**

With this in mind, we now want to create our macro momentum portfolio. This will consist of a long-short portfolio (LS) and a directional portfolio (D) for each combo of indicators and assets. So there’s four indicators times four asset types times two types of portfolios meaning we’ll have 32 “sub” portfolios total that we’ll then combine into the final macro momentum portfolio. 

LS — these are market neutral. This portfolio takes a long position in assets with favorable trends (above the average) and short for the assets with unfavorable trends (below the average). Because we’re doing all this with the average in mind, there’s a theoretical neutral exposure to the market, meaning this should perform despite market movements.

D — these take long positions in assets with favorable trends and shorts in assets with unfavorable trends, meaning there’s no computation of an average, and the portfolio can be long or short-exposed.

So we have a LS portfolio for stocks using the economic growth (business cycle) indicator, a D portfolio for the same, an LS for stocks using int’l trade as an indicator, a D portfolio for the same, etc. Once we have the 32 total, he aggregate macro momentum portfolio is created by taking an equal weight across all 32 asset-indicator portfolios.

It’s easy to get lost in the specifics here, so I’ll repeat what we’re doing from a bird’s eye view again. We’re looking at 4 macroeconomic indicators from generally the past year, applying those indicators to 4 asset classes to make a table like the above, and then pretty much using those indicators to predict how the asset classes will perform over the next year. Rebalanced annually.

**- - - Performance**

This portfolio was tested from Jan 1970 to Dec 2016. That means it’s seen the bear markets of 1987, 2000, and 2008, but not 2020. It’s also seen recessions, wars, stagflation, and disinflation. Here are the results in a table:

[Exhibit 3: Macro Momentum Strategy Performance since 1970](https://i.imgur.com/bbeBBzU.png)

Let’s unpack this. Looks like a consistently market-beating strategy that is un-correlated with the stock and bond markets. One question you might have is, “if this is so good, why doesn’t AQR just invest fully in it?“ The best answer here is probably liquidity — as a fund with \~$150B in assets, it’s impossible to employ your capital all in one strategy without affecting prices enough that you’d no longer be beating markets. Also, AQR’s only been around since 1998, and although I’m sure they had this research in some way or another before the paper was published, it did just come out in 2017.

The table shows a CAGR for the strat (without accounting for inflation) of 13%, compared to [8.41% for the S&amp;P](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm). It beats its composite assets' returns in rising yield and falling yield markets, in bull runs and bear markets (on average), and has a higher Sharpe Ratio than the S&amp;P for the period (1.2 vs. around 1.0). It’s non-correlated with bonds and has something of a negative correlation with stocks. Does the latter number mean it goes down when stocks go up, meaning it’s gone down for the majority of the period. No. The paper calls the returns of the strategy a “smile” compared to stock returns. Here’s a graph.

[Exhibit 2: Quarterly Returns, 1970-2016](https://i.imgur.com/ZQO1o8p.png)

When stocks are up, this portfolio is up a bit too (that's called a slightly positive beta). When stocks are down, this portfolio is up a whole lot (a very negative beta). On average, the portfolio has a slightly negative beta compared to stocks, as mentioned earlier.

I've mostly employed the strategy on broad market ETF (VTI, XLK, XLC) but also on a few select stocks that I thought were good values (JPM my best performer so far). 

However, these excess returns are NOT without risk. As some have mentioned in the aforementioned posts the issue is, this strategy ties up A LOT of capital for ATM options. If you plan on using this strategy it'd be wise to go slightly deeper ITM with the options and put up the extra collateral. Not only will the account have a lesser chance of blowing up but you'll also be able to sleep at night because you're account hasn't already blown up :)

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said on its social media feed that it had ordered Didi to make changes to comply with Chinese data protection rules. It did not specify the nature of Didi's violation.

Didi responded by saying it had stopped registering new users and would remove its app from app stores. It said it would make changes to comply with rules and protect users' rights.

Didi's app is still working in China for people who have downloaded it already. It offers over 20 million rides in China every day, on average.

Chinese regulators have tightened data collection rules for major tech firms in recent years.

CAC on Friday announced an investigation into Didi to protect ""national security and the public interest"", two days after the firm began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

I thought I could start contributing to my 2022 Roth IRA account since 2022 came up as a drop-down item, but apparently, that’s not the case. As a result, I’m really not sure what I should do with extra money right now (as I don’t have a desire to put more into my 401k). 

Should I:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Hold on to those funds until 1/1/2022 and then put them in the market in a lump sum?
2. Invest the money I have now into an ETF in a non-retirement account, either in a lump sum or aggressively in periods for the next few months? (I have an E-Trade and Robinhood account with some stocks that I plan to hold on to long-term while others I bought “for fun”/to play around with.)

2,investing,xxx69harambe69xxx,how long does it take for the market to react to interest rate changes when they're expected well in advance as they are now?,"Its pretty clear from the recent moves that the market has moved back into risk on mode, which is interesting because its also pretty clear that the market absorbed the FOMC meeting last week w/ hardly much to the downside. That kinda signals to me that really the big investors arent too concerned with interest rates rising, because they have already priced it into their models, as opposed to inflation which was not priced in, hence the past two months correction to risky growth stocks.

With all that said, I still cant imagine that an FOMC meeting will occur where the FED announces interest rate increases and the market doesnt fall at all

For those who have been in the market longer than me, can you remember a time where we were at ATH's and an FOMC announcement of fed funds rate hikes did NOT cause a fall? Furthermore, if there always was a fall, is there usually a number of days prior to the FOMC meetings that the selloffs begin, or do people ride that risk right into the announcement itself?

Im not one to believe in timing the markets, but sometimes things are a bit too obvious about what will spur a downside catalyst. We've already expended the inflation fears, biden+congress most likely intend to announce even more spending right into elections, and covid fears are abating + recovery is decent with still lots of home purchases. There's not much else out there to act as a catalyst for a blown off top

it must be tapering or interest rates, and so that relies on the FOMC announcements and the fed president press releases",1625376172,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oddyaa/how_long_does_it_take_for_the_market_to_react_to/
4,investing,Panzercannon03,Why dont more people buy synthetic longs? Is there something I'm missing?,"(A synthetic  long is where you buy a call and sell a put at the same strike price, often close to the underlying price)

Often when you use a synthetic long, the actual  debit is small compared to the price of the call by itself. In some cases the difference  is enough between the long call and the short put that I get even a small credit.

If you're  bullish the gains you get are basically free....since your actual premium  was so low. And if there's  a really strong bullish rally you can buy the short put back for pennies. I've seen this happen a few times with TSLA and AMC synthetic  longs. After I buy the put back: my out of pocket cost is extremely  small....I can let the remaining long run with little consequence. 

This strategy  is even more awesome for LEEP options: as all you really pay is the difference  between the short put and long call. If there's  a stock you're  long term bullish on: buy a synthetic  long Leep spread. When a rally happens, buyout the put and you got a cheap LEEP. And because  you bought a leep spread: it's unlikely  the short put would get executed early (but of course can happen), as the put buyer's breakeven needs much larger losses than a weekly put. 

Can someone tell me what I'm missing?

In programming, sites such as w3schools has that ""try it out"" section that allows you to play with what they just taught. Paper trading from my understanding would just be using real time data and doing what-ifs.

I did that with a meme stock back in February and it backfired. However, I thought about selling my shares of a few other stocks I’m less confident in that are in my portfolio to add to my position of this stock.

Long story short, I am looking to dump a small chunk of money on a stock I currently own, B.FLY Net.Work (spelled this way because I’m not sure if we’re allowed to say the real name on here). I would be averaging down and I also believe this stock will perform well in the long-term. I won’t need the money right away and wasn’t sure if this was a smart move. I figured since I’m young it should be fine to risk it. I have other stocks that I don’t plan on selling (SE, MSFT, AAPL, etc.) It would be a huge percentage of my portfolio which I’ve heard and learned the hard way not to make newer growth stocks a big part of your investments, however as I’ve said I believe in it in the long-term. Does anyone have any experience with doing something like this? Or is this a flat out bad idea? I planned on selling my position in N.NDM and adding to it that way, along with a few other less confident stocks. I’d basically be getting rid of my other speculative stocks that I feel I should’ve never invested in in the first place since it’ll take awhile to break even on those anyways, if it ever happens at all, to put on B.FLY.

I'll use ARKF as a reference.  currently trading at $53.32

&amp;#x200B;

So my understanding of the strategy is you look for a value way out. I'm currently looking at dec 17 2021.  So with a call option, I guess it makes sense to find a price lower than 53.32.   


So if I have strike prices between 25-50, i find the corresponding Ask price and multiply by 100 and thats what I'd pay for the option?   


so a $25 SP has an ask at 28.80  and 50SP has ask of 6.90.   


So I pay between $2880 and $690 and get 100 shares of Arkf?  


But then what? Do I just wait till Dec 17, and hope it doesnt drop below $25. Or am I hoping it exceeds $25-$50?   


When that date comes and I'm still holding,  that just means I purchase the stocks at the $25-$50 price I correct?   


Does this mean I can't sell until Dec 17th? if say the stock goes to $80?   


I'm just confused when and how I gain my profits. Or what would create a loss.

Let’s say I myself had 50k and would accept family and friends to pass me a couple thousand they wouldn’t know what to do with. Let’s say 5k from a relative. 

So now I have 55k. (5/50)K is 10%. Out of fairness since that 5k is now been absorbed into my portfolio which is 10% of the whole balance. They’d be entitled to 10% gross but there’d be taxes and fees (as a Canadian there are broker fees) and of course I’d want to take a little commission for the work. 

There’s also a little consideration that let’s say before they added to my fund, maybe I had positions already it’s not like I just started it with cash not yet invested. What if I had invested in a stock that 10x way before I accepted an outside investor, would they be entitled to 7-9% of my position?

Hi David-
 
CRAZY day today, to be sure.  The Google policy-shift noise was the source of our weakness today…and was severely misinterpreted by investors today…
 
https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557390/google-apk-app-bundles-package-format-play-store
 
 There are scarier, more (wrongfully-)opinionated versions of the same story floating around out there today, some of which seem to wish to imply that Google is working to effectively remove all other app install sources.  This is UNTRUE – we are fully onboard with Google in this “bundle” effort that is rooted in other, more logical incentives.  Most importantly, this has ZERO impact on our business (we fully applaud the movement to app bundles and support app bundles already as part of our platform).
 
There is NO way that our stock should be down on this noise.  
 
 Total madness today.  Speculation led to outright fear.  We fully support Google’s efforts in this area…just as they fully accept &amp; support our participation in the ecosystem.  Our business is just as fully healthy as it was yesterday…and will ideally continue to be going forward.
